 item 1a risk factors 

we face various important risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition and as a result cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock  

risks related to our business and operations 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions globally and in particular in the markets in which our clients and operations are concentrated 

global macroeconomic conditions have a significant effect on our business as well as the businesses of our clients volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions could cause our clients to reduce postpone or cancel spending on projects with us and could make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast client demand and have available the right resources to profitably address such client demand clients may reduce demand for services quickly and with little warning which may cause us to incur extra costs where we have employed more personnel than client demand supports 

our business is particularly susceptible to economic and political conditions in the markets where our clients or operations are concentrated our revenues are highly dependent on clients located in the united states and europe and any adverse economic political or legal uncertainties or adverse developments including due to the uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic may cause clients in these geographies to reduce their spending and materially adversely impact our business many of our clients are in the financial services and healthcare industries so any decrease in growth or significant consolidation in these industries or regulatory policies that restrict these industries may reduce demand for our services economic and political developments in india where a significant majority of our operations and technical personnel are located or in other countries where we maintain delivery operations may also have a significant impact on our business and costs of operations as a developing country india has experienced and may continue to experience high inflation and wage growth fluctuations in gross domestic product growth and volatility in currency exchange rates any of which could materially adversely affect our cost of operations additionally we benefit from governmental policies in countries that encourage foreign investment and promote the ease of doing business such as tax incentives and any change in policy or circumstances that results in the elimination of such benefits or degradation of the rule of law or imposition of new adverse restrictions or costs on our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic has had a significant and continuing adverse impact upon and this or other pandemics may have a material adverse impact upon our business liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

the ongoing global covid19 pandemic has caused and continues to cause significant loss of life and interruption to the global economy and has resulted in the curtailment of activities by businesses and consumers in much of the world as governments and others seek to limit the spread of the disease including through business and transportation shutdowns and restrictions on people’s movement and congregation among other things many of our and our clients’ offices have been closed and employees have been working from home and many consumerfacing businesses have closed or are operating at a significantly reduced level to observe various social distancing requirements and governmentmandated measures the overall result has included a dramatic reduction in activity in the global economy and significant adverse impacts to the financial markets including the trading price of our common stock in the past and potentially in the future 

the covid19 pandemic has had a significant and continuing adverse impact upon and this or other pandemics may have a material adverse impact upon our business liquidity results of operations and financial condition including as a result of the following 

• reduced client demand for services – the vast majority of our business is with clients in the united states the united kingdom and other countries in europe all regions that have been hard hit by the pandemic the covid19 pandemic at times reduced and other future pandemics could reduce demand for our services particularly in regions that have been hit hard by the pandemic and from clients in the retail consumer goods travel and hospitality and communications and media industries future client demand for services will depend on the course of the pandemic including whether covid19 vaccines will be sufficiently effective against variant viruses of covid19 other factors such as measures taken by governments and businesses in affected areas that could negatively impact our clients and our business and any economic disruption from new waves of pandemic infections 

• delivery challenges – due to the closures of many of our clients facilities including as a result of various orders from national state or local governments we have faced and may continue to face in the near term or in future pandemics challenges in delivering services to our clients and satisfying contractually agreed upon service levels the pandemic particularly in india but also in the philippines and other countries where we have nearshore or 



  

offshore delivery operations for clients as well as our incountry offices and offices of clients where our employees may normally work has impacted and may continue to impact our ability to deliver services to clients our workfromhome arrangements for many of our employees may increase our exposure to security breaches or cyberattacks a significant worsening of the pandemic particularly in india or a future security incident during the pandemic could materially impair our ability to deliver services to clients to an extent that may have a material adverse impact to our business liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

• increased costs – we could face increased costs in the future depending on developments relating to the pandemic including as a result of the resurgence or persistence of the covid19 pandemic and the emergence of vaccine resistant strains of the virus 

• diversion of and strain on management and other corporate resources – addressing the significant personal and business challenges presented by the pandemic including various business continuity measures and the need to enable workfromhome arrangements for many of our employees has demanded significant management time and attention and strained other corporate resources and is expected to continue to do so among other things this may adversely impact our client and associate development and our ability to execute our strategy and various transformation initiatives 

• reduced employee morale and productivity – the significant personal and business challenges presented by a pandemic including the covid19 pandemic such as the potentially lifethreatening health risks to employees and their families and friends the closures of schools and the unavailability of various services our employees may rely upon such as childcare have been and may be a cause of employee morale concerns and may adversely impact employee productivity it is important for key groups of our employees to resume regular facetoface collaboration the absence of which can negatively impact client and employee engagement and development and our ability to execute our strategy and these employees may be unable to do so due to ongoing concerns of infection 

the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve the ultimate extent to which the pandemic impacts our business liquidity results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the delivery adoption and effectiveness of vaccines future variants of the covid19 virus and any resulting impact on the effectiveness of vaccines the availability of effective treatments for the disease the duration and extent of the pandemic and waves of infection travel restrictions and social distancing the duration and extent of business closures and business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain treat and prevent the disease if we or our clients experience prolonged shutdowns or other business disruptions our business liquidity results of operations financial condition and the trading price of our common stock may be materially adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets may be limited 

if we are unable to attract train and retain skilled employees to satisfy client demand including highly skilled technical personnel and personnel with experience in key digital areas as well as senior management to lead our business globally our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of skilled employees including project managers it engineers and senior technical personnel in particular those with experience in key digital areas in balance with client demand around the world and on our ability to attract and retain senior management with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally in 2021 we experienced unprecedented attrition which was considered industrywide as a result we hired over a hundred thousand new employees and needed to reskill retain integrate and motivate our workforce of over 300000 employees with diverse skills and expertise in order to serve client demands across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technological industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business while we believe the level of attrition in 2021 was unusual we believe it will remain elevated through 2022 and possibly beyond which could materially adversely affect our business we also must continue to maintain an effective senior leadership team that among other things is effective in executing on our strategic goals and growing our digital business the loss of senior executives or the failure to attract integrate and retain new senior executives as the needs of our business require could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

competition for skilled labor is intense and in some jurisdictions and service areas in which we operate and in particular in key digital areas there are more open positions than qualified persons to fill these positions our business has experienced and may continue to experi ence s ignificant employee attrition which has caused us to incur increased costs to hire new employees with the desired skills while we strive to adjust pricing to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our operating margin we may not be successful in recovering these increases which could adversely affect our profitability and operating margin costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant if we are unable to hire or deploy employees with the needed skillsets or if we are unable to adequately equip our employees with the skills needed this could materially adversely affect our business additionally if we are unable to maintain an employee environment that is 



  

competitive and appealing it could have an adverse effect on engagement and retention which may materially adversely affect our business 

we face challenges related to growing our business organically as well as inorganically through acquisitions and we may not be able to achieve our targeted growth rates 

achievement of our targeted growth rates requires continued significant organic growth of our business as well as inorganic growth through acquisitions to achieve such growth we must among other things continue to significantly expand our global operations increase our product and service offerings in particular with respect to digital and scale our infrastructure to support such business growth continued business growth increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management employees operations systems delivery financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions which we will have to continue to develop and improve to sustain such growth our ability to successfully manage change associated with the various business transformation initiatives is critical for the overall strategy execution we must continually recruit and train new employees retain and reskill as necessary existing sales technical finance marketing and management employees with the knowledge skills and experience that our business model requires and effectively manage our employees worldwide to support our culture values strategies and goals additionally we expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and investments to enhance our offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand our talent experience and capabilities in key digital areas or in particular geographies or industries we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities completing targeted transactions or achieving the desired results and such opportunities may divert our managements time and focus away from our core business we may face challenges in effectively integrating acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and in assimilating and retaining employees of those businesses into our culture and organizational structure if we are unable to manage our growth effectively complete acquisitions of the number magnitude and nature we have targeted or successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our targeted growth rates or improve our market share profitability or competitive position generally or in specific markets or services 

we may not be able to achieve our profitability goals and maintain our capital return strategy 

our goals for profitability and capital return rely upon a number of assumptions including our ability to improve the efficiency of our operations and make successful investments to grow and further develop our business our profitability depends on the efficiency with which we run our operations and the cost of our operations especially the compensation and benefits costs of our employees we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial costs related to implementing our strategy to optimize such costs and we may not realize the ultimate cost savings that we expect we may not be able to efficiently utilize our employees if increased regulation policy changes or administrative burdens of immigration work visas or client worksite placement prevents us from deploying our employees on a timely basis or at all to fulfill the needs of our clients increases in wages and other costs including as a result of attrition may put pressure on our profitability fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can also have adverse effects on our revenues income from operations and net income when items denominated in other currencies are translated or remeasured into us dollars for presentation of our consolidated financial statements we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts intended to partially offset the impact of the movement of the exchange rates on future operating costs and to mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign currency denominated net monetary assets however the hedging strategies that we have implemented or may in the future implement to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market operational and counterparty credit risks we are particularly susceptible to wage and cost pressures in india and the exchange rate of the indian rupee relative to the currencies of our client contracts due to the fact that the substantial majority of our employees are in india while our contracts with clients are typically in the local currency of the country where our clients are located if we are unable to improve the efficiency of our operations our operating margin may decline and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected failure to achieve our profitability goals could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

with respect to capital return our ability and decisions to pay dividends and repurchase shares depend on a variety of factors including the cash flow generated from operations our cash and investment balances our net income our overall liquidity position potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions and anticipated future economic conditions and financial results failure to carry out our capital return strategy may adversely impact our reputation with shareholders and shareholders’ perception of our business and the trading price of our common stock 

our failure to meet specified service levels or milestones required by certain of our client contracts may result in our client contracts being less profitable potential liability for penalties or damages or reputational harm 

many of our client contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreedupon performance standards or milestones failure to satisfy these requirements could significantly reduce our fees under the contracts increase 



  

the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms or harm our reputation the use of new technologies in our offerings can expose us to additional risks if those technologies fail to work as predicted which could lead to cost overruns project delays financial penalties or damage to our reputation clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damages claims for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments some of our contracts provide that a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate as such these provisions may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts and have in the past resulted and could in the future result in significant losses on such contracts 

we face intense and evolving competition and significant technological advances that our service offerings must keep pace with in the rapidly changing markets we compete in 

the markets we serve and operate in are highly competitive subject to rapid change and characterized by a large number of participants as described in “ part i item 1 business competition” in addition to large global competitors we face competition in many geographic markets from numerous smaller local competitors that may have more experience with operations in these markets have wellestablished relationships with our desired clients or be able to provide services and solutions at lower costs or on terms more attractive to clients than we can consolidation activity may also result in new competitors with greater scale a broader footprint or vertical integration that makes them more attractive to clients as a single provider of integrated products and services in addition concurrent use by many clients of multiple professional service providers means that we are required to be continually competitive on the quality scope and pricing of our offerings or face a reduction or elimination of our business if we are not able to successfully apply market level pricing and manage discounts we may face downward pressure on gross margins and profitability 

our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology to serve the evolving needs of our clients examples of areas of significant change include digital cloud and securityrelated offerings which are continually evolving as well as developments in areas such as ai augmented reality automation blockchain iot quantum computing and asaservice solutions if we do not sufficiently invest in new technologies successfully adapt to industry developments and changing demand and evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale to keep pace with the demands of the markets we serve we may be unable to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and execute on our growth strategy which would materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our relationships with our third party alliance partners who supply us with necessary components to the services and solutions we offer our clients are also critical to our ability to provide many of our services and solutions that address client demands there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such relationships or that such components will be available on the expected timelines or for anticipated prices among other things such alliance partners may in the future decide to compete with us form exclusive or more favorable arrangements with our competitors or otherwise reduce our access to their products impairing our ability to provide the services and solutions demanded by clients 

we face legal reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client andor cognizant data from security breaches andor cyberattacks 

in order to provide our services and solutions we depend on global information technology networks and systems to process transmit host and securely store electronic information including our confidential information and the confidential information of our clients and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients suppliers and alliance partners including numerous cloud service providers security breaches employee malfeasance or human or technological error create risks of shutdowns or disruptions of our operations and potential unauthorized access andor disclosure of our or our clients’ sensitive data which in turn could jeopardize projects that are critical to our operations or the operations of our clients’ businesses and have other adverse impacts on our business or the business of our clients 

like other global companies we and our clients suppliers alliance partners including numerous cloud service providers and other vendors we interact with face threats to data and systems including by nation state threat actors insider threats perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks computer viruses malware worms bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate client information and cause system failures and disruptions for example in april 2020 we announced a security incident involving a maze ransomware attack the attack resulted in unauthorized access to certain data and caused significant disruption to our business 

a security compromise of our information systems or of those of businesses with which we interact that results in confidential information being accessed by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to 



  

regulatory actions client attrition due to reputational concerns or otherwise containment and remediation expenses and claims brought by our clients or others for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or data protection laws monetary damages imposed on us could be significant and may impose costs in excess of insurance policy limits or not be covered by our insurance at all techniques used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems continuously evolve and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of our information systems diverting resources from other projects and disrupting our businesses any remediation measures that we have taken or that we may undertake in the future in response to the security incident announced in april 2020 or other security threats may be insufficient to prevent future attacks 

we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the united states the united kingdom the european union and in other jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection use and transfer of personal data these laws can include stringent compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data as well as potential for significant financial penalties for noncompliance the court of justice of the european union decision in the schrems ii ruling in july 2020 on data transfer requirements has caused significant uncertainty for businesses transferring data outside of the european union which will likely result in continuing compliance and remediation costs 

in the united states federal sectoral laws such as the health insurance portability and accountability act and recently enacted state legislation such as the california consumer privacy act and its successor the california privacy rights act that will go into effect on january 1 2023 impose or will impose extensive privacy requirements on organizations that handle personal data proposals for federal privacy legislation continue and other new state privacy sectoral laws such as virginia and colorado are on the horizon additionally in india the personal data protection bill 2019 continues to make progress through the indian parliament if enacted in its current form it would impose stringent obligations on the handling of personal data including certain localization requirements for sensitive data penalties align with those in other regimes with proposed fines of up to 4 of annual turnover as defined in the bill other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies or our clients pursuant to our contractual obligations relating to our compliance with these regulations complying with changing regulatory requirements requires us to incur substantial costs exposes us to potential regulatory action or litigation and may require changes to our business practices in certain jurisdictions any of which could materially adversely affect our business operations and operating results 

if our risk management business continuity and disaster recovery plans are not effective and our global delivery capabilities are impacted our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and we may suffer harm to our reputation 

our business model is dependent on our global delivery capabilities which include coordination between our delivery centers in india our other global and regional delivery centers the offices of our clients and our associates worldwide system failures outages and operational disruptions may be caused by factors outside of our control such as hostilities political unrest terrorist attacks natural disasters including events that may be caused or exacerbated by climate change and public health emergencies and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic affecting the geographies where our people equipment and clients are located for example we have substantial global delivery operations in chennai india a city that has experienced severe rains and flooding as a result of climate change our risk management business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective at predicting or mitigating the effects of such disruptions particularly in the case of catastrophic events or longer term increasingly severe developments that occur as a result of climate change any such disruption may result in lost revenues a loss of clients and reputational damage which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a substantial portion of our employees in the united states united kingdom european union and other jurisdictions rely on visas to work in those areas such that any restrictions on such visas or immigration more generally or increased costs of obtaining such visas or increases in the wages we are required to pay employees on visas may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in these jurisdictions which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

a substantial portion of our employees in the united states and in many other jurisdictions including countries in europe rely upon temporary work authorization or work permits which makes our business particularly vulnerable to changes and variations in immigration laws and regulations including written changes and policy changes to the manner in which the laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced and potential enforcement actions and penalties that might cause us to lose access to such visas the political environment in the united states the united kingdom and other countries in recent years has included significant support for antiimmigrant legislation and administrative changes many of these recent changes have resulted in and various proposed changes may result in increased difficulty in obtaining timely visas that could impact our 



  

ability to staff projects including as a result of visa application rejections and delays in processing applications and significantly increased costs for us in obtaining visas or as a result of prevailing wage requirements for our employees on visas for example in the united states the prior presidential administration adopted a number of policy changes and executive orders designed to limit immigration and the ability of immigrants to be employed including increased scrutiny of the issuance of new and the renewal of existing h1b visa applications and the placement of h1b visa workers on third party worksites i ncreases to the prevailing wage requirements that set a minimum level of compensation for visa holders and for entities where 15 or more of the workers in the united states hold h1b and l1 visas increases in the visa costs for such entities while a number of these policy changes and executive orders failed to be enforced or enacted into law the current administration has continued to explore visa and immigration reform there continues to be political support for potential new laws and regulations relating to visas or immigration and the implementation of these or similar measures in the future may have a material adverse impact on companies like ours that have a substantial percentage of our employees on visas our principal operating subsidiary in the united states utilizes a high number of skilled workers holding h1b and l1 visas and as a result may be subject to increased costs if any such laws regulations policy changes or executive orders go into effect in the eu many countries continue to implement new regulations to move into compliance with the eu directive of 2014 to harmonize immigration rules for intracompany transferees in most eu member states and to facilitate the transfer of managers specialists and graduate trainees both into and within the region the changes have had significant impact on mobility programs and have led to new notification and documentation requirements for companies sending employees to eu countries recent changes or any additional adverse revisions to immigration laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may cause us delays staffing shortages additional costs or an inability to bid for or fulfill projects for clients any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

legal regulatory and legislative risks 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted and negative perceptions associated with offshore outsourcing could impair our ability to serve our clients and materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the practice of outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in the united states which is our largest market as well as other regions in which we have clients for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by us companies have been put forward for consideration by the us congress and in state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs domestically if any such measure is enacted our ability to provide services to our clients could be impaired 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about purported negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as alleged domestic job loss and theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data particularly involving service providers in india current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from utilizing global service delivery providers like us due to negative perceptions that may be associated with using global service delivery models or firms any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward global service delivery would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide the majority of their services from within the country in which our clients operate 

we are subject to numerous and evolving legal and regulatory requirements and client expectations in the many jurisdictions in which we operate and violations of unfavorable changes in or an inability to meet such requirements or expectations could harm our business 

we provide services to clients and have operations in many parts of the world and in a wide variety of different industries subjecting us to numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations on matters as diverse as trade controls and sanctions immigration including temporary work authorizations or work permits content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation antitrust laws anticorruption laws including the fcpa and the uk bribery act the environment government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy intellectual property employment and labor relations we face significant regulatory compliance costs and risks as a result of the size and breadth of our business for example we may experience increased costs in 2022 and future years for employment and postemployment benefits in india as a result of the issuance of the code in late 2020 in addition we may face costs and risks associated with uncertainty as to the ongoing regulatory impact of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union 

we are also subject to a wide range of potential enforcement actions audits or investigations regarding our compliance with these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business and any finding of a violation could subject us to a wide range of civil or criminal penalties including fines debarment or suspension or disqualification from government contracting prohibitions or restrictions on doing business loss of clients and business legal claims by clients and damage to our reputation 



  

we commit significant financial and managerial resources to comply with our internal control over financial reporting requirements but we have in the past identified and may in the future identify material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that cause us to incur incremental remediation costs in order to maintain adequate controls for example in recent years we had to spend significant resources on conducting an internal investigation and cooperating with investigations by the doj and the sec both concluded in 2019 focused on whether certain payments relating to companyowned facilities in india were made in violation of the fcpa and other applicable laws 

governmental bodies investors clients and businesses are increasingly focused on esg issues which has resulted and may in the future continue to result in the adoption of new laws and regulations reporting requirements and changing buying practices if we fail to comply with new laws regulations or reporting requirements or keep pace with esg trends and developments or fail to meet the expectations of our clients and investors our reputation and business could be adversely impacted 

changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement failure by us to adapt our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements to enhance our global tax profile or adverse outcomes of tax audits investigations or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations and financial condition 

the interpretation of tax laws and regulations in the many jurisdictions in which we operate and the related tax accounting principles are complex and require considerable judgment to determine our income taxes and other tax liabilities worldwide tax laws and regulations affecting us and our clients including applicable tax rates and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations are subject to change as a result of economic political and other factors and any such changes or changes in tax accounting principles could increase our effective worldwide income tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our net income and financial condition we routinely review and update our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements including transfer pricing policies consistent with applicable laws and regulations to align with our evolving business operations and enhance our global tax profile across the numerous jurisdictions such as the united states india and the united kingdom in which we operate failure to successfully adapt our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements to align with our evolving business operations and enhance our global tax profile may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 

the following are several examples of changes in tax laws that may impact us 

• the tax reform act was enacted in december 2017 and made a number of significant changes to the corporate tax regime in the united states we anticipate that the us treasury department will continue to issue interpretive guidance which may modify relevant aspects of the tax regime the us federal government is also considering further tax reform that could increase corporate tax rates 

• the oecd has been working on a base erosion and profit shifting project and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change numerous longstanding tax principles the changes recommended by the oecd have been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business and could lead to disagreements among jurisdictions over the proper allocation of profits among them the oecd has also undertaken a new project focused on “addressing the tax challenges of the digitalization of the economy” this project has proposed implementing a global model for minimum taxation which may impact multinational businesses similarly the european commission and various jurisdictions have introduced proposals to or passed laws that impose a separate tax on specified digital services these recent and potential future tax law changes create uncertainty and may materially adversely impact our provision for income taxes 

our worldwide effective income tax rate may increase as a result of these recent developments changes in interpretations and assumptions made additional guidance that may be issued and ongoing and future actions the company has or may take with respect to our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements 

additionally we are subject from time to time to tax audits investigations and proceedings tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments and are taking increasingly aggressive positions including with respect to our intercompany transactions for example we are currently involved in an ongoing dispute with the itd in which the itd asserts that we owe additional taxes for two transactions by which cts india repurchased shares from its shareholders as more fully described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements adverse outcomes in any such audits investigations or proceedings could increase our tax exposure and cause us to incur increased expense which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 



  

our business subjects us to considerable potential exposure to litigation and legal claims and could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability 

we are subject to and may become a party to a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the conduct of our business our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees clients alliance partners subcontractors suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions whistleblower claims administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable 

our client engagements expose us to significant potential legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to third parties or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients for example third parties could claim that we or our clients whom we typically contractually agree to indemnify with respect to the services and solutions we provide infringe upon their ip rights any such claims of ip infringement could harm our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs in defending ourselves expose us to considerable legal liability or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future we may have to engage in legal action to protect our own ip rights and enforcing our rights may require considerable time money and oversight and existing laws in the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection 

we also face considerable potential legal liability from a variety of other sources our acquisition activities have in the past and may in the future be subject to litigation or other claims including claims from employees clients stockholders or other third parties we have also been the subject of a number of putative securities class action complaints and putative shareholder derivative complaints relating to the matters that were the subject of our now concluded internal investigation into potential violations of the fcpa and other applicable laws and may be subject to such legal actions for these or other matters in the future see  part i item 3 legal proceedings  for more information we establish reserves for these and other matters when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated however the estimation of legal reserves and possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our estimates and materially adversely affect our results of operations

our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries incentivebased compensation stockbased compensation expense employee benefits projectrelated immigration and travel for technical personnel subcontracting and equipment costs relating to revenues the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to savings from the implementation of the delivery cost optimization initiatives of our 2020 fit for growth plan the adverse samlink impact in 2020 a decrease in travel and entertainment costs as a result of a reduction in travel due to the covid19 pandemic as well as the negative impact on our 2020 results from the pandemic and the april 2020 ransomware attack partially offset by increased subcontractor and compensation costs as a result of significantly elevated employee attrition levels

excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges the appreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately 5 basis points in 2021 while in 2020 the depreciation of the indian rupee again st the us dollar positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 92 basis points  each additional 10 change in exchange rate between the indian rupee and the us dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 18 basis points excluding the impact of our cash flow hedges 

we enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge certain indian rupee denominated payments in india these hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the indian rupee in 2021 the settlement of our cash flow hedges positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 35 basis points the impact of the settlement of our cash flow hedges was immaterial in 2020 

we finished the year ended december 31 2021 with approximately 330600 employees as compared to 289500 employees for the year ended december 31 2020 annualized attrition including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 346 for the three months ended december 31 2021 attrition including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 308 for the year ended december 31 2021 in 2021 voluntary attrition was significantly elevated and constituted the vast majority of our attrition for the period by comparison voluntary attrition in the year ended december 31 2020 represented only approximately half of our attrition for the period as our personnel actions taken under our fit for growth plan increased involuntary attrition while voluntary attrition was suppressed due to the covid19 pandemic attrition in all periods presented is weighted towards our more junior level employees 





segment operating profit and operating margin percentage were as follows 

across all our business segments operating margins benefited from savings from the implementation of the delivery cost optimization initiatives of our 2020 fit for growth plan the decrease in travel and entertainment costs due to covid19 related reductions in travel and the negative impact on our 2020 results of the covid19 pandemic and the april 2020 ransomware attack in 2021 segment operating margins were negatively impacted by increased subcontractor and compensation costs as a result of significantly elevated employee attrition levels the 2020 operating margin in our financial services segment includes the 2020 adverse samlink impact 

total segment operating profit was as follows for the year ended december 31 



the increase of 141 million in unallocated costs for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily due to increased costs as a result of our recently completed acquisitions and costs related to initiatives to reposition our brand and the modernization of our core it systems unallocated costs in 2020 included restructuring costs covid19 charges and costs related to the april 2020 ransomware attack 



  



total other income expense net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses interest income and interest expense the following table sets forth total other income expense net for the years ended december 31 



the foreign currency exchange gains and losses were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of the indian rupee denominated net monetary assets and liabilities in our us dollar functional currency india subsidiaries and to a lesser extent the remeasurement of other net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries the gains and losses on our foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments related to the realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to nonus dollar denominated net monetary assets and liabilities as of december 31 2021 the notional value of our undesignated hedges was 847 million the decrease in interest income of 89 million was primarily attributable to lower invested balances in india which generate higher yields our invested balances in india are lower in 2021 as a result of our repatriation of cash from india in the fourth quarter of 2020 





the effective tax rate decreased primarily as a result of 

• our decision in 2020 to reverse our indefinite reinvestment assertion on indian earnings accumulated in prior years which resulted in a 140 million tax on accumulated indian earnings recorded as income tax expense in 2020 

• the 2020 samlink impact  which was not deductible for tax purposes 

• the discrete benefit in 2021 of the settlement of the irs examination for tax years 2012 through 2016 as described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and 

• lower nondeductible foreign currency exchange losses in our consolidated statement of operations in 2021  



the increase in net income was driven by higher income from operations and lower foreign currency exchange losses partially offset by lower interest income 



nongaap financial measures   

portions of our disclosure include nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies in addition these nongaap financial measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements 



  

prepared in accordance with gaap the reconciliations of our nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures set forth below should be carefully evaluated 

our nongaap financial measures adjusted operating margin adjusted income from operations and adjusted diluted eps exclude unusual items additionally adjusted diluted eps excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses and the tax impact of all the applicable adjustments the income tax impact of each item is calculated by applying the statutory rate and local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred constant currency revenue growth is defined as revenues for a given period restated at the comparative period’s foreign currency exchange rates measured against the comparative periods reported revenues free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities net of purchases of property and equipment 

we believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the company provides enhanced transparency into our operating results for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes we use various gaap and nongaap financial measures for financial and operational decisionmaking to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons to determine portions of the compensation for our executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors therefore it is our belief that the use of nongaap financial measures excluding certain costs provides a meaningful supplemental measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance we believe that the presentation of our nongaap financial measures along with reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure as applicable can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 

a limitation of using nongaap financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap is that nongaap financial measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with gaap and may exclude costs that are recurring such as our net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses in addition other companies may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than us thereby limiting the usefulness of these nongaap financial measures as a comparative tool we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from our nongaap financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such nongaap financial measures 

the following table presents a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to the most comparable gaap measure for the years ended december 31 





1 during 2021 we recorded the class action settlement loss in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated financial statements see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information

6 presented below are the tax impacts of each of our nongaap adjustments to pretax income 



7 in 2020 we reversed our indefinite reinvestment assertion on indian earnings accumulated in prior years and recorded 140 million in income tax expense 



cash generated from operations has historically been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments t o grow our business as of december 31 2021 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 2719 million additionally as of december 31 2021 we had available capacity under our credit facilities of approximately 1925 million 

the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 



operating activities 7 

the decrease i n cash provided by operating activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the deferrals of certain nonincome tax payments due to covid19 pandemic regulatory relief in 2020 a portion of which was remitted in 2021 and higher incentivebased compensation payouts in 2021 

we monitor turnover aging and the collection of trade accounts receivable by client our dso calculation includes trade accounts receivable net of allowance for credit losses and contract assets reduced by the uncollected portion of our deferred revenue dso was 69 days as of december 31 2021 and 70 days as of december 31 2020 

investing activities 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by net purchases of investments as compared to sales in 2020 partially offset by lower payments for acquisitions and capital expenditures 

7 free cash flow is not a measurement of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap see “nongaap financial measures” for more information 



  

financing activities 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to lower repurchases of common stock in 2021 

we have a credit agreement providing for a 750 million term loan and a 1750 million unsecured revolving credit facility which are due to mature in november 2023 we are required under the credit agree ment to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the term loan see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the credit agreement to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the remaining available capacity under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2021 and through the date of this filing as of december 31 2021 we had no outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility 

in february 2021 our india subsidiary renewed its oneyear 13 billion indian rupee 175 million at the december 31 2021 exchange rate working capital facility which requires us to repay any balances drawn down within 90 days from the date of disbursement there is a 10 prepayment penalty applicable to payments made within 30 days of disbursement this working capital facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and may be renewed annually in february as of december 31 2021 there was no balance outstanding under the working capital facility 

capital allocation framework 



our capital allocation framework anticipates the deployment of approximately 50 of our free cash flow 8 for acquisitions 25 for share repurchases and 25 for dividend payments we review our capital allocation framework on an ongoing basis considering the pote ntial impacts of covid1 9 pandemic our financial performance and liquidity position investments required to execute our strategic plans and initiatives acquisition opportunities the economic outlook regulatory changes and other relevant factors as these factors may change over time the actual amounts expended on stock repurchase activity dividends and acquisitions if any during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time 

other liquidity and capital resources information 

we seek to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of our domestic and international cash flows and cash balances we evaluate on an ongoing basis what portion of the nonus cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments is needed locally to execute our strategic plans and what amount is available for repatriation back to the united states  

we expect our operating cash flows cash and shortterm investment balances together with our available capacity under our revolving credit facilities to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements pay our purchase commitments and tax reform act transition tax payments and service our debt for the next twelve months our tax reform act transition tax payments are due in annual installments of 50 million 94 million 126 million and 157 million through 2025 we also have purchase commitments of approximately 263 million which will be paid over the next two years see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our operating lease obligations 

our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans make acquisitions meet our longterm capital requirements beyond a twelvemonth period and execute our capital allocation framework will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to pay for acquisitions with capital stock and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we cannot be certain that additional financing if required will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap we base our estimates on historical experience current trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared we evaluate our estimates on a continuous basis however the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements as they require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain changes to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenues related to fixedprice contracts for application development and systems integration services consulting or other technology services are recognized as the service is performed using the cost to cost method under which the total value of revenues is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor costs revenues related to fixedprice application maintenance testing and business process services are recognized using the cost to cost method if the right to invoice is not representative of the value being delivered the cost to cost method requires estimation of future costs which is updated as the project progresses to reflect the latest available information such estimates and changes in estimates involve the use of judgment the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known net changes in estimates of such future costs and contract losses were immaterial to the consolidated results of operations for the periods presented 

income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and related valuation allowance if any and liabilities requires significant judgment we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate in addition transactions between our affiliated entities are arranged in accordance with applicable transfer pricing laws regulations and relevant guidelines as a result and due to the interpretive nature of certain aspects of these laws and guidelines we have pending applications for apas before the taxing authorities in some of our most significant jurisdictions it could take years for the relevant taxing authorities to negotiate and conclude these applications the consolidated provision for income taxes may change period to period based on changes in facts and circumstances such as settlements of income tax audits or finalization of our applications for apas 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of reserves established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related interest which may require us to apply judgment to complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit to the extent that the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

business combinations goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets including indefinitelived intangible assets arise from the accounting for business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed including any contingent consideration and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation of the purchase price utilizes estimates and assumptions in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets including the timing and amount of forecasted revenues and cash flows anticipated growth rates client attrition rates and the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows 

we exercise judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units expected to benefit from each business combination goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate regulatory environment established business plans operating performance indicators or competition evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 



  

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach using market multiples under the income approach we estimate projected future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and longterm growth rates and determine the appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows the discount rate used is based on a market participant weightedaverage cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected future cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenues and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 

based on our most recent evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 we concluded that the goodwill in each of our reporting units were not at risk of impairment as of december 31 2021 our goodwill balance was 5620 million 

we review our finitelived assets including our finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenev er eve nts or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable the carrying amount may not be recoverable when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset groups the impairment loss is determined as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value assessing the fair value of asset groups involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to changes in the value of certain foreign currencies all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures 

revenues from our clients in the united kingdom continental europe and rest of world represented 89 103 and 71 respectively of our 2021 revenues and are typically denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly our revenues may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates primarily th e british pound and the euro a s compared to the us dollar 

a significant portion of our costs in india are denominated in the indian rupee representing 212 of our global operating costs during 2021 and are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india these us dollar  indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs as of december 31 2021 the notional value and weighted average contract rates of these contracts by year of maturity were as follows 



as of december 31 2021 the net unrealized gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges was 66 million based upon a sensitivity analysis at december 31 2021 which estimates the fair value of the contracts assuming certain market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges of approximately 249 million 

a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may result in nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement in 2021 we reported foreign currency exchange losses exclusiv e of hedging losses of approximately 33 million which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries we use foreign exchange forward contracts that are scheduled to mature in 2022 to provide an economic hedge against balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary at december 31 2021 the notional value of these outstanding contracts was 847 million and the net unrealized loss was 4 million based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2021 which estimates the fair value of the contracts assuming certain market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 21 million 

interest rate risk 

we have a credit agreement providing for a 750 million unsecured term loan and a 1750 million unsecured revolving credit facility which are due to mature in november 2023 we are required under the credit agreement to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the term loan 

the credit agreement requires interest to be paid at our option at either the abr the eurocurrency rate or the daily simple rfr each as defined in the credit agreement plus in each case an applicable margin as defined in the credit agreement initially the applicable margin is 0875 with respect to eurocurrency rate and daily simple rfr and 000 



  

with respect to abr loans subsequently the applicable margin with respect to eurocurrency rate and daily simple rfr may range from 075 to 1125 depending on our public debt ratings or if we have not received public debt ratings from 0875 to 1125 depending on our leverage ratio which is the ratio of indebtedness for borrowed money to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement the term loan is a eurocurrency loan thus our debt exposes us to market risk from changes in interest rates we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our interest expense a 100 change in interest rates with all other variables held constant would have an immaterial effect on our reported interest expense

 item 1a risk factors 

we face various important risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition and as a result cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock  

risks related to our business and operations 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions globally and in particular in the markets in which our clients and operations are concentrated 

global macroeconomic conditions have a significant effect on our business as well as the businesses of our clients volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions could cause our clients to reduce postpone or cancel spending on projects with us and could make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast client demand and have available the right resources to profitably address such client demand clients may reduce demand for services quickly and with little warning which may cause us to incur extra costs where we have employed more personnel than client demand supports 

our business is particularly susceptible to economic and political conditions in the markets where our clients or operations are concentrated our revenues are highly dependent on clients located in the united states and europe and any adverse economic political or legal uncertainties or adverse developments including due to the uncertainty related to the potential economic and regulatory impacts of the united kingdoms exit from the european union may cause clients in these geographies to reduce their spending and materially adversely impact our business many of our clients are in the financial services and healthcare industries so any decrease in growth or significant consolidation in these industries or regulatory policies that restrict these industries may reduce demand for our services economic and political developments in india where a significant majority of our operations and technical personnel are located or in other countries where we maintain delivery operations may also have a significant impact on our business and costs of operations as a developing country india has experienced and may continue to experience high inflation and wage growth fluctuations in gross domestic product growth and volatility in currency exchange rates any of which could materially adversely affect our cost of operations additionally we benefit from governmental policies in india that encourage foreign investment and promote the ease of doing business such as tax incentives and any change in policy or circumstances that results in the elimination of such benefits or degradation of the rule of law or imposition of new adverse restrictions or costs on our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic has had a significant and continuing adverse impact upon and this or other pandemics may have a material adverse impact upon our business liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

the ongoing global covid19 pandemic has caused and continues to cause significant loss of life and interruption to the global economy and has resulted in the curtailment of activities by businesses and consumers in much of the world as governments and others seek to limit the spread of the disease including through business and transportation shutdowns and restrictions on people’s movement and congregation among other things many of our and our clients’ offices have been closed and employees have been working from home and many consumerfacing businesses have closed or are operating at a significantly reduced level to observe various social distancing requirements and governmentmandated closures the overall result has been a dramatic reduction in activity in the global economy a reduction in demand for many products and services and significant adverse impacts to the financial markets including the trading price of our common stock in the past and potentially in the future 

the covid19 pandemic has had a significant and continuing adverse impact upon and this or other pandemics may have a material adverse impact upon our business liquidity results of operations and financial condition including as a result of the following 

• reduced client demand for services – the vast majority of our business is with clients in the united states the united kingdom and other countries in europe all regions that have been hard hit by the pandemic the covid19 pandemic has reduced and other future pandemics could reduce demand for our services particularly in regions that have been hit hard by the pandemic and from clients in the retail consumer goods travel and hospitality and communications and media industries and is likely to continue to result in reduced demand for our services as clients across many industries face reduced demand for their products and services among other things some of our clients have postponed cancelled or scaledback existing projects and not entered into or reduced the scope of potential projects and may continue to do so 

• client pricing pressure payment term extensions and insolvency risk – as clients face reduced demand for their products and services reduce their business activity and face increased financial pressure on their businesses we have faced and may continue to face downward pressure on our pricing and gross margins due to pricing 

  

concessions to clients and requests from clients to extend payment terms in addition some of our clients have requested and may continue to request extended payment terms which may have an adverse effect on our cash flows from operations we may also face a significantly elevated risk of client insolvency bankruptcy or liquidity challenges where we may perform services and incur expenses for which we are not paid 

• delivery challenges – due to the closures of many of our and our clients’ facilities including as a result of various orders from national state or local governments we have faced and may continue to face in the near term or in future pandemics challenges in delivering services to our clients and satisfying contractually agreed upon service levels the pandemic particularly in india but also in the philippines and other countries where we have nearshore or offshore delivery operations for clients as well as our incountry offices and offices of clients where our associates may normally work has impacted and may continue to impact our ability to deliver services to clients our workfromhome arrangements for many of our employees may increase our exposure to security breaches or cyberattacks the ransomware attack we were subject to in april 2020 compounded the challenges we faced in enabling workfromhome arrangements and resulted in setbacks and delays to such efforts a significant worsening of the pandemic particularly in india or another security incident during the pandemic could materially impair our ability to deliver services to clients to an extent that may have a material adverse impact to our business liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

• increased costs – we face increased costs from the pandemic including as a result of mitigation efforts such as enabling increased workfromhome capabilities and additional health and safety measures 

• diversion of and strain on management and other corporate resources – addressing the significant personal and business challenges presented by the pandemic including various business continuity measures and the need to enable workfromhome arrangements for many of our associates has demanded significant management time and attention and strained other corporate resources and is expected to continue to do so among other things this may adversely impact our client and associate development and our ability to execute our strategy and various transformation initiatives 

• reduced employee morale and productivity – the significant personal and business challenges presented by a pandemic including the covid19 pandemic such as the potentially lifethreatening health risks to employees and their families and friends the closures of schools and the unavailability of various services our employees may rely upon such as childcare have been and may be a cause of employee morale concerns and may adversely impact employee productivity 

the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve the ultimate extent to which the pandemic impacts our business liquidity results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the delivery and effectiveness of vaccines future mutations of the covid19 virus and any resulting impact on the effectiveness of vaccines the duration and extent of the pandemic and waves of infection travel restrictions and social distancing the duration and extent of business closures and business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain treat and prevent the disease if we or our clients experience prolonged shutdowns or other business disruptions our business liquidity results of operations financial condition and the trading price of our common stock may be materially adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets may be limited 

if we are unable to attract train and retain skilled employees to satisfy client demand including highly skilled technical personnel and personnel with experience in key digital areas as well as senior management to lead our business globally our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of skilled employees including project managers it engineers and senior technical personnel in particular those with experience in key digital areas in balance with client demand around the world and on our ability to attract and retain senior management with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally each year we must hire tens of thousands of new employees and reskill retain and motivate our workforce of hundreds of thousands of employees with diverse skills and expertise in order to serve client demands across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technological industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business we also must continue to maintain an effective senior leadership team that among other things is effective in executing on our strategic goals and growing our digital business the loss of senior executives or the failure to attract integrate and retain new senior executives as the needs of our business require could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

competition for skilled labor is intense and in some jurisdictions and service areas in which we operate and in particular in key digital areas there are more open positions than qualified persons to fill these positions our business has experienced and may continue to experience significant employee attrition which may cause us to incur increased costs to hire new employees with the desired skills costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant if we are unable to hire or deploy employees with the needed skillsets or if we are unable to adequately equip our employees with the skills needed 

  

this could materially adversely affect our business additionally if we are unable to maintain an employee environment that is competitive and appealing it could have an adverse effect on engagement and retention which may materially adversely affect our business 

we face challenges related to growing our business organically as well as inorganically through acquisitions and we may not be able to achieve our targeted growth rates 

achievement of our targeted growth rates requires continued significant organic growth of our business as well as inorganic growth through acquisitions to achieve such growth we must among other things continue to significantly expand our global operations increase our product and service offerings in particular with respect to digital and scale our infrastructure to support such business growth continued business growth increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management employees operations systems delivery financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions which we will have to continue to develop and improve to sustain such growth we must continually recruit and train new employees retain and reskill as necessary existing sales technical finance marketing and management employees with the knowledge skills and experience that our business model requires and effectively manage our employees worldwide to support our culture values strategies and goals additionally we expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and investments to enhance our offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand our talent experience and capabilities in key digital areas or in particular geographies or industries we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities completing targeted transactions or achieving the desired results and such opportunities may divert our managements time and focus away from our core business we may face challenges in effectively integrating acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and in assimilating and retaining employees of those businesses into our culture and organizational structure if we are unable to manage our growth effectively complete acquisitions of the number magnitude and nature we have targeted or successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our targeted growth rates or improve our market share profitability or competitive position generally or in specific markets or services 

we may not be able to achieve our profitability goals and maintain our capital return strategy 

our goals for profitability and capital return rely upon a number of assumptions including our ability to improve the efficiency of our operations and make successful investments to grow and further develop our business our profitability depends on the efficiency with which we run our operations and the cost of our operations especially the compensation and benefits costs of our employees we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial costs related to implementing our strategy to optimize such costs and we may not realize the ultimate cost savings that we expect we may not be able to efficiently utilize our employees if increased regulation policy changes or administrative burdens of immigration work visas or client worksite placement prevents us from deploying our employees on a timely basis or at all to fulfill the needs of our clients increases in wages and other costs may put pressure on our profitability fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can also have adverse effects on our revenues income from operations and net income when items denominated in other currencies are translated or remeasured into us dollars for presentation of our consolidated financial statements we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts intended to partially offset the impact of the movement of the exchange rates on future operating costs and to mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign currency denominated net monetary assets however the hedging strategies that we have implemented or may in the future implement to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market operational and counterparty credit risks we are particularly susceptible to wage and cost pressures in india and the exchange rate of the indian rupee relative to the currencies of our client contracts due to the fact that the substantial majority of our employees are in india while our contracts with clients are typically in the local currency of the country where our clients are located if we are unable to improve the efficiency of our operations our operating margin may decline and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected failure to achieve our profitability goals could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

with respect to capital return our ability and decisions to pay dividends and repurchase shares depend on a variety of factors including the cash flow generated from operations our cash and investment balances our net income our overall liquidity position potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions and anticipated future economic conditions and financial results failure to maintain our capital return strategy may adversely impact our reputation with shareholders and shareholders’ perception of our business and the trading price of our common stock 

our failure to meet specified service levels or milestones required by certain of our client contracts may result in our client contracts being less profitable potential liability for penalties or damages or reputational harm 

many of our client contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreedupon performance standards or milestones failure to satisfy these requirements could significantly reduce our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments subject us to potential damage claims 

  

under the contract terms or harm our reputation the use of new technologies in our offerings can expose us to additional risks if those technologies fail to work as predicted which could lead to cost overruns project delays financial penalties or damage to our reputation clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments some of our contracts provide that a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate as such these provisions may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts and have in the past and could in the future result in significant losses on such contracts 

we face intense and evolving competition and significant technological advances that our service offerings must keep pace with in the rapidly changing markets we compete in 

the markets we serve and operate in are highly competitive subject to rapid change and characterized by a large number of participants as described in “ part i item 1 business competition” in addition to large global competitors we face competition in many geographic markets from numerous smaller local competitors that may have more experience with operations in these markets have wellestablished relationships with our desired clients or be able to provide services and solutions at lower costs or on terms more attractive to clients than we can consolidation activity may also result in new competitors with greater scale a broader footprint or vertical integration that makes them more attractive to clients as a single provider of integrated products and services in addition concurrent use by many clients of multiple professional service providers means that we are required to be continually competitive on the quality scope and pricing of our offerings or face a reduction or elimination of our business 

our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology to serve the evolving needs of our clients examples of areas of significant change include digital cloud and securityrelated offerings which are continually evolving as well as developments in areas such as ai augmented reality automation blockchain iot quantum computing and asaservice solutions if we do not sufficiently invest in new technologies successfully adapt to industry developments and changing demand and evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale to keep pace with the demands of the markets we serve we may be unable to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and execute on our growth strategy which would materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our relationships with our third party alliance partners who supply us with necessary components to the services and solutions we offer our clients are also critical to our ability to provide many of our services and solutions that address client demands there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such relationships among other things such alliance partners may in the future decide to compete with us form exclusive or more favorable arrangements with our competitors or otherwise reduce our access to their products impairing our ability to provide the services and solutions demanded by clients 

we face legal reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client andor cognizant data from security breaches andor cyberattacks 

in order to provide our services and solutions we depend on global information technology networks and systems to process transmit host and securely store electronic information including our confidential information and the confidential information of our clients and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients suppliers and partners security breaches employee malfeasance or human or technological error create risks of shutdowns or disruptions of our operations and potential unauthorized access andor disclosure of our or our clients’ sensitive data which in turn could jeopardize projects that are critical to our operations or the operations of our clients’ businesses and have other adverse impacts on our business or the business of our clients 

like other global companies we and the clients and vendors we interact with face threats to data and systems including by nation state threat actors perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks computer viruses malware worms bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate client information and cause system failures and disruptions for example in april 2020 we announced a security incident involving a maze ransomware attack the attack resulted in unauthorized access to certain data and caused significant disruption to our business 

a security compromise of our information systems or of those of businesses with which we interact that results in confidential information being accessed by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions client attrition due to reputational concerns or otherwise containment and remediation expenses and claims brought by our clients or others for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or data protection laws monetary damages imposed on us could be significant and may impose costs in excess of insurance policy limits or not be covered by our insurance at all techniques used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or 

  

sabotage systems continuously evolve and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of our information systems diverting resources from other projects and disrupting our businesses any remediation measures that we have taken or that we may undertake in the future in response to the security incident announced in april 2020 or other security threats may be insufficient to prevent future attacks 

we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the united states the united kingdom the european union and in other jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection use and transfer of personal data including the transfer of personal data between or among countries for example the european union’s general data protection regulation has imposed stringent compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data and has resulted in the issuance of significant financial penalties for noncompliance in the united states there have been proposals for federal privacy legislation and many new state privacy laws are on the horizon recently enacted legislation such as the california consumer privacy act and its successor the california privacy rights act that will go into effect on january 1 2023 impose extensive privacy requirements on organizations governing personal information existing us sectoral laws such as the health insurance portability and accountability act also impose extensive privacy and security requirements on organizations operating in the healthcare industry which we serve additionally in india the personal data protection bill 2019 continues to make progress through the indian parliament if enacted in its current form it would impose stringent obligations on the handling of personal data including certain localization requirements for sensitive data other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies or our clients pursuant to our contractual obligations relating to our compliance with these regulations complying with changing regulatory requirements requires us to incur substantial costs exposes us to potential regulatory action or litigation and may require changes to our business practices in certain jurisdictions any of which could materially adversely affect our business operations and operating results 

if our risk management business continuity and disaster recovery plans are not effective and our global delivery capabilities are impacted our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and we may suffer harm to our reputation 

our business model is dependent on our global delivery capabilities which include coordination between our delivery centers in india our other global and regional delivery centers the offices of our clients and our associates worldwide system failures outages and operational disruptions may be caused by factors outside of our control such as hostilities political unrest terrorist attacks natural disasters including events that may be caused or exacerbated by climate change and public health emergencies and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic affecting the geographies where our people equipment and clients are located for example we have substantial global delivery operations in chennai india a city that has experienced severe rains flooding and droughts in recent years and is at significant risk of increasingly severe natural disasters in future years as a result of climate change our risk management business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective at preventing or mitigating the effects of such disruptions particularly in the case of catastrophic events or longer term developments such as the impacts of climate change any such disruption may result in lost revenues a loss of clients and reputational damage which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a substantial portion of our employees in the united states united kingdom european union and other jurisdictions rely on visas to work in those areas such that any restrictions on such visas or immigration more generally or increased costs of obtaining such visas or increases in the wages we are required to pay associates on visas may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in these jurisdictions which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

a substantial portion of our employees in the united states and in many other jurisdictions including countries in europe rely upon temporary work authorization or work permits which makes our business particularly vulnerable to changes and variations in immigration laws and regulations including written changes and policy changes to the manner in which the laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced and potential enforcement actions and penalties that might cause us to lose access to such visas the political environment in the united states the united kingdom and other countries in recent years has included significant support for antiimmigrant legislation and administrative changes many of these recent changes have resulted in and various proposed changes may result in increased difficulty in obtaining timely visas that could impact our ability to staff projects including as a result of visa application rejections and delays in processing applications and significantly increased costs for us in obtaining visas or as a result of prevailing wage requirements for our associates on visas for example in the united states the prior administration adopted a number of policy changes and executive orders designed to limit immigration and the ability of immigrants to be employed including increased scrutiny of the issuance of new and the renewal of existing h1b visa applications and the placement of h1b visa workers on third party worksites i ncreases to the prevailing wage requirements that set a minimum level of compensation for visa holders and for entities where more than 50 of the workers in the united states hold h1b and l1 visas increases in the visa costs for such entities while a number of 

  

these policy changes and executive orders were stayed by the courts the current administration may continue to seek their implementation or the implementation of similar measures in the future and there continues to be political support for potential new laws and regulations that if adopted may have a material adverse impact on companies like ours that have a substantial percentage of our employees on visas our principal operating subsidiary in the united states had more than 50 of its employees on h1b or l1 visas as of december 31 2020 and as a result may be subject to increased costs if any such laws regulations policy changes or executive orders go into effect in the eu many countries continue to implement new regulations to move into compliance with the eu directive of 2014 to harmonize immigration rules for intracompany transferees in most eu member states and to facilitate the transfer of managers specialists and graduate trainees both into and within the region the changes have had significant impact on mobility programs and have led to new notification and documentation requirements for companies sending employees to eu countries recent changes or any additional adverse revisions to immigration laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may cause us delays staffing shortages additional costs or an inability to bid for or fulfill projects for clients any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

legal regulatory and legislative risks 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted and negative perceptions associated with offshore outsourcing could impair our ability to serve our clients and materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the practice of outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in the united states which is our largest market as well as other regions in which we have clients for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by us companies have been put forward for consideration by the us congress and in state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs domestically if any such measure is enacted our ability to provide services to our clients could be impaired 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about purported negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as alleged domestic job loss and theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data particularly involving service providers in india current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from utilizing global service delivery providers like us due to negative perceptions that may be associated with using global service delivery models or firms any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward global service delivery would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide the majority of their services from within the country in which our clients operate 

we are subject to numerous and evolving legal and regulatory requirements and client expectations in the many jurisdictions in which we operate and violations of unfavorable changes in or an inability to meet such requirements or expectations could harm our business 

we provide services to clients and have operations in many parts of the world and in a wide variety of different industries subjecting us to numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations on matters as diverse as import and export controls temporary work authorizations or work permits and other immigration laws content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation anticorruption laws including the fcpa and the uk bribery act the environment government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy intellectual property employment and labor relations we face significant regulatory compliance costs and risks as a result of the size and breadth of our business for example we may experience increased costs in 2021 and future years for employment and postemployment benefits in india as a result of the issuance of the code in late 2020 

we are also subject to a wide range of potential enforcement actions audits or investigations regarding our compliance with these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business and any finding of a violation could subject us to a wide range of civil or criminal penalties including fines debarment or suspension or disqualification from government contracting prohibitions or restrictions on doing business loss of clients and business legal claims by clients and damage to our reputation 

we commit significant financial and managerial resources to comply with our internal control over financial reporting requirements but we have in the past and may in the future identify material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that cause us to incur incremental remediation costs in order to maintain adequate controls as another example in recent years we had to spend significant resources on conducting an internal investigation and cooperating with investigations by the doj and the sec both concluded in 2019 focused on whether certain payments relating to companyowned facilities in india were made in violation of the fcpa and other applicable laws 

governmental bodies investors clients and businesses are increasingly focused on esg issues which has resulted and may in the future continue to result in the adoption of new laws and regulations and changing buying practices if we fail to 

  

keep pace with esg trends and developments or fail to meet the expectations of our clients and investors our reputation and business could be adversely impacted 

changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement failure by us to adapt our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements to achieve global tax efficiencies or adverse outcomes of tax audits investigations or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations and financial condition 

the interpretation of tax laws and regulations in the many jurisdictions in which we operate and the related tax accounting principles are complex and require considerable judgment to determine our income taxes and other tax liabilities worldwide tax laws and regulations affecting us and our clients including applicable tax rates and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations are subject to change as a result of economic political and other factors and any such changes or changes in tax accounting principles could increase our effective worldwide income tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our net income and financial condition we routinely review and update our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements including transfer pricing policies consistent with applicable laws and regulations to align with our evolving business operations and provide global tax efficiencies across the numerous jurisdictions such as the united states india and the united kingdom in which we operate failure to successfully adapt our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements to align with our evolving business operations and achieve global tax efficiencies may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 

the following are several examples of changes in tax laws that may impact us 

• the tax reform act was enacted in december 2017 and made a number of significant changes to the corporate tax regime in the united states the us treasury department continues to issue proposed and final regulations which modify relevant aspects of the new tax regime 

• in december 2019 the government of india enacted the india tax law effective retroactively to april 1 2019 that enables indian companies to elect to be taxed at a lower income tax rate of 2517 as compared to the current rate of 3494 once a company elects into the lower income tax rate that company may not benefit from any tax holidays associated with sezs and certain other tax incentives including mat carryforwards and may not reverse its election as of december 31 2020 we had deferred income tax assets related to the mat carryforwards of 98 million see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements our current intent is to elect into the new tax regime once our mat carryforwards are fully or substantially utilized our intent is based on a number of current assumptions and financial projections and if our intent were to change and we were to opt into the new tax regime at an earlier time the writeoff of any remaining mat deferred tax assets may materially increase our provision for income taxes and effective income tax rate and decrease our eps while the loss of the benefit of the mat carryforwards may increase our cash tax payments 

• the oecd has been working on a base erosion and profit shifting project and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change numerous longstanding tax principles the changes recommended by the oecd have been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business and could lead to disagreements among jurisdictions over the proper allocation of profits among them the oecd has also undertaken a new project focused on “addressing the tax challenges of the digitalization of the economy” this project may impact multinational businesses by implementing a global model for minimum taxation similarly the european commission and various jurisdictions have introduced proposals to or passed laws that impose a separate tax on specified digital services these recent and potential future tax law changes create uncertainty and may materially adversely impact our provision for income taxes 

our worldwide effective income tax rate may increase as a result of these recent developments changes in interpretations and assumptions made additional guidance that may be issued and ongoing and future actions the company has or may take with respect to our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements 

additionally we are subject from time to time to tax audits investigations and proceedings tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments and are taking increasingly aggressive positions including with respect to our intercompany transactions for example we are currently involved in an ongoing dispute with the itd in which the itd asserts that we owe additional taxes for two transactions by which cts india repurchased shares from its shareholders as more fully described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements adverse outcomes in any such audits investigations or proceedings could increase our tax exposure and cause us to incur increased expense which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our business subjects us to considerable potential exposure to litigation and legal claims and could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability 

we are subject to and may become a party to a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the conduct of our business our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees clients alliance partners subcontractors suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions whistleblower claims administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable 

our client engagements expose us to significant potential legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to third parties or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients for example third parties could claim that we or our clients whom we typically contractually agree to indemnify with respect to the services and solutions we provide infringe upon their ip rights any such claims of ip infringement could harm our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs in defending ourselves expose us to considerable legal liability or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future we may have to engage in legal action to protect our own ip rights and enforcing our rights may require considerable time money and oversight and existing laws in the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection 

we also face considerable potential legal liability from a variety of other sources our acquisition activities have in the past and may in the future be subject to litigation or other claims including claims from employees clients stockholders or other third parties we have also been the subject of a number of putative securities class action complaints and putative shareholder derivative complaints relating to the matters that were the subject of our now concluded internal investigation into potential violations of the fcpa and other applicable laws and may be subject to such legal actions for these or other matters in the future see  part i item 3 legal proceedings  for more information we establish reserves for these and other matters when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated however the estimation of legal reserves and possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our estimates and materially adversely affect our results of operations

business outlook 

we have four strategic priorities as we seek to increase our commercial momentum and accelerate growth these strategic priorities are 

• accelerating digital  growing our digital business organically and inorganically 

• globalizing cognizant  growing our business in key international markets and diversifying leadership capabilities and delivery footprint 

• repositioning our brand  improving our global brand recognition and becoming better known as a global digital partner to the entire csuite and 

• increasing our relevance to our clients  leading with thought leadership and capabilities to address clients business needs 

we continue to expect the longterm focus of our clients to be on their digital transformation into softwaredriven dataenabled customercentric and differentiated businesses as our clients seek to optimize the cost of supporting their legacy systems and operations our core portfolio of services may be subject to pricing pressure and lower demand due to clients transitioning certain work inhouse at the same time clients continue to adopt and integrate digital technologies and their demand for our digital operations services and solutions has only increased since the beginning of the covid19 pandemic as demand for mobile workplace solutions ecommerce automation and ai and cybersecurity services and solutions has grown 

our clients will likely continue to contend with industryspecific changes driven by evolving digital technologies uncertainty in the regulatory environment industry consolidation and convergence as well as international trade policies and other macroeconomic factors which could affect their demand for our services the covid19 pandemic ma y continue to negatively impact demand particularly among our retail consumer goods travel and hospitality clients within our products and resources segment as well as communications and media clients in our communications media and technology segment the significant and evolving nature of the covid19 pandemic makes it difficult to estimate its future impact on our ongoing business results of operations and overall financial performance see part i  item 1a risk factors  

as a global professional services company we compete on the basis of the knowledge experience insights skills and talent of our employees and the value they can provide to our clients competition for skilled labor is intense and our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of skilled employees in particular those with experience in key digital areas in balance with client demand around the world as such we will continue to focus on recruiting talent management and employee engagement to attract and retain our employees 

we will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions investments and alliances that will expand our talent experience and capabilities in key digital areas or in particular geographies or industries 

in addition our future results may be affected by immigration law changes that may impact our ability to do business or significantly increase our costs of doing busi ness potential tax law changes and other potential regulatory changes including potentially increased costs in 2021 and future years for employment and postemployment benefits in india as a result of the issuance of the code in late 20 20 as well as costs related to the potential resolution of legal a nd regulatory matters discussed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information see part i item 1a risk factors

operating margin  overall 

our operating margin and adjusted operating margin 6 decreased to 127 and 144 respectively in 2020 from 146 and 166 respectively during 2019 our gaap and adjusted operating margin 6 were adversely impacted by higher incentivebased compensation accrual rates investments intended to drive organic and inorganic revenue growth the impact of the proposed exit the decline in revenues brought on by the covid19 pandemic and the impact of the ransomware attack on both revenues and costs these impacts were partially offset by a significant decrease in travel and entertainment expenses due to the covid19 pandemic the cost savings generated as a result of the 2020 fit for growth plan lower immigration costs and the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar in addition our 2019 gaap operating margin included a 07 negative impact of the incremental accrual in 2019 related to the india defined contribution obligation as discussed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements while our 2020 gaap operating margin was negatively impacted by covid19 charges 

excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 92 basis points or 092 percentage points in 2020 while in 2019 the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 53 basis points or 053 percentage poi nts each additional 10 change in exchange rate between the indian rupee and the us dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 17 basis points or 017 percentage points 

we enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge certain indian rupee denominated payments in india these hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the indian rupee the impact of the settlement of our cash flow hedges was immaterial in 2020 and 2019 

our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our employees these costs are affected by the impact of inflation in certain regions competition for professionals with the advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation

segment operating profit and margin

to a smaller shortfall in 2020 than in 2019 of incentivebased compensation as compared to target covid19 charges and costs related to the ransomware attack partially offset by the 2019 india defined contribution obligation discussed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements 

other income expense net 

total other income expense net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses interest income and interest expense the following table sets forth total other income expense net for the years ended december 31 



the foreign currency exchange gains and losses were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of the indian rupee denominated net monetary assets and liabilities in our us dollar functional currency india subsidiaries and to a lesser extent the remeasurement of other net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries the gains and losses on our foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments related to the realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to nonus dollar denominated net monetary assets and liabilities as of december 31 2020 the notional value of our undesignated hedges was 637 million the decrease in interest income of 57 million was primarily attributable to lower yields in 2020 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 704 million in 2020 and 643 million in 2019 the effective income tax rate increased to 336 in 2020 as compared to 253 in 2019 primarily driven by the tax on accumulated indian earnings the impact of the proposed exit which was not deductible for tax purposes and the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar which resulted in nondeductible foreign currency exchange losses in our consolidated statement of operations 

income loss from equity method investments 

in 2019 we recorded an impairment charge of 57 million on one of our equity method investments as further described in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

net income 

net income was 1392 million in 2020 and 1842 million in 2019 net income as a percentage of revenues decreased to 84 in 2020 from 110 in 2019 the decrease in net income was driven by lower income from operations higher foreign currency exchange losses inclusive of losses on our foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments lower interest income and a higher provision for income taxes 

nongaap financial measures   

portions of our disclosure include nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies in addition these nongaap financial measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap the reconciliations of our nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures set forth below should be carefully evaluated 

our nongaap financial measures adjusted operating margin adjusted income from operations and adjusted diluted eps exclude unusual items additionally adjusted diluted eps excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses and the tax impact of all the applicable adjustments the income tax impact of each item is calculated by applying the 

  

statutory rate and local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred constant currency revenue growth is defined as revenues for a given period restated at the comparative period’s foreign currency exchange rates measured against the comparative periods reported revenues 

we believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the company provides enhanced transparency into our operating results for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes we use various gaap and nongaap financial measures for financial and operational decisionmaking to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons to determine portions of the compensation for our executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors therefore it is our belief that the use of nongaap financial measures excluding certain costs provides a meaningful supplemental measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance we believe that the presentation of our nongaap financial measures along with reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure as applicable can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 

a limitation of using nongaap financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap is that nongaap financial measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with gaap and may exclude costs that are recurring such as our net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses in addition other companies may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than us thereby limiting the usefulness of these nongaap financial measures as a comparative tool we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from our nongaap financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such nongaap financial measures 

the following table presents a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to the most comparable gaap measure for the years ended december 31

the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 



operating activities 

the increase in cash generated from operating activities for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by improved collections on our trade accounts receivable deferrals of certain payments due to covid19 pandemic regulatory relief provided by several jurisdictions in which we operate and lower incentivebased compensation payouts and cash taxes paid in 2020 

we monitor turnover aging and the collection of trade accounts receivable by client our dso calculation includes trade accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts and contract assets reduced by the uncollected portion of our deferred revenue dso was 70 days as of december 31 2020 and 73 days as of december 31 2019 

  

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in 2020 was primarily driven by payments for acquisitions net cash provided by investing activities in 2019 was driven by net sales of investments partially offset by payments for acquisitions and outflows for capital expenditures 

financing activities 

the de crease in cash used in financing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to lower repurchases of common stock in 2020 

we have a credit agreement providing for a 750 million term loan and a 1750 million unsecured revolving credit facility which are due to mature in november 2023 we are required under the credit agree ment to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the term loan see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements during the first quarter of 2020 we borrowed 174 billion against our revolving credit facility and repaid this amount in full in the fourth quarter of 2020 we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the credit agreement to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the remaining available capacity under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2020 and through the date of this filing as of december 31 2020 we had no outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility 

in february 2020 our india subsidiary renewed its oneyear 13 billion indian rupee 178 million at the december 31 2020 exchange rate working capital facility which requires us to repay any balances drawn down within 90 days from the date of disbursement there is a 10 prepayment penalty applicable to payments made within 30 days of disbursement this working capital facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and may be renewed annually in february as of december 31 2020 there was no balance outstanding under the working capital facility 

during 2020 we returned 2034 m illion to our stockholders throu gh 1554 million in share repurchases under our stock repurchase program and 480 million in dividend payments our stock repurchase program as amended by our board of directors in december 2020 allows for the repurchase of an aggregate of up to 95 billion excluding fees and expenses of our class a common stock as of december 31 2020 we have 28 billion excluding fees and expenses available for repurchases under the program our shares outstanding decreased to 530 million as of december 31 2020 from 548 million as of december 31 2019 we review our capital return plan on an ongoing basis considering the potential impacts of covid19 pandemic our financial performance and liquidity position investments required to execute our strategic plans and initiatives acquisition opportunities the economic outlook regulatory changes and other relevant factors as these factors may change over time the actual amounts expended on stock repurchase activity dividends and acquisitions if any during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time 

other liquidity and capital resources information 

we seek to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of our domestic and international cash flows and cash balances we evaluate on an ongoing basis what portion of the nonus cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments is needed locally to execute our strategic plans and what amount is available for repatriation back to the united states 

in march 2020 the indian parliamen t enacted the budget of india which contained a number of provisions related to income tax including a replacement of the ddt previously due from the dividend payer with a tax payable by the shareholder receiving the dividend this provision reduced the tax rate applicable to us for cash repatriated from india following this change during the first quarter of 2020 we limited our indefinite reinvestment assertion to india earnings accumulated in prior years in july 2020 the us treasury department and the irs released final regulations which became effective in september 2020 that reduced the tax applicable on our accumulated indian earnings upon repatriation as a result during the third quarter of 2020 after a thorough analysis of the impact of these changes in law on the cost of earnings repatriation and considering our strategic decision to increase our investments to accelerate growth in various international markets and expand our global delivery footprint we reversed our indefinite reinvestment assertion on indian earnings accumulated in prior years and recorded a 140 million tax on accumulated indian earnings the recorded income tax expense reflects the india withholding tax on unrepatriated indian earnings which were 52 billion as of december 31 2019 net of applicable us foreign tax credits on october 28 2020 our subsidiary in india remitted a dividend of 21 billion which resulted in a net payment of 20 billion to its shareholders nonindian cognizant entities after payment of 106 million of india withholding tax 

  

we expect our operating cash flows cash and shortterm investment balances together with our available capacity under our revolving credit facilities to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements and service our debt for the next twelve months our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans make acquisitions meet our longterm capital requirements beyond a twelvemonth period and execute our capital return plan will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to pay for acquisitions with capital stock and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we cannot be certain that additional financing if required will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all 



commitments 

as of december 31 2020 we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments 



  



1 consists of scheduled repayments of our term loan 

2 interest on the term loan was calculated at interest rates in effect as of december 31 2020 

3 other purchase commitments include among other things communications and information technology obligations as well as other obligations that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation 

as of december 31 2020 we had 193 million of unrecognized income tax benefits this represents the income tax benefits associated with certain income tax positions on our us and nonus tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution the resolution of these income tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 

contingencies 

see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 



other than our foreign exchange forward and option contracts there were no offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2020 and 2019 that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 



management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap we base our estimates on historical experience current trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared we evaluate our estimates on a continuous basis however the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements as they require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain changes to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenues related to fixedprice contracts for application development and systems integration services consulting or other technology services are recognized as the service is performed using the cost to cost method under which the total value of revenues is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor costs revenues related to fixedprice application maintenance testing and business process services are recognized using the cost to cost method if the right to invoice is not representative of the value being delivered the cost to cost method requires estimation of future costs which is updated as the project progresses to reflect the latest available information such estimates and changes in estimates involve the use of judgment the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known net changes in estimates of such future costs and contract losses were immaterial to the consolidated results of operations for the periods presented 

income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and related valuation allowance if any and liabilities requires significant judgment we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate in addition transactions between our affiliated entities are arranged in accordance with applicable transfer pricing laws regulations and relevant guidelines as a result and due to the interpretive nature of certain aspects of these laws and guidelines we have pending applications for apas before the taxing authorities in some of our most significant jurisdictions it could take years for the relevant taxing authorities to negotiate and conclude these applications the consolidated provision for income taxes may change period to period based on changes in facts and circumstances such as settlements of income tax audits or finalization of our applications for apas 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of reserves established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related interest which may require us to apply judgment to complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit to the extent that the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

business combinations goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets including indefinitelived intangible assets arise from the accounting for business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed including any contingent consideration and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation of the purchase price utilizes estimates and assumptions in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets including the timing and amount of forecasted revenues and cash flows anticipated growth rates client attrition rates and the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows 

we exercise judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units expected to benefit from each business combination goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate regulatory environment established business plans operating performance indicators or competition evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach using market multiples under the income approach we estimate projected future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and longterm growth rates and determine the appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows the discount rate used is based on a market participant weightedaverage cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected future cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenues and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on 

  

operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant our 2020 qualitative assessment included the review of relevant macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets was below carrying value 

beginning with the first quarter of 2020 covid19 negatively affected all major economic and financial markets and although there is a wide range of possible outcomes and the associated impact is highly dependent on variables that are difficult to forecast we deemed the deterioration in general economic conditions sufficient to trigger an interim impairment testing of goodwill as of march 31 2020 our interim test results as of march 31 2020 indicated that the fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and thus no impairment of goodwill existed as of march 31 2020 based on our most recent evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets performed during the fourth quarter of 2020 we concluded that the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances in each of our reporting units were not at risk of impairment 

we review our finitelived assets including our finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever eve nts or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable we recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset groups the impairment loss is determined as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value assessing the fair value of asset groups involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows 

contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated when a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable we do not record a liability but instead disclose the nature and amount of the claim and an estimate of the loss or range of loss if such an estimate can be made significant judgment is required in the determination of whether an exposure is considered probable and reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective and based on the information available from the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel as additional information becomes available we reassess any potential liability related to any pending litigation and may revise our estimates such revisions in estimates of any potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to changes in the value of certain foreign currencies all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures 

revenues from our clients in the united kingdom continental europe and rest of world represented 80 99 and 65 respectively of our 2020 revenues and are typically denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly our revenues may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates primarily the british pound and the euro as compared to the us dollar 

a significant portion of our costs in india are denominated in the indian rupee representing approximately 200 of our global operating costs during 2020 and are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india these us dollar  indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs as of december 31 2020 the notional value and weighted average contract rates of these contracts by year of maturity were as follows 



as of december 31 2020 the net unrealized gain o n our outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges was 70 million  based upon a sensitivity analysis at december 31 2020 which estimates the fair value of the contracts assuming certain market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges of approximately 224 million  

a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may result in nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement in 2020 we reported foreign currency exchange losses exclusiv e of hedging losses of approximately 53 million which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries we use foreign exchange forward contracts to provide an economic hedge against balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2021 at december 31 2020 the notional value of these outstanding contracts was 637 million and th e net unrealized gain was less than 1 million based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2020 which estimates the fair value of the contracts assuming certain market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 17 million  

interest rate risk 

we have a credit agreement providing for a 750 million unsecured term loan and a 1750 million unsecured revolving credit facility which are due to mature in november 2023 we are required under the credit agreement to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the term loan 

the credit agreement requires interest to be paid at our option at either the abr or the eurocurrency rate each as defined in the credit agreement plus in each case an applicable margin as defined in the credit agreement initially the applicable margin is 0875 with respect to eurocurrency rate loans and 000 with respect to abr loans subsequently the 

  

applicable margin with respect to eurocurrency rate loans may range from 075 to 1125 depending on our public debt ratings or if we have not received public debt ratings from 0875 to 1125 depending on our leverage ratio which is the ratio of indebtedness for borrowed money to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement under the credit agreement we are required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility which vary based on our public debt ratings or if we have not received public debt ratings on the leverage ratio thus our debt exposes us to market risk from changes in interest rates we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our interest expense a 100 change in interest rates with all other variables held constant would have an immaterial effect on our reported interest expense 

information provided by the sensitivity analysis of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk does not necessarily represent the actual changes that would occur under normal market conditions

clients 

the services we provide are distributed among a number of clients in each of our business segments revenues from our top clients as a percentage of total revenues were as follows 



a loss of a significant client or a few significant clients in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for that segment the services we provide to our larger clients are often critical to their operations and a termination of our services would typically require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues nevertheless the volume of work performed for specific clients may vary significantly from year to year 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 we announced that we will exit certain contentrelated work that is not in line with our longterm strategic vision for the company we intend to exit this work in 2020 and this may negatively impact our relationship with the affected clients and the revenues from other services we provide to them refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

we face various important risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition and as a result cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock  

our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions globally and in particular in the markets in which our clients and operations are concentrated 

global macroeconomic conditions have a significant effect on our business as well as the businesses of our clients volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions could cause our clients to reduce postpone or cancel spending on projects with us and could make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast client demand and have available the right resources to profitably address such client demand the shortterm nature of contracts in our industry means that actions by clients may occur quickly and with little warning which may cause us to incur extra costs where we have employed more professionals than client demand supports 

our business is particularly susceptible to economic and political conditions in the markets where our clients or operations are concentrated our revenues are highly dependent on clients located in the united states and europe and any adverse economic political or legal uncertainties or adverse developments including due to the uncertainty related to the potential economic and regulatory impacts of the united kingdoms exit from the european union may cause clients in these geographies to reduce their spending and materially adversely impact our business many of our clients are in the financial services and healthcare industries so any decrease in growth or significant consolidation in these industries or regulatory policies that restrict these industries may reduce demand for our services economic and political developments in india where a significant majority of our operations and technical professionals are located or in other countries where we maintain delivery operations may also have a significant impact on our business and costs of operations as a developing country india has experienced and may continue to experience high inflation and wage growth fluctuations in gross domestic product growth and volatility in currency exchange rates any of which could materially adversely affect our cost of operations additionally we benefit from governmental policies in india that encourage foreign investment and promote the ease of doing business such as tax incentives and any change in policy or circumstances that results in the elimination of such benefits or degradation of the rule of law or imposition of new adverse restrictions or costs on our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to attract train and retain skilled professionals including highly skilled technical personnel to satisfy client demand and senior management to lead our business globally our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of skilled professionals including project managers it engineers and senior technical personnel in balance with client demand around the world and on our ability to attract and retain senior management with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally each year we must hire tens of thousands of new professionals and reskill retain and motivate our workforce of hundreds of thousands of professionals with diverse skills and expertise in order to serve client demands across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technological industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business we also must continue to maintain an effective senior leadership team that among other things is effective in executing on our strategic goals and growing our digital business the loss of senior executives or the failure to attract integrate and retain new senior executives as the needs of our business require could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

competition for skilled labor is intense and in some jurisdictions in which we operate there are more jobs for it professionals than qualified persons to fill these jobs our business has experienced significant employee attrition which may cause us to incur increased costs to hire new professionals with the desired skills costs associated with recruiting and training professionals are significant if we are unable to hire or deploy professionals with the needed skillsets or if we are unable to adequately equip our professionals with the skills needed this could materially adversely affect our business additionally if we are unable to maintain an employee environment that is competitive and contemporary it could have an adverse effect on engagement and retention which may materially adversely affect our business 

  

we face challenges related to growing our business organically as well as inorganically through acquisitions and we may not be able to achieve our targeted growth rates 

achievement of our targeted growth rates requires continued significant organic growth of our business as well as inorganic growth through acquisitions to achieve such growth we must among other things continue to significantly expand our global operations increase our product and service offerings in particular with respect to digital and scale our infrastructure to support such business growth continued business growth increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions which we will have to continue to develop and improve to sustain such growth we must continually recruit and train new personnel and retain and reskill as necessary existing sales technical finance marketing and management personnel with the knowledge skills and experience that our business model requires and effectively manage our personnel worldwide to support our culture values strategies and goals additionally we expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions investments and joint ventures to enhance our offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities completing targeted transactions or achieving the desired results and such opportunities may divert our managements time and focus away from our core business we may face challenges in effectively integrating acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and in assimilating and retaining employees of those businesses into our culture and organizational structure if we are unable to manage our growth effectively complete acquisitions of the number magnitude and nature we have targeted or successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our targeted growth rates or improve our market share profitability or competitive position generally or in specific markets or services 

we may not be able to achieve our profitability and capital return goals 

our goals for profitability and capital return rely upon a number of assumptions including our ability to improve the efficiency of our operations and make successful investments to grow and further develop our business our profitability depends on the efficiency with which we run our operations and the cost of our operations especially the compensation and benefits costs of the professionals we employ we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial costs related to implementing our strategy to optimize such costs and we may not realize the ultimate cost savings that we expect we may not be able to efficiently utilize our professionals if increased regulation policy changes or administrative burdens of immigration work visas or outsourcing prevents us from deploying our professionals globally on a timely basis or at all to fulfill the needs of our clients increases in wages and other costs may put pressure on our profitability fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can also have adverse effects on our revenues income from operations and net income when items originally denominated in other currencies are translated or remeasured into us dollars for presentation of our consolidated financial statements we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts intended to partially offset the impact of the movement of the exchange rates on future operating costs and to mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign currency denominated net monetary assets however the hedging strategies that we have implemented or may in the future implement to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market operational and counterparty credit risks we are particularly susceptible to wage and cost pressures in india and the exchange rate of the indian rupee relative to the currencies of our client contracts due to the fact that the substantial majority of our employees are in india while our contracts with clients are typically in the local currency of the country where our clients are located if we are unable to improve the efficiency of our operations our operating margin may decline and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected failure to achieve our profitability goals could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

with respect to capital return our ability and decisions to pay dividends and repurchase shares consistent with our announced goals or at all depend on a variety of factors including our cash flow generated from operations the amount and geographic location of our cash and investment balances our net income our overall liquidity position potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions and anticipated future economic conditions and financial results failure to achieve our capital return goals may adversely impact our reputation with shareholders and shareholders’ perception of our business and the value of our common stock 

our failure to meet specified service levels or milestones required by certain of our client contracts may result in our client contracts being less profitable potential liability for penalties or damages or reputational harm 

many of our client contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreedupon performance standards or milestones failure to satisfy these measures could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms or harm our reputation the use of new technologies in our offerings can expose us to additional risks if those technologies fail to work as predicted or there are unintended consequences of new designs or uses which could lead to cost overruns project delays financial penalties or damage to our reputation clients also often have the right to terminate 

  

a contract and pursue damage claims for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments some of our contracts provide that a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate as such these provisions may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts 

we face intense and evolving competition and significant technological advances that our service offerings must keep pace with in the rapidly changing markets we compete in 

the markets we serve and operate in are highly competitive subject to rapid change and characterized by a large number of participants as described in “ part i item 1 businesscompetition ” in addition to large global competitors we face competition from numerous smaller local competitors in many geographic markets that may have more experience with operations in these markets have wellestablished relationships with our desired clients or be able to provide services and solutions at lower costs or on terms more attractive to clients than we can consolidation activity may also result in new competitors with greater scale a broader footprint or vertical integration that makes them more attractive to clients as a single provider of integrated products and services in addition the shortterm nature of contracts in our industry and the longterm concurrent use by many clients of multiple professional service providers means that we are required to be continually competitive on the quality scope and pricing of our offerings or face a reduction or elimination of our business 

our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology to serve the evolving needs of our clients examples of areas of significant change include digital cloud and securityrelated offerings which are continually evolving as well as developments in areas such as ai augmented reality automation blockchain iot quantum computing and asaservice solutions if we do not sufficiently invest in new technologies successfully adapt to industry developments and changing demand and evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale to keep pace with the demands of the markets we serve we may be unable to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and execute on our growth strategy which would materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our relationships with our third party alliance partners who supply us with necessary components to the services and solutions we offer our clients are also critical to our ability to provide many of our services and solutions that address client demands there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such relationships among other things such alliance partners may in the future decide to compete with us form exclusive or more favorable arrangements with our competitors or otherwise reduce our access to their products impairing our ability to provide the services and solutions demanded by clients 

we face legal reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client andor cognizant data from security breaches or cyberattacks 

in order to provide our services and solutions we depend on global information technology networks and systems including those of third parties to process transmit host and securely store electronic information including our confidential information and the confidential information of our clients and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients suppliers and partners security breaches employee malfeasance or human or technological error could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our operations and potential unauthorized disclosure of our or our clients’ sensitive data which in turn could jeopardize projects that are critical to our operations or the operations of our clients’ businesses like other global companies we and the businesses we interact with have experienced threats to data and systems including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks computer viruses malware worms bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate client information and cause system failures and disruptions 

a security compromise of our information systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact that results in confidential information being accessed by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions client attrition remediation expenses disruption of our business and claims brought by our clients or others for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or data protection laws monetary damages imposed on us could be significant and not covered by our liability insurance techniques used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems evolve frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of our information systems diverting resources from other projects and disrupting our businesses if we experience a data security breach our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation regulatory risks and business losses 

we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the united states the united kingdom the european union and in other jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection use and transfer of personal data including the transfer of personal data between or among countries for example the european union’s 

  

general data protection regulation has imposed stringent compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data and has resulted in the issuance of significant financial penalties for noncompliance in the united states there have been proposals for federal privacy legislation and many new state privacy laws are on the horizon recently enacted legislation such as the california consumer privacy act impose extensive privacy requirements on organizations governing personal information existing us sectoral laws such as the health insurance portability and accountability act also impose extensive privacy and security requirements on organizations operating in the healthcare industry which cognizant serves additionally in india the personal data protection bill 2018 was recently cleared for introduction in the current session of the indian parliament if enacted in its current form it would impose stringent obligations on the handling of personal data including certain localization requirements for sensitive data other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies or our clients pursuant to our contractual obligations relating to our compliance with these regulations complying with changing regulatory requirements requires us to incur substantial costs exposes us to potential regulatory action or litigation and may require changes to our business practices in certain jurisdictions any of which could materially adversely affect our business operations and operating results 

if our business continuity and disaster recovery plans are not effective and our global delivery capability is impacted our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and we may suffer harm to our reputation 

our business model is dependent on our global delivery capability which includes coordination between our main operating offices in india our other global and regional delivery centers the offices of our clients and our associates worldwide system failures outages and operational disruptions may be caused by factors outside of our control such as hostilities political unrest terrorist attacks natural disasters pandemics and public health emergencies such as the coronavirus affecting the geographies where our operations and transmission equipment is located our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective at preventing or mitigating the effects of such disruptions particularly in the case of a catastrophic event any such disruption may result in lost revenues a loss of clients and reputational damage which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a substantial portion of our employees in the united states united kingdom european union and other jurisdictions rely on visas to work in those areas such that any restrictions on such visas or immigration more generally or increased costs of obtaining such visas may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in these jurisdictions which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

a substantial portion of our employees in the united states and in many other jurisdictions including countries in europe rely upon temporary work authorization or work permits which makes our business particularly vulnerable to changes and variations in immigration laws and regulations including written changes and policy changes to the manner in which the laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced and potential enforcement actions and penalties that might cause us to lose access to such visas the political environment in the united states the united kingdom and other countries in recent years has included significant support for antiimmigrant legislation and administrative changes many of these recent changes have resulted in and various proposed changes may result in increased difficulty in obtaining timely visas that impact our ability to staff projects including as a result of visa application rejects and delays in processing applications and significantly increased costs for us in obtaining visas for example in the united states the current administration has implemented policy changes to increase scrutiny of the issuance of new and the renewal of existing h1b visa applications and the placement of h1b visa workers on third party worksites and has issued executive orders designed to limit immigration in addition the administration has proposed for implementation in 2020 a policy change applicable to entities where more than 50 of the workers in the united states hold certain types of visas that if implemented would significantly increase the visa costs for such entities in the eu many countries continue to implement new regulations to move into compliance with the eu directive of 2014 to harmonize immigration rules for intracompany transferees in most eu member states and to facilitate the transfer of managers specialists and graduate trainees both into and within the region the changes have had significant impacts on mobility programs and have led to new notification and documentation requirements for companies sending professionals to eu countries recent changes or any additional adverse revisions to immigration laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may cause us delays staffing shortages additional costs or an inability to bid for or fulfill projects for clients any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted and negative perceptions associated with offshore outsourcing could impair our ability to serve our clients and materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the practice of outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in the united states which is our largest market as well as other regions in which we have clients for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by us companies have been put forward for consideration by the us congress and in state 

  

legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs domestically if any such measure is enacted our ability to provide services to our clients could be impaired 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about purported negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as alleged domestic job loss and theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data particularly involving service providers in india current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from utilizing global service delivery providers like us due to negative perceptions that may be associated with using global service delivery models or firms any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward global service delivery would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide the majority of their services from within the country in which our clients operate 

we are subject to numerous and evolving legal and regulatory requirements and client expectations in the many jurisdictions in which we operate and violations of unfavorable changes in or an inability to meet such requirements or expectations could harm our business 

we provide services to clients and have operations in many parts of the world and in a wide variety of different industries subjecting us to numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations on matters as diverse as import and export controls temporary work authorizations or work permits content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation anticorruption laws including the fcpa and the uk bribery act government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy intellectual property and labor relations we are subject to a wide range of potential enforcement actions audits or investigations regarding our compliance with these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business and any finding of a violation could subject us to a wide range of civil or criminal penalties including fines debarment or suspension or disqualification from government contracting prohibitions or restrictions on doing business loss of clients and business legal claims by clients and damage to our reputation 

we face significant regulatory compliance costs and risks as a result of the size and breadth of our business for example we commit significant financial and managerial resources to comply with our internal control over financial reporting requirements but we have in the past and may in the future identify material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that causes us to incur incremental remediation costs in order to maintain adequate controls as another example we had to spend significant resources on conducting an internal investigation and cooperating with investigations by the us doj and the sec each of which is now concluded focused on whether certain payments relating to companyowned facilities in india were made in violation of the fcpa and other applicable laws 

various governmental bodies and many customers and businesses are increasingly focused on environmental and social issues which has resulted and may in the future continue to result in the adoption of new laws and regulations and changing buying practices if we fail to keep pace with these developments our reputation and business could be adversely impacted 

changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement failure by us to adapt our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements to achieve global tax efficiencies or adverse outcomes of tax audits investigations or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations and financial condition 

the interpretation of tax laws and regulations in the many jurisdictions in which we operate and the related tax accounting principles are complex and require considerable judgment to determine our income taxes and other tax liabilities worldwide tax laws and regulations affecting us and our clients including applicable tax rates and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations are subject to change as a result of economic political and other factors and any such changes or changes in tax accounting principles could increase our effective worldwide income tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition we routinely review and update our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements including transfer pricing policies consistent with applicable laws and regulations to align with our evolving business operations and provide global tax efficiencies across the numerous jurisdictions such as the united states india and the united kingdom in which we operate failure to successfully adapt our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements to align with our evolving business operations and achieve global tax efficiencies may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 

the following are several examples of changes in tax laws that may impact us 

• the tax reform act was enacted in december 2017 and made a number of significant changes to the corporate tax regime in the united states the us treasury department continues to issue proposed and final regulations which modify relevant aspects of the new tax regime 

• in december 2019 the government of india enacted the india tax law effective retroactively to april 1 2019 that enables indian companies to elect to be taxed at a lower income tax rate of 2517 as compared to the current rate 

  

of 3494 once a company elects into the lower income tax rate a company may not benefit from any tax holidays associated with sezs and certain other tax incentives including mat carryforwards and may not reverse its election as of december 31 2019 we had deferred income tax assets related to the mat carryforwards of approximately 176 million see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements our current intent is to elect into the new tax regime once our mat carryforwards are fully or substantially utilized our intent is based on a number of current assumptions and financial projections and if our intent were to change and we were to opt into the new tax regime at an earlier time the writeoff of any remaining mat deferred tax assets may materially increase our provision for income taxes and effective income tax rate and decrease our earnings per share while the loss of the benefit of the mat carryforwards may increase our cash tax payments 

• the oecd has been working on a base erosion and profit shifting project and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change numerous longstanding tax principles the changes recommended by the oecd have been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business and could lead to disagreements among jurisdictions over the proper allocation of profits among them the oecd has also undertaken a new project focused on “addressing the tax challenges of the digitalization of the economy” this project may impact multinational businesses by implementing a global model for minimum taxation similarly the european commission and various jurisdictions have introduced proposals to or passed laws that impose a separate tax on specified digital services these recent and potential future tax law changes create uncertainty and may materially adversely impact our provision for income taxes 

our worldwide effective income tax rate may increase as a result of these recent developments changes in interpretations and assumptions made additional guidance that may be issued and ongoing and future actions the company has or may take with respect to our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements 

additionally we are subject from time to time to tax audits investigations and proceedings tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments and are taking increasingly aggressive positions including with respect to our intercompany transactions for example we are currently involved in an ongoing dispute with the itd in which the itd asserts that we owe additional taxes for two transactions by which cts india repurchased shares from its shareholders as more fully described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements adverse outcomes in any such audits investigations or proceedings could increase our tax exposure and cause us to incur increased expense which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our business subjects us to considerable potential exposure to litigation and legal claims and could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability 

we are subject to and may become a party to a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the conduct of our business our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees clients alliance partners subcontractors suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions whistleblower claims administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable 

our client engagements expose us to significant potential legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to third parties or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients for example third parties could claim that we or our clients whom we typically contractually agree to indemnify with respect to the services and solutions we provide infringe upon their intellectual property rights any such claims of intellectual property infringement could harm our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs in defending ourselves expose us to considerable legal liability or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future we may have to engage in legal action to protect our own intellectual property rights and enforcing our rights may require considerable time money and oversight and existing laws in the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection 

we also face considerable potential legal liability from a variety of other sources our acquisition activities have in the past and may in the future be subject to litigation or other claims including claims from professionals clients stockholders or other third parties we have also been the subject of a number of putative securities class action complaints and putative shareholder derivative complaints relating to the matters that were the subject of our now concluded internal investigation into potential violations of the fcpa and other applicable laws and may be subject to such legal actions for these or other matters in the future see  part i item 3 legal proceedings  for more information we establish reserves for these and other matters when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated however the estimation of legal reserves and possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation 

  

and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our estimates and materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate indian accumulated undistributed earnings 

a significant portion of our accumulated earnings are held and ongoing earnings are derived from our operations in india we consider our indian accumulated undistributed earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in india see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements while we have no plans to do so we may change our intent not to repatriate such earnings factors that may lead us to change our intent include but are not limited to changes in cash estimates capital requirements outside of india discretionary transactions changes to our shareholder capital return plan and legislative developments in india and other jurisdictions for example the budget as presented by the india finance minister on february 1 2020 contains a number of proposed provisions related to tax including a replacement of the dividend distribution tax which is due from the dividend payer with a tax payable by the shareholder receiving the dividend this measure is proposed to be effective for the india financial year starting april 1 2020 we are in the process of reviewing the various tax provisions outlined in the budget and will finalize our assessment once the budget proposals are passed into law by the parliament of india a change in our intent not to repatriate indian accumulated undistributed earnings would result in a material increase to our provision for income taxes and a decrease in our net income and earnings per share in the period such decision is made

the refinement of our strategic posture also highlighted that certain contentrelated work is not in line with our strategic vision for the company this work is largely focused on determining whether certain content violates client standards  and can involve objectionable materials as part of our 2020 fit for growth plan we intend to exit this work over the course of the next year while our other contentrelated work will continue we anticipate that this decision may negatively impact our relationship with the affected clients and estimate that we may lose revenues of 225 million to 255 million on an annualized basis within our communications media and technology segment in north america we anticipate revenues will ramp down over the next one to two years and the impact on 2020 revenues is expected to be between 180 million and 200 million in the meantime we will comply with our contractual obligations and determine the best mutual path forward with the small number of affected clients

the following charts set forth revenues and revenue growth by business segment and geography for the year ended december 31 2019  



financial services revenues in our financial services segment increased in our europe region primarily due to samlink revenues while decreasing in our north america and rest of world regions as certain banking clients continue to transition the support of some of their legacy systems and operations inhouse or to captives 





  

healthcare revenues from our healthcare segment increased in our europe and rest of world regions primarily due to revenues from our life sciences clients including revenues from our acquisition of zenith revenues in our north america region were negatively impacted by mergers within the healthcare industry the establishment of an offshore captive by a large client the customer dispute and a ramp down of a client relationship in which we were a subcontractor to a third party for the purpose of delivering healthcarerelated systems implementation services to local government partially offset by growth among our life sciences clients in this region revenue growth among our life sciences clients was driven by demand for our digital operations services and solutions 

products and resources revenue growth in our products and resources segment was primarily driven by our clients adoption and integration of digital technologies and revenues from our recently completed acquisitions 

communications media and technology revenue growth in our communications media and technology segment was strongest in our north america region and was primarily driven by the demand from our technology clients for digital content services and solutions and revenues from our recently completed acquisitions as previously noted our decision to exit certain contentrelated services will affect future revenue growth in this segment 

in 2017 we began a realignment program with the objective of improving our client focus our cost structure and the efficiency and effectiveness of our delivery while continuing to drive revenue growth under our realignment program in 2019 we incurred 22 million of executive transition costs 64 million in employee separation costs  45 million in employee retention costs and  38 million in third party realignment costs we anticipate that the employee separations completed as part of our realignment program will reduce our compensation expense by approximately 140 million on an annualized basis we expect to incur 17 million of additional realignment charges related to our retention program in the first half of 2020 

on a combined basis with our 2020 fit for growth plan described above during the year ended december 31 2019 we incurred 217 million in restructuring charges reported in the caption restructuring charges in our consolidated statements of operations

during the year ended december 31 2019 we returned 2609 million to our stockholders through 2156 million in share repurchases and 453 million in dividend payments our shares outstanding decreased to 548 million as of december 31 2019 from 577 million as of december 31 2018 we review our capital return plan on an ongoing basis considering our financial performance and liquidity position investments required to execute our strategic plans and initiatives acquisition opportunities the economic outlook regulatory changes and other relevant factors as these factors may change over time the actual amounts expended on stock repurchase activity dividends and acquisitions if any during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time 

other matters 

we accrued 117 million in 2019 related to the india defined contribution obligation as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements it is possible that the indian government will review the matter and there is a substantial question as to whether the indian government will apply the supreme court’s ruling on a retroactive basis as such the ultimate amount of our obligation may be materially different from the amount accrued 

we are involved in an ongoing dispute with the itd described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements the dispute with the itd is currently pending and no final decision has been reached 





  

2020 business outlook 

in 2020 we expect growing demand from our clients for digital services as they invest to transform into dataenabled customercentric and differentiated businesses as our clients continue their efforts to optimize the cost of supporting their legacy systems and operations our core portfolio of services may be subject to pricing pressure and lower demand as clients look to transition certain work inhouse or to new or existing captives 

our clients will likely continue to contend with industryspecific changes driven by evolving digital technologies uncertainty in the regulatory environment industry consolidation and convergence as well as international trade policies and other macroeconomic factors which could affect their demand for our services client demand may also be impacted by uncertainty related to the potential economic and regulatory effects of the united kingdoms exit from the european union additionally revenue from our technology clients will be affected by our strategic decision to exit certain contentrelated work under our 2020 fit for growth plan 

we expect our 2020 financial results to be impacted by the initial cost optimization measures executed in 2019 as part of our 2020 fit for growth plan and the expected execution of additional measures under this plan in 2020 in addition our 2020 results may be impacted by uncertainty regarding regulatory changes including potential regulatory changes with respect to immigration and taxes as well as costs related to the potential resolution of legal and regulatory matters discussed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements 

during 2020 we intend to continue to invest in our digital capabilities our talent base and new service offerings across industries and geographies while increasing our investment in sales and marketing professionals to help us expand existing accounts and acquire new ones we will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe add new technologies or platforms that complement our existing services improve our overall service delivery capabilities or expand our geographic presence additionally we will continue to focus on maintaining and optimizing our core portfolio of services through efficiency tooling and automation delivery optimization protection of renewals industry alignment and geographic expansion finally through the execution of our 2020 fit for growth plan and other initiatives we will focus on operating discipline in order to appropriately manage our cost structure 



our reportable segments are 

 the services we provide are distributed among a number of clients in each of our business segments a loss of a significant client or a few significant clients in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for that segment the services we provide to our larger clients are often critical to their operations and a termination of our services would typically require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues nevertheless the volume of work performed for specific clients may vary significantly from year to year 

in 2019 we made certain changes to the internal measurement of segment operating profits see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to this change and on our business segments

north america continues to be our largest market representing 758 of total 2019 revenues and 658 of total revenue growth in 2019  revenue growth in our north america region was driven by the demand for digital content services and solutions by clients in our communications media and technology segment the adoption and integration of digital technologies by clients in our products and resources segment and revenues from recently completed acquisitions partially offset by lower revenue in our healthcare segment as described above in 2020 revenues in our north america region will be affected by our strategic decision to exit certain contentrelated services in our communications media and technology segment revenue growth in our continental europe and the united kingdom regions was driven by our life science clients and includes revenues related to our recently completed acquisitions revenue growth in our rest of world region was driven by strength in our products and resources and healthcare segments revenue growth in our north america and rest of world regions was negatively affected as certain banking clients in these regions transition the support of some of their legacy systems and operations inhouse or to captives we believe that there are opportunities for growth across all of our geographic markets 

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense 

our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries incentivebased compensation stockbased compensation expense employee benefits projectrelated immigration and travel for technical personnel subcontracting and equipment costs relating to revenues our cost of revenues increased by 81 during 2019 as compared to 2018  increasing as a percentage of revenues to 634 during the 2019 period compared to 610 in 2018  the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to an increase in costs related to our delivery personnel including employees and subcontractors as headcount growth outpaced revenue growth partially offset by lower incentivebased compensation accrual rates in 2019

our operating margin and adjusted operating margin 6 decreased to 146 and 166  respectively in 2019 from 174 and 181  respectively during 2018  the decreases in our operating margin and adjusted operating margin 6 were due to an increase in costs related to our delivery personnel including employees and subcontractors outpacing revenue growth the dilutive impact of our recently completed acquisitions contract renegotiations with recently merged healthcare clients and the customer dispute partially offset by the impact of lower incentivebased compensation accrual rates our 2019 gaap operating margin was additionally negatively impacted by the incremental accrual related to the india defined contribution obligation as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and higher realignment charges while our 2018 gaap operating margin was negatively impacted by the initial funding of the cognizant us foundation

other income expense net 

total other income expense net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses interest income and interest expense the following table sets forth total other income expense net for the years ended december 31 



the foreign currency exchange gains and losses in all the years presented were primarily attributable to the remeasurement of the indian rupee denominated net monetary assets and liabilities in our us dollar functional currency india subsidiaries and to a lesser extent the remeasurement of other net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries the gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments relate to the realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to partially offset foreign currency exposure to the euro and indian rupee and other nonus dollar denominated net monetary assets and liabilities as of december 31 2019  the notional value of our undesignated hedges was 702 million

nongaap financial measures   

portions of our disclosure include nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies in addition these nongaap financial measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap the reconciliations of our nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures set forth below should be carefully evaluated 

our nongaap financial measures adjusted operating margin adjusted income from operations and adjusted diluted eps exclude unusual items additionally adjusted diluted eps excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses and the tax impact of all the applicable adjustments the income tax impact of each item is calculated by applying the statutory rate and local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred constant currency revenue growth is defined as revenues for a given period restated at the comparative period’s foreign currency exchange rates measured against the comparative periods reported revenues 

we believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the company provides enhanced transparency into our operating results for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes we use various gaap and nongaap financial measures for financial and operational decisionmaking to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons to determine portions of the compensation for our executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors therefore it is our belief that the use of nongaap financial measures excluding certain costs provides a meaningful supplemental measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance we believe that the presentation of our nongaap financial measures adjusted income from operations adjusted operating margin adjusted diluted eps and constant currency revenue growth along with reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure as applicable can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 

a limitation of using nongaap financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap is that nongaap financial measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with gaap and may exclude costs that are recurring such as our net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses in addition other companies may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than us thereby limiting the usefulness of these nongaap financial measures as a comparative tool we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from our nongaap financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such nongaap financial measures 

  

the following table presents a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to the most comparable gaap measure for the years ended december 31 





 

the effective income tax rate related to each of our nongaap adjustments varies depending on the jurisdictions in which such income and expenses are generated and the statutory rates applicable in those jurisdictions 



  





our cash generated from operations has historically been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to grow our business in addition as of december 31 2019  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 3424 million of which 414 million was restricted and not available for use as a result of our ongoing dispute with the itd as described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements additionally as of december 31 2019  we had available capacity under our credit facilities of approximately 1932 million  

the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 



operating activities 

the decrease in cash generated from operating activities for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the decrease in income from operations and an increase in the cash taxes paid during 2019 partially offset by improved collections of trade accounts receivable in 2019 

we monitor turnover aging and the collection of trade accounts receivable by client our dso calculation includes trade accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts and contract assets reduced by the uncollected portion of our deferred revenue dso was 73 days as of december 31 2019 and 74 days as of december 31 2018  as further described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of 2019 we changed our policy with regard to the presentation of certain amounts due to customers such as discounts and rebates this change in policy had the effect of reducing our dso by two days and one day as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively 

investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities in 2019 was driven by net sales of investments partially offset by payments for acquisitions and outflows for capital expenditures net cash used in investing activities in 2018 is related to payments for acquisitions outflows for capital expenditures and net purchases of investments 

financing activities 

the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily attributable to higher repurchases of common stock in 2019 including our 600 million 2019 asr agreement 

we have a credit agreement providing for a 750 million term loan and a 1750 million unsecured revolving credit facility which are due to mature in november 2023 we are required under the credit agreement to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the term loan see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the credit agreement to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the remaining available capacity under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019 and through the date of this filing 

in september 2019 our india subsidiary entered into a 13 billion indian rupee  182 million at the december 31 2019 exchange rate working capital facility which requires us to repay any balances drawn down within 90 days from the date of disbursement as of december 31 2019 there was no balance outstanding under the working capital facility 

during 2019  we returned 2609 million to our stockholders through 2156 million in share repurchases under our stock repurchase program and 453 million in dividend payments funded primarily with the proceeds from the liquidation of our availableforsale investment portfolio and operating cash flows our shares outstanding decreased to 548 million as of december 31 2019 

  

from 577 million as of december 31 2018 in february 2020 our board of directors approved a 10 or 002 increase to our quarterly cash dividends and increased our stock repurchase program authorization from 55 billion to 75 billion excluding fees and expenses we review our capital return plan on an ongoing basis considering our financial performance and liquidity position investments required to execute our strategic plans and initiatives acquisition opportunities the economic outlook regulatory changes and other relevant factors as these factors may change over time the actual amounts expended on stock repurchase activity dividends and acquisitions if any during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time 

other liquidity and capital resources information 

we seek to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of our domestic and international cash flows and cash balances as of december 31 2019  the amount of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states was 3097 million  of which 2414 million was in india as further described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements certain shortterm investment balances in india totaling 414 million as of december 31 2019  were restricted in connection with our dispute with the itd the affected balances may continue to remain restricted and unavailable for our use while the dispute is ongoing 

we evaluate on an ongoing basis what portion of the nonus cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside india is needed locally to execute our strategic plans and what amount is available for repatriation back to the united states we consider our earnings in india to be indefinitely reinvested which is consistent with our ongoing strategy to expand our indian operations including through infrastructure investments however future events may occur such as material changes in cash estimates discretionary transactions including corporate restructurings and changes in applicable laws that may lead us to repatriate the undistributed indian earnings as of december 31 2019  the amount of unrepatriated indian earnings was approximately 5242 million  if all of our accumulated unrepatriated indian earnings were to be repatriated based on our current interpretation of india tax law we estimate that we would incur an additional income tax expense of approximately 1101 million  this estimate is subject to change based on tax legislation developments in india and other jurisdictions as well as judicial and interpretive developments of applicable tax laws 

on february 1 2020 the india finance minister presented the budget which contains a number of proposed provisions related to tax including a replacement of the dividend distribution tax which is due from the dividend payer with a tax payable by the shareholder receiving the dividend if enacted these provisions would significantly reduce the tax rate applicable to any cash we were to repatriate from india these provisions are proposed to be effective for the india financial year starting april 1 2020 we are in the process of reviewing the various tax provisions outlined in the budget and will finalize our assessment once the budget proposals are passed into law by the parliament of india 

we expect our operating cash flow cash and investment balances excluding the 414 million of india restricted assets together with our available capacity under our revolving credit facilities to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements in india and globally for the next twelve months our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans make acquisitions and form joint ventures meet our longterm capital requirements beyond a twelvemonth period and execute our capital return plan will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to pay for acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we cannot be certain that additional financing if required will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all 

  



commitments 

as of december 31 2019  we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments 



  



 

as of december 31 2019  we had 152 million of unrecognized income tax benefits this represents the income tax benefits associated with certain income tax positions on our us and nonus tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution the resolution of these income tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 

contingencies 

see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 



other than our foreign exchange forward contracts there were no offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2019 and 2018 that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 



management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap we base our estimates on historical experience current trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared we evaluate our estimates on a continuous basis however the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial statements as they require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain changes to these estimates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition  revenues related to fixedprice contracts for application development and systems integration services consulting or other technology services are recognized as the service is performed using the cost to cost method under which the total value of revenues is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor costs revenues related to fixedprice application maintenance testing and business process services are recognized using the cost to cost method if the right to invoice is not representative of the value being delivered the cost to cost method requires estimation of future costs which is updated as the project progresses to reflect the latest available information such estimates and changes in estimates involve the use of judgment the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known net changes in estimates of such future costs and contract losses were immaterial to the consolidated results of operations for the periods presented 

income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and related valuation allowance if any and liabilities requires significant judgment we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate in addition transactions between our affiliated entities are arranged in accordance with applicable transfer pricing laws regulations and relevant guidelines as a result and due to the interpretive nature of certain aspects of these laws and guidelines we have pending applications for apas before the taxing authorities in some of our most significant jurisdictions it could take years for the relevant taxing authorities to negotiate and conclude these applications the consolidated provision for income taxes may change period to period based on changes in facts and circumstances such as settlements of income tax audits or finalization of our applications for apas 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of reserves established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related interest which may require us to apply judgment to complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit to the extent that the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

business combinations goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets including indefinitelived intangible assets arise from the accounting for business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed including any contingent consideration and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation of the purchase price utilizes significant estimates in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets the significant estimates and assumptions include the timing and amount of forecasted revenues and cash flows anticipated growth rates client attrition rates the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and the determination of useful lives for finitelived assets 

we exercise judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units expected to benefit from each business combination goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate regulatory environment established business plans operating performance indicators or competition evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach using market multiples under the income approach we estimate projected future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and longterm growth rates and determine the appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows the discount rate used is based on our weightedaverage cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected future cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenues and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant our 2019 qualitative assessment included the review of relevant macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets was below carrying value 

  

based on our most recent evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets performed during the fourth quarter of 2019  we concluded that the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances in each of our reporting units were not at risk of impairment as of december 31 2019  our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances were 3979 million and 72 million  respectively 

we review our finitelived assets including our finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable we recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset groups the impairment loss is determined as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value assessing the fair value of asset groups involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows 

contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated when a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable we do not record a liability but instead disclose the nature and amount of the claim and an estimate of the loss or range of loss if such an estimate can be made significant judgment is required in the determination of whether an exposure is considered probable and reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective and based on the information available from the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel as additional information becomes available we reassess any potential liability related to any pending litigation and may revise our estimates such revisions in estimates of any potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee additionally the united kingdoms exit from the european union and its effect on the british pound may subject us to increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rate movements accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures 

revenues from our clients in the united kingdom continental europe and rest of world represented 78  101 and 63  respectively of our 2019 revenues and are typically denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates primarily the british pound and the euro as compared to the us dollar 

a significant portion of our costs in india are denominated in the indian rupee representing approximately 207 of our global operating costs during 2019  and are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india these us dollar  indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs as of december 31 2019  the notional value and weighted average contract rates of these contracts were as follows 



as of december 31 2019  the net unrealized gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was 31 million  based upon a sensitivity analysis at december 31 2019  which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of approximately 232 million  

a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may result in nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement in 2019  we reported foreign currency exchange losses exclusive of hedging gains of approximately 73 million  which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries as of december 31 2019  we had 2414 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments denominated in indian rupees based upon a sensitivity analysis a 100 change in the indian rupee exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the us dollar reported value of these balances and a corresponding nonoperating foreign currency exchange gain or loss of approximately 244 million 

we use foreign exchange forward contracts to provide an economic hedge against balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2020  at december 31 2019  the notional value of these outstanding contracts was 702 million and the net unrealized gain was 2 million  based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2019  which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 18 million  

  

interest rate risk 

we have a credit agreement providing for a 750 million unsecured term loan and a 1750 million unsecured revolving credit facility which are due to mature in november 2023 we are required under the credit agreement to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the term loan 

the credit agreement requires interest to be paid at our option at either the abr or the eurocurrency rate each as defined in the credit agreement plus in each case an applicable margin as defined in the credit agreement initially the applicable margin is 0875 with respect to eurocurrency rate loans and 000 with respect to abr loans subsequently the applicable margin with respect to eurocurrency rate loans may range from 075 to 1125 depending on our public debt ratings or if we have not received public debt ratings from 0875 to 1125 depending on our leverage ratio which is the ratio of indebtedness for borrowed money to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement under the credit agreement we are required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility which vary based on our public debt ratings or if we have not received public debt ratings on the leverage ratio thus our debt exposes us to market risk from changes in interest rates we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our interest expense a 100 change in interest rates with all other variables held constant would have an immaterial effect on our reported interest expense 

in addition our heldtomaturity investment securities are subject to market risk from changes in interest rates as of december 31 2019  the fair market value of our heldtomaturity portfolio was 287 million  as of december 31 2019  a 10 change in interest rates with all other variables held constant would have an immaterial effect on the fair market value of our heldtomaturity investment securities we typically invest in highly rated securities and our policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

we face various important risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition and as a result cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock  

our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions globally and in particular in the markets in which our customers and operations are concentrated 

global macroeconomic conditions have a significant effect on our business as well as the businesses of our customers volatile negative or uncertain economic conditions could cause our customers to reduce postpone or cancel spending on projects with us and could make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast customer demand and have available the right resources to profitably address such customer demand the shortterm nature of contracts in our industry means that actions by customers may occur quickly and with little warning which may cause us to incur extra costs where we have employed more professionals than customer demand supports 

our business is particularly susceptible to economic and political conditions in the markets where our customers or operations are concentrated our revenues are highly dependent on customers located in the united states and europe and any adverse economic political or legal uncertainties or adverse developments including due to the anticipated exit of the united kingdom from the european union as a result of the 2016 united kingdom referendum to exit the european union the brexit referendum may cause customers in these geographies to reduce their spending and materially adversely impact our business many of our customers are in the financial services and healthcare industries so any decrease in growth or significant consolidation in these industries or regulatory policies that restrict these industries may reduce demand for our services economic and political developments in india where a significant majority of our operations and technical professionals are located or in other countries where we maintain delivery operations may also have a significant impact on our business and costs of operations as a developing country india has experienced and may continue to experience high inflation and wage growth fluctuations in gross domestic product growth and volatility in currency exchange rates any of which could materially adversely affect our cost of operations additionally we benefit from governmental policies in india that encourage foreign investment and promote the ease of doing business such as tax incentives and any change in policy or circumstances that results in the elimination of such benefits or degradation of the rule of law or imposition of new adverse restrictions or costs on our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  if we are unable to attract train and retain skilled professionals including highly skilled technical personnel to satisfy customer demand and senior management to lead our business globally our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of skilled professionals including project managers it engineers and senior technical personnel in balance with customer demand around the world and on our ability to attract and retain senior management with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally each year we must hire tens of thousands of new professionals and retrain retain and motivate our workforce of hundreds of thousands of professionals with diverse skills and expertise in order to serve customer demands across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technological industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business we also must continue to maintain an effective senior leadership team the loss of senior executives or the failure to attract integrate and retain new senior executives as the needs of our business require could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

competition for skilled labor is intense and in some jurisdictions in which we operate there are more jobs for it professionals than qualified persons to fill these jobs our business has experienced significant employee attrition which may cause us to incur increased costs to hire new professionals with the desired skills costs associated with recruiting and training professionals are significant if we are unable to hire or deploy professionals with the needed skillsets or if we are unable to adequately equip our professionals with the skills needed this could materially adversely affect our business additionally if we are unable to maintain an employee environment that is competitive and contemporary it could have an adverse effect on engagement and retention which may materially adversely affect our business 

we face challenges related to growing our business organically as well as inorganically through acquisitions and we may not be able to achieve our targeted growth rates 

achievement of our targeted growth rates requires continued significant organic growth of our business as well as inorganic growth through acquisitions to achieve such growth we must among other things continue to significantly expand our global operations increase our product and service offerings and scale our infrastructure to support such business growth continued business growth increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions which we will have to continue to develop and improve to sustain such growth we must continually recruit train and retain technical finance marketing and management personnel with the knowledge skills and experience that our business model requires and effectively manage our personnel worldwide to support our culture values strategies and goals additionally we expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions investments and joint ventures to enhance our offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities completing targeted transactions or achieving the desired results and such opportunities may divert our managements time and focus away from our core business we may face challenges in effectively integrating acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and in assimilating and retaining employees of those businesses into our culture and organizational structure if we are unable to manage our growth effectively complete acquisitions of the number magnitude and nature we have targeted or successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our targeted growth rates or improve our market share profitability or competitive position generally or in specific markets or services 

  we may not be able to achieve our profitability and capital return goals 

our goals for profitability and capital return rely upon a number of assumptions including our ability to improve the efficiency of our operations and make successful investments to grow and further develop our business our profitability depends on the efficiency with which we run our operations and the cost of our operations especially the compensation and benefits costs of the professionals we employ we may not be able to efficiently utilize our professionals if increased regulation policy changes or administrative burdens of immigration work visas or outsourcing prevents us from deploying our professionals globally on a timely basis or at all to fulfill the needs of our customers wage and other cost pressures may put pressure on our profitability fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can also have adverse effects on our revenues income from operations and net income when items originally denominated in other currencies are translated or remeasured into us dollars for presentation of our consolidated financial statements we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts intended to partially offset the impact of the movement of the exchange rates on future operating costs and to mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign currency denominated net monetary assets however the hedging strategies that we have implemented or may in the future implement to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market operational and counterparty credit risks we are particularly susceptible to wage and cost pressures in india and the exchange rate of the indian rupee relative to the currencies of our customer contracts due to the fact that the substantial majority of our employees are in india while our contracts with customers are typically in the local currency of the country where our customers are located if we are unable to improve the efficiency of our operations our operating margin may decline and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected failure to achieve our profitability goals could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

with respect to capital return our ability and decisions to pay dividends and repurchase shares consistent with our announced goals or at all depend on a variety of factors including our cash flow generated from operations the amount and geographic location of our cash and investment balances our net income our overall liquidity position potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions and anticipated future economic conditions and financial results failure to achieve our capital return goals may adversely impact our reputation with shareholders and shareholders’ perception of our business and the value of our common stock 

our failure to meet specified service levels required by certain of our contracts may result in our contracts being less profitable potential liability for penalties or damages or reputational harm 

many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreedupon performance standards or milestones failure to satisfy these measures could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones delay expected payments subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms or harm our reputation customers also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments some of our contracts provide that a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as costsavings revenue enhancement benefits produced business goals attained and adherence to schedule these goals can be complex and may depend on our customers’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate as such these provisions may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts 

we face intense and evolving competition in the rapidly changing markets we compete in 

the markets we serve and operate in are highly competitive subject to rapid change and characterized by a large number of participants as described in “ part i item 1 businesscompetition ” in addition to large global competitors we face competition from numerous smaller local competitors in many geographic markets that may have more experience with operations in these markets have wellestablished relationships with our desired customers or be able to provide services and solutions at lower costs or on terms more attractive to customers than we can consolidation activity may also result in new competitors with greater scale a broader footprint or vertical integration that makes them more attractive to customers as a single provider of integrated products and services in addition the shortterm nature of contracts in our industry and the longterm concurrent use by many customers of multiple professional service providers means that we are required to be continually competitive on the quality scope and pricing of our offerings or face a reduction or elimination of our business 

our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology to serve the evolving needs of our customers if we do not sufficiently invest in new technologies successfully adapt to industry developments and changing demand and evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale to keep pace with the demands of the markets we serve we may be unable to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and execute on our growth strategy which would materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our relationships with our third party alliance partners who supply us with necessary components to the services and solutions we offer our customers are also critical to our ability to provide many of our services and solutions that address customer demands there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such relationships among other things such alliance partners may in the future decide to compete with us form exclusive or more favorable arrangements with our competitors or otherwise reduce our access to their products impairing our ability to provide the services and solutions demanded by customers 

we face legal reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect customer andor cognizant data from security breaches or cyberattacks 

in order to provide our services and solutions we depend on global information technology networks and systems including those of third parties to process transmit host and securely store electronic information including our confidential information and the confidential information of our customers and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our customers suppliers and partners security breaches employee malfeasance or human or technological error could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our operations and potential unauthorized disclosure of our or our customers’ sensitive data which in turn could jeopardize projects that are critical to our operations or the operations of our customers’ businesses like other global companies we and the businesses we interact with have experienced threats to data and systems including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks computer viruses malware worms bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information and cause system failures and disruptions 

 a security compromise of our information systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact that results in confidential information being accessed by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions customer attrition remediation expenses disruption of our business and claims brought by our customers or others for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or data protection laws monetary damages imposed on us could be significant and not covered by our liability insurance techniques used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems evolve frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures in addition a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of our information systems diverting resources from other projects and disrupting our businesses if we experience a data security breach our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation regulatory risks and business losses 

we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the united states the european union and in other jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection use and transfer of personal data including the transfer of personal data between or among countries in the united states for example the health insurance portability and accountability act imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission use and disclosure of protected health information by participants in the health care industry the european union’s general data protection regulation which became effective in may 2018 imposes new compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data and has significantly increased financial penalties for noncompliance additionally the digital information security in healthcare act is under consideration in india which proposed legislation includes significant penalties related to disclosure of healthcare data other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies or our customers pursuant to our contractual obligations relating to our compliance with these regulations complying with changing regulatory 

requirements requires us to incur substantial costs exposes us to potential regulatory action or litigation and may require changes to our business practices in certain jurisdictions any of which could materially adversely affect our business operations and operating results 

  if our business continuity and disaster recovery plans are not effective and our global delivery capability is impacted our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and we may suffer harm to our reputation 

our business model is dependent on our global delivery capability which includes coordination between our main operating offices in india our other global delivery centers the offices of our customers and our associates worldwide system failures outages and operational disruptions may be caused by factors outside of our control such as hostilities political unrest terrorist attacks natural disasters or pandemics affecting the geographies where our operations and transmission equipment is located our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective at preventing or mitigating the effects of such disruptions particularly in the case of a catastrophic event any such disruption may result in lost revenues a loss of customers and reputational damage which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a substantial portion of our employees in the united states united kingdom european union and other jurisdictions rely on visas to work in those areas such that any restrictions on such visas or immigration more generally may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to customers in these jurisdictions which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  a substantial portion of our employees in the united states and in many other jurisdictions including countries in europe rely upon temporary work authorization or work permits which makes our business particularly vulnerable to changes and variations in immigration laws and regulations including written changes and policy changes to the manner in which the laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced the political environment in the united states the united kingdom and other countries in recent years has included significant support for antiimmigrant legislation and administrative changes many of these recent changes have made it more difficult to obtain timely visas and increased the costs of obtaining visas the governments of these countries may also tighten adjudication standards for labor market tests for example in the united states the current administration has implemented policy changes to increase scrutiny of the issuance of new and the renewal of existing h1b visa applications and the placement of h1b visa workers on third party worksites and has issued executive orders designed to limit immigration recently there has been an increase in the number of visa application rejections and delays in processing such applications this has affected and may continue to affect our ability to timely obtain visas and staff projects additionally many countries in the european union eu continue to implement new regulations to move into compliance with the eu directive of 2014 to harmonize immigration rules for intracompany transferees in most eu member states and to facilitate the transfer of managers specialists and graduate trainees both into and within the region the changes have had significant impacts on mobility programs and have led to new notification and documentation requirements for companies sending professionals to eu countries recent changes or any additional adverse revisions to immigration laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may cause us delays staffing shortages additional costs or an inability to bid for or fulfill projects for customers any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  antioutsourcing legislation if adopted and negative perceptions associated with offshore outsourcing could impair our ability to serve our customers and materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the practice of outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in the united states which is our largest market as well as other regions in which we have customers for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by us companies have been put forward for consideration by the us congress and in state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs domestically if any such measure is enacted our ability to provide services to our customers could be impaired 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about purported negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as alleged domestic job loss and theft and misappropriation of sensitive customer data particularly involving service providers in india current or prospective customers may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from utilizing global service delivery providers like us due to negative perceptions that may be associated with using global service delivery models or firms any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward global service delivery would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide the majority of their services from within the country in which our customers operate 

we are subject to numerous and evolving legal and regulatory requirements in the many jurisdictions in which we operate and violations of or unfavorable changes in such requirements could harm our business 

we provide services to customers and have operations in many parts of the world and in a wide variety of different industries subjecting us to numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations on matters as diverse as import and export controls 

temporary work authorizations or work permits content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation anticorruption laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the uk bribery act government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy intellectual property and labor relations we are subject to a wide range of potential enforcement actions audits or investigations regarding our compliance with these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business and any finding of a violation could subject us to a wide range of civil or criminal penalties including fines debarment or suspension or disqualification from government contracting prohibitions or restrictions on doing business loss of customers and business legal claims by customers and damage to our reputation 

 we face significant regulatory compliance costs and risks as a result of the size and breadth of our business for example we commit significant financial and managerial resources to comply with our internal control over financial reporting requirements but we have in the past and may in the future identify material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that causes us to incur incremental remediation costs in order to maintain adequate controls as another example we had to spend significant resources on conducting an internal investigation and cooperating with investigations by the us department of justice doj and the sec each of which is now concluded focused on whether certain payments relating to companyowned facilities in india were made in violation of the fcpa and other applicable laws 

changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement failure by us to adapt our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements to achieve global tax efficiencies or adverse outcomes of tax audits investigations or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations and financial condition 

the interpretation of tax laws and regulations in the many jurisdictions in which we operate and the related tax accounting principles are complex and require considerable judgment to determine our income taxes and other tax liabilities worldwide tax laws and regulations affecting us and our customers including applicable tax rates and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations are subject to change as a result of economic political and other factors and any such changes or changes in tax accounting principles could increase our effective worldwide income tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition we routinely review and update our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements including transfer pricing policies consistent with applicable laws and regulations to align with our evolving business operations and provide global tax efficiencies across the numerous jurisdictions such as the united states india and the united kingdom in which we operate failure to successfully adapt our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements to align with our evolving business operations and achieve global tax efficiencies may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition for example the tax cuts and jobs reform act tax reform act was enacted in december 2017 and made a number of significant changes to the corporate tax regime in the united states among other things the tax reform act introduced two new minimum taxes the “base erosion antiabuse tax” which requires us corporations to make an alternative determination of taxable income without regard to tax deductions for certain payments to nonus affiliates and a tax on certain earnings of nonus subsidiaries considered to be “global intangible low taxed income” in addition the organization for economic cooperation and development recently published the base erosion and profit shifting action plans that are being adopted and implemented in various forms by countries where we do business our worldwide effective income tax rate may increase as a result of these recent developments changes in interpretations and assumptions made and additional guidance that may be issued and the successful implementation of ongoing and future actions the company has or may take with respect to our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements 

additionally we are subject from time to time to tax audits investigations and proceedings tax authorities have disagreed and may in the future disagree with our judgments and are taking increasingly aggressive positions including with respect to our intercompany transactions for example we are currently involved in an ongoing dispute with the indian income tax department itd in which the itd asserts that we owe additional taxes for two transactions by which our principal operating subsidiary in india cts india repurchased shares from its shareholders as more fully described in note 11  to the consolidated financial statements adverse outcomes in any such audits investigations or proceedings could increase our tax exposure and cause us to incur increased expense which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  our business subjects us to considerable potential exposure to litigation and legal claims and could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability 

we are subject to and may become a party to a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the conduct of our business our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees clients alliance partners subcontractors suppliers competitors shareholders government agencies or others through private actions class actions whistleblower claims administrative proceedings regulatory actions or other litigation while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable 

 our customer engagements expose us to significant potential legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to third parties or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our customers for example third parties could claim that we or our customers whom we typically contractually agree to indemnify with respect to the services and solutions we provide infringe upon their intellectual property rights any such claims of intellectual property infringement could harm our reputation cause us to incur substantial costs in defending ourselves expose us to considerable legal liability or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future we may have to engage in legal action to protect our own intellectual property rights and enforcing our rights may require considerable time money and oversight and existing laws in the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection 

 we also face considerable potential legal liability from a variety of other sources our acquisition activities have in the past and may in the future be subject to litigation or other claims including claims from professionals customers stockholders or other third parties we have also been the subject of a number of putative securities class action complaints and putative shareholder derivative complaints relating to the matters that were the subject of our now concluded internal investigation into potential violations of the fcpa and other applicable laws and may be subject to such legal actions for these or other matters in the future see  part i item 3 legal proceedings  for more information we establish reserves for these and other matters when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated however the estimation of legal reserves and possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our estimates and materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate indian accumulated undistributed earnings 

a significant portion of our accumulated earnings are held and ongoing earnings are derived from our operations in india we consider our indian accumulated undistributed earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in india while we have no plans to do so we may change our intent not to repatriate such earnings including as a result of capital requirements in other parts of our business that may necessitate such repatriation as of december 31 2018 the amount of unrepatriated indian earnings was estimated at approximately 4679 million  if all of our accumulated unrepatriated indian earnings were to be repatriated based on our current interpretation of india tax law we estimate that we would incur an additional income tax expense of approximately 980 million this estimate is subject to change based on legislative developments in india and other jurisdictions as well as judicial and interpretive developments of applicable tax laws

2018 financial results

 the following charts set forth revenues and revenue growth by business segment and geography for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2018 

 



the following factors impacted our revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 

 the following chart sets forth our gaap operating margin adjusted operating margin 3 and nongaap operating margin 3  for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2018 

the increases in our gaap operating margin adjusted operating margin 3  and nongaap operating margin 3  were attributable to our margin enhancement initiatives which targeted the optimization of our resource pyramid improvement of utilization and the containment of our corporate spend as well as the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar net of lower gains on settlement of our cash flow hedges in 2018 compared to 2017 our gaap operating margin was negatively impacted by the initial funding of the cognizant us foundation our gaap operating margin and our adjusted operating margin were both negatively impacted by the increase in amortization expense due to recent acquisitions 

in 2017 the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act tax reform act which significantly revised the us corporate income tax law for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 as a result of this enactment in 2017 we recorded a onetime provisional net income tax expense of 617 million during 2018 we recognized a 5 million reduction to the provision for income taxes as we finalized our calculation of this onetime net income tax expense bringing the onetime cost to 612 million our effective income tax rate for 2018 was 250 as compared to 434 in 2017 the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2018 was primarily driven by the onetime net income tax expense of 617 million that was recorded in 2017 as a result of the enactment of the tax reform act and the reduction of the us federal statutory corporate income tax rate in 2018 from 35 to 21

we are involved in an ongoing dispute with the indian income tax department itd in connection with which we received a notice in march 2018 asserting that the itd is owed additional taxes on our previously disclosed 2016 india cash remittance which was the transaction undertaken by our principal operating subsidiary in india cts india to repurchase shares from its shareholders which are nonindian cognizant entities valued at 28 billion as a result of that transaction undertaken pursuant to a plan approved by the madras high court in chennai india we previously paid 135 million in indian income taxes which we believe are all the applicable taxes owed for this transaction under indian law the itd is asserting that we owe an additional 33 billion indian rupees 475 million at the december 31 2018 exchange rate related to the 2016 india cash remittance in addition to the dispute on the 2016 india cash remittance we are involved in another ongoing dispute with the itd relating to a 2013 transaction undertaken by cts india to repurchase shares from its shareholders valued at 523 million the two disputes collectively referred to as the itd dispute for which we also believe we have paid all applicable taxes owed accordingly we have not recorded any reserves for these matters as of december 31 2018 the itd dispute is currently pending before the madras high court and no final decision has been reached while we believe that we have paid all applicable taxes related to the transactions underlying the itd dispute if it is ultimately determined that we are liable for the full amount of additional taxes the itd alleges we owe there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

  

in march 2018 the itd placed an attachment on certain of our india bank accounts relating to the 2016 india cash remittance in april 2018 the madras high court granted our application for a stay of the actions of the itd and lifted the itd’s attachment of our bank accounts as part of the interim stay order we have deposited 5 billion indian rupees 71 million at the december 31 2018 exchange rate representing 15 of the disputed tax amount related to the 2016 india cash remittance with the itd this amount is presented in other current assets on our consolidated statement of financial position in addition the court has placed a lien on certain time deposits of cts india in the amount of 28 billion indian rupees 404 million at the december 31 2018 exchange rate which is the remainder of the disputed tax amount related to the 2016 india cash remittance the affected time deposits are considered restricted assets and we have reported them in “shortterm investments” on our consolidated statement of financial position as of december 31 2018 the restricted time deposits balance was 423 million  including accumulated interest 

in february 2019 we completed our internal investigation focused on whether certain payments relating to companyowned facilities in india were made improperly and in violation of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other applicable laws the investigation was conducted under the oversight of the audit committee with the assistance of outside counsel during the year ended december 31 2016 we recorded outofperiod corrections related to 4 million of potentially improper payments between 2009 and 2016 that had been previously capitalized when they should have been expensed these outofperiod corrections were not material to any previously issued financial statements there were no adjustments recorded during 2018 or 2017 related to the amounts then under investigation 

on february 15 2019 we announced a resolution of the previously disclosed investigations by the us department of justice doj and the us securities and exchange commission sec into the matters that were the subject of our internal investigation the resolution required the company to pay approximately 28 million to the doj and sec an amount consistent with the company’s accrual fcpa accrual recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2018 

during the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 we incurred 16 million not including the fcpa accrual 36 million and 27 million respectively in costs related to the above investigations and the legal matters described in note 15  to our consolidated financial statements we expect to continue to incur legal fees and other expenses including indemnification and expense advancement obligations related to stockholder litigation and other legal proceedings pertaining to the matters that were the focus of the now completed fcpa investigations described above 

2019 business considerations 

during 2019  barring any unforeseen events we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results 



 in response to this environment we plan to 





our reportable segments are 

 our chief operating decision maker evaluates the company’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating segments may affect revenues and operating expenses to differing degrees 

we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for that segment however the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and we believe that a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues 

see note 19  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our business segments 



the following table sets forth certain financial data for the three years ended december 31 2018  



 

 revenues  overall

revenues  geographic locations 

revenues by geographic market as determined by customer location were as follows 



 

   

north america continues to be our largest market representing 762  of total 2018  revenues and 641  of total revenue growth in 2018  revenues from our customers in europe grew 183  or 152  on a constant currency 4  basis specifically revenues from our rest of europe customers increased 252  or 222  on a constant currency 4  basis while within the united kingdom we experienced an increase in revenues of 108  or 76  on a constant currency 4  basis revenues from our rest of world customers was 34  or 61  on a constant currency 4  basis revenue growth in the united kingdom and rest of world was negatively affected by weakness in our financial services segment as certain banking customers in those regions focus on optimizing the cost of supporting their legacy systems and operations including moving a portion of their services to captives as they shift their spend to transformation and digital services we believe that europe india middle east asia pacific and latin america regions will continue to be areas of significant investment for us as we see these regions as long term growth opportunities 

in 2017 north america represented 773 of total revenues and 683 of total revenue growth in 2017 the increase in revenues in this region was primarily attributed to services related to the integration of digital technologies that are reshaping our customers business and operating models to align with shifts in consumer preferences increased customer spending on discretionary projects and continued interest in using our global delivery model as a means to reduce overall technology and operations costs in 2017 revenue growth in europe and rest of world markets was driven by an increase in demand for an expanded range of services such as business process services and customer adoption and integration of digital technologies revenues from our customers in europe grew 118 or 130 on a constant currency 4  basis specifically revenues from our rest of europe customers increased 288 or 268 on a constant currency 4  basis while within the united kingdom we experienced a decrease in revenues of 22 or an increase of 16 on a constant currency 4  basis revenue growth in the united kingdom was negatively affected by weakness in the banking sector in that country in 2017 revenues from our rest of world customers grew 209 primarily driven by the australia and india markets 

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense 

our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries incentivebased compensation stockbased compensation expense employee benefits projectrelated immigration and travel for technical personnel and subcontracting costs relating to revenues our cost of revenues increased by 75  during 2018  as compared to an increase of 129 during 2017  decreasing as a percentage of revenue to 610 during 2018 compared to 618 in 2017 in 2018  the decrease in cost of revenues was due primarily to a decrease as a percentage of revenues in compensation and benefits costs due to the optimization of our resource pyramid improved utilization and the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar partially offset by an increase in fees paid to strategic partners and other vendors in our digital operations platform and infrastructure services and increases in certain professional service costs in 2017  cost of revenues increased as a percentage of revenue to 618 as compared to 601 in 2016 primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits costs and an increase in certain professional services costs 

 



selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries incentivebased compensation stockbased compensation expense employee benefits immigration travel marketing communications management finance administrative and occupancy costs selling general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization increased by 97  during 2018  as compared to an increase of 28 during 2017  selling general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization remained relatively flat as a percentage of revenues at 216  in 2018  as compared to 215 in 2017  and decreased from 229 in 2016  in 2018  selling general and administrative expense included the initial funding of the cognizant us foundation and the fcpa accrual collectively representing 08 of revenues this was partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefit costs due to our efforts to contain corporate spend in 2017  the decrease as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to a decrease in compensation and benefit costs and a decrease in immigration expense partially offset by increases in certain operating and professional service costs and increases in depreciation and amortization due to acquisitions   

income from operations and operating margin  overall   

the following charts set forth our gaap operating margin adjusted operating margin 5 and nongaap operating margin 5  for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 

the increases in our gaap operating margin adjusted operating margin 5  and nongaap operating margin 5  were attributable to our margin enhancement initiatives which targeted the optimization of our resource pyramid improvement of utilization and the containment of our corporate spend as well as the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar net of lower gains on settlement of our cash flow hedges in 2018 compared to 2017 in 2018 our gaap operating margin was negatively impacted by the impact of the initial funding of the cognizant us foundation further our gaap operating margin and our adjusted operating margin for 2018 were both negatively impacted by the increase in amortization expense due to recent acquisitions 

excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 89  basis points or 089  percentage points in 2018  while in 2017  the appreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately 58 basis points or 058 percentage points each additional 10 change in exchange rate between the indian rupee and the us dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 18  basis points or 018  percentage points 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain indian rupee denominated payments in india these hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the indian rupee during the year ended december 31 2018  the settlement of cash flow hedges positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 44 basis points or 044 percentage points as compared to a positive impact of approximately 87 basis points or 087 percentage points in 2017 and a positive impact of approximately 13 basis points or 013 percentage points in 2016 

 



our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our employees in certain regions competition for professionals with the advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation as with other service providers in our industry we must adequately anticipate wage increases particularly on our fixedprice and transaction or volumebased priced contracts historically we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs in india however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs the mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future 

we finished the year with approximately 281600  employees which is an increase of approximately 21600  over the prior year end for the three months ended december 31 2018  annualized turnover including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 189  turnover for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 208 196 and 160 respectively the higher than usual annual turnover rate in 2018 reflects the highly competitive labor market in our industry in the geographies in which we compete for talent including india annual attrition rates at onsite customer locations are generally below our global attrition rate in addition attrition is weighted more towards the junior members of our staff 

segment operating profit and margin 

in 2018 we made changes to the internal measurement of segment operating profits for the purpose of evaluating segment performance and resource allocation the primary reason for the changes was to charge to our business segments costs that are directly managed and controlled by them specifically segment operating profit now includes the stockbased compensation expense of sales managers account executives account managers and project teams which was previously included in unallocated costs in addition we have changed the methodology of allocating costs to our business segments for the use of our global delivery centers and infrastructure from a fixed per employee charge to a variable per employee charge that differs depending on location and assets deployed 

segment operating profit and margin were as follows 



 

 in 2018 our financial services segment operating margin decreased due to investments in our digital platform and infrastructure services as well as costs incurred to reskill service delivery personnel partially offset by the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar in our healthcare products and resources and communications media and technology segments operating margins remained relatively flat 

in 2017 prior to giving effect to the changes in the measurement of our segment operating profit as described above our operating margins for our financial services healthcare products and resources and communications media and technology segments were 290 306 286 and 302 respectively our financial services products and resources and communications media and technology segments operating margins decreased due to increases in compensation and benefits costs investments to accelerate our shift to digital including reskilling of service delivery personnel and the negative impact of the appreciation of various currencies including the indian rupee against the us dollar our financial services segment’s operating profit was negatively impacted by weakness in the banking sector as certain customers focused on optimizing their cost 

structure and managing their discretionary spending in 2017 our healthcare segment operating margin increased benefiting from lower losses on certain fixedprice contracts with customers 

other income expense net 

total other income expense net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses interest income and interest expense the following table sets forth total other income expense net for the years ended december 31 



the foreign currency exchange gains and losses in all the years presented were primarily attributable to the remeasurement of the indian rupee denominated net monetary assets and liabilities in our us dollar functional currency india subsidiaries and to a lesser extent the remeasurement of other net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries the gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments relate to the realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to partially offset foreign currency exposure to the british pound euro indian rupee and other nonus dollar denominated net monetary assets and liabilities as of december 31 2018  the notional value of our undesignated hedges was 507 million  the increases in interest income in 2018  and 2017  were primarily attributed to increases in average invested balances and higher yields 

provision for income taxes   

the provision for income taxes was 698 million  in 2018  1153 million in 2017  and 805 million in 2016  the effective income tax rate decreased to 250  in 2018  from 434 in 2017  and 342 in 2016  the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2018 was primarily driven by the onetime net income tax expense of 617 million that was recorded in 2017 as a result of the enactment of the tax reform act and the reduction of the us federal statutory corporate income tax rate in 2018 from 35 to 21 in 2016 we incurred an incremental income tax expense of 238 million related to the india cash remittance 

net income   

net income was 2101 million  in 2018  1504 million in 2017  and 1553 million in 2016  net income as a percentage of revenues increased to 130  in 2018  from 102 in 2017  primarily due to the decrease in the provision for income taxes and an increase in income from operations partially offset by the fluctuation in the value of the indian rupee which generated foreign currency exchange losses in 2018 compared to foreign currency exchange gains in 2017 in 2017  net income as a percentage of revenues decreased to 102 from 115 in 2016  primarily due to the incremental income tax expense related to the tax reform act in 2017 

nongaap financial measures   

portions of our disclosure include nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies in addition these nongaap financial measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap the reconciliations of our nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures set forth in the following table should be carefully evaluated 

in 2018 we announced a plan to modify our nongaap financial measures our historical nongaap financial measures nongaap operating margin nongaap income from operations and nongaap diluted eps excluded stockbased compensation expense acquisitionrelated charges and unusual items such as realignment charges and in 2018 the initial funding of the cognizant 

us foundation our nongaap diluted eps additionally excluded net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses and unusual items such as the effect of the net income tax expense and benefit related to the enactment of the tax reform act in 2018 and 2017 respectively the effect of the recognition of an income tax benefit previously unrecognized in our consolidated financial statements related to a specific uncertain tax position in 2017 the effect of an incremental income tax expense related to the india cash remittance in 2016 and the tax impacts of all applicable adjustments our new nongaap financial measures adjusted operating margin and adjusted income from operations exclude only unusual items and adjusted diluted eps additionally excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses and the tax impact of all applicable adjustments the income tax impact of each item is calculated by applying the statutory rate and local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred additionally we are introducing two new nongaap financial measures free cash flow and constant currency revenue growth free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities net of purchases of property and equipment constant currency revenue growth is defined as revenues for a given period restated at the comparative period’s foreign currency exchange rates measured against the comparative periods reported revenues 

we believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the company provides enhanced transparency into our operating results for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes we use various gaap and nongaap financial measures for financial and operational decisionmaking to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons to determine portions of the compensation for our executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors therefore it is our belief that the use of nongaap financial measures excluding certain costs provides a meaningful supplemental measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance we believe that changing our historical nongaap financial measures as discussed above will result in nongaap financial measures that more closely align with how we intend to manage the company we believe that the presentation of our new nongaap financial measures adjusted income from operations adjusted operating margin adjusted diluted eps free cash flow and constant currency revenue growth as well as our historical nongaap financial measures nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted eps along with reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure as applicable can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 

a limitation of using nongaap financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap is that nongaap financial measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with gaap and may exclude costs that are recurring namely stockbased compensation expense certain acquisitionrelated charges and net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses in addition other companies may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than us thereby limiting the usefulness of these nongaap financial measures as a comparative tool we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from our nongaap financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such nongaap financial measures 

the following table presents a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to the most comparable gaap measure for the years ended december 31 



 

 

 

the effective income tax rate related to each of our nongaap adjustments varies depending on the jurisdictions in which such income and expenses are generated and the statutory rates applicable in those jurisdictions 





our cash generated from operations has historically been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to grow our business in addition as of december 31 2018  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 4511  million of which 423 million  was restricted and not available for use as a result of our dispute with the itd with respect to our 2016 india cash remittance see note 11  of our consolidated financial statements for more information as of december 31 2018 we had available capacity under our revolving credit facility of approximately 1750 million  

the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the three years ended december 31 



operating activities 

the increase in cash generated from operating activities for 2018  compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to the increase in income from operations offset by a higher days sales outstanding dso our dso was 75 days as of december 31 2018  71 days as of december 31 2017 and 72 days as of december 31 2016 the increase in cash generated from operating activities for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to the increase in pretax earnings 

we monitor turnover aging and the collection of accounts receivable by customer on january 1 2018 we adopted the new revenue standard using the modified retrospective method upon adoption we reclassified i balances representing receivables 

as defined by the new revenue standard from unbilled accounts receivable to trade accounts receivable net and ii balances representing contract assets as defined by the new revenue standard from unbilled accounts receivable to other current assets balances as of december 31 2018 are presented under the new revenue standard while prior period balances are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policies see note 3  of our consolidated financial statements for more information 

 historically our dso calculation included billed and unbilled accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts reduced by the uncollected portion of our deferred revenue to reflect the adoption of the new revenue standard and maintain the comparability of the calculation in 2018 we adjusted the definition to include receivables as defined by the new revenue standard net of allowance for doubtful accounts and contract assets reduced by the uncollected portion of our deferred revenue 

investing activities 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2018  compared to 2017 is primarily related to an increase in cash used for acquisitions in 2017  the decrease in net cash used when compared to 2016  was primarily due to lower net purchases of investments and a decrease in cash used for acquisitions 

financing activities 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2018  compared to 2017  is primarily attributable to lower repurchases of common stock partially offset by an increase in dividend payments and higher net repayments of debt in 2017 the increase in cash used when compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to repurchases of common stock under the accelerated stock repurchase agreements and dividend payments partially offset by lower net repayments of debt 

in 2014 we entered into a credit agreement with a commercial bank syndicate as amended the credit agreement providing for a 1000 million unsecured term loan and a 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility which were due to mature in november 2019 in november 2018 we completed a debt refinancing in which we entered into a credit agreement with a new commercial bank syndicate the new credit agreement providing for a 750 million unsecured term loan the new term loan and a 1750 million unsecured revolving credit facility which are due to mature in november 2023 we are required under the new credit agreement to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the new term loan beginning in december 2019 

the new credit agreement requires interest to be paid at our option at either the abr or the eurocurrency rate each as defined in the new credit agreement plus in each case an applicable margin as defined in the new credit agreement initially the applicable margin is 0875 with respect to eurocurrency rate loans and 000 with respect to abr loans subsequently the applicable margin with respect to eurocurrency rate loans may range from 075 to 1125 depending on our public debt ratings or if we have not received public debt ratings from 0875 to 1125 depending on our leverage ratio which is the ratio of indebtedness for borrowed money to consolidated ebitda as defined in the new credit agreement under the new credit agreement we are required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility which vary based on our public debt ratings or if we have not received public debt ratings on the leverage ratio 

the new credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as a financial covenant the financial covenant is tested at the end of each fiscal quarter and requires us to maintain a leverage ratio not in excess of 350 to 100 or for a period of up to four quarters following certain material acquisitions 375 to 100 we were in compliance with all debt covenants and representations of the new credit agreement as of december 31 2018 we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the new credit agreement to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the remaining available capacity under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2018 and through the date of this filing 

as part of our capital return plan we returned 37 billion to our stockholders through 2975 million in share repurchases and 733 million in dividend payments over the two years ended december 31 2018 exceeding our previously announced target of 34 billion beginning in 2019 our new capital return plan anticipates the deployment of approximately 50 of our global free cash flow 6  for dividends and share repurchases and approximately 25 of global free cash flow 6  for acquisitions as needed for the year ended december 31 2018 our cash flows from operating activities were 2592 million while our global free cash flow 6  was 2215 million we review our capital return plan on an ongoing basis considering our financial performance and liquidity position investments required to execute our strategic plans and initiatives acquisition opportunities the economic outlook regulatory changes and other relevant factors as these factors may change over time the actual amounts expended on stock repurchase activity dividends and acquisitions if any during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time 

other liquidity and capital resources information 

 we seek to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of our domestic and international cash flows and cash balances as of december 31 2018 the amount of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states was 2704 million  of which 1776 million  was in india as further described in note 11  of our consolidated financial statements 423 million  of our shortterm investment balances held in india were classified as restricted as of december 31 2018 

as a result of the enactment of the tax reform act our historical and future foreign earnings are no longer subject to us federal income tax upon repatriation beyond the onetime transition tax accrued in 2017 as such in 2018 we reevaluated our assertion that our foreign earnings would be indefinitely reinvested and concluded that our indian earnings will continue to be indefinitely reinvested while historical accumulated undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries other than our indian subsidiaries are available for repatriation to the united states we evaluate on an ongoing basis what portion of the nonus cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside india is needed locally to execute our strategic plans and what amount is available for repatriation back to the united states during 2018 we repatriated 2414 million from our foreign subsidiaries 

our assertion that our earnings in india continue to be indefinitely reinvested is consistent with our ongoing strategy to expand our indian operations including through infrastructure investments however future events may occur such as material changes in cash estimates discretionary transactions including corporate restructurings and changes in applicable laws that may lead us to repatriate the undistributed indian earnings as of december 31 2018 the amount of unrepatriated indian earnings was approximately 4679 million  if all of our accumulated unrepatriated indian earnings were to be repatriated based on our current interpretation of india tax law we estimate that we would incur an additional income tax expense of approximately 980 million this estimate is subject to change based on tax legislation developments in india and other jurisdictions as well as judicial and interpretive developments of applicable tax laws 

we expect our operating cash flow cash and investment balances excluding the 423 million  of india restricted assets together with our available capacity under our revolving credit facility to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements in india and globally for the next twelve months our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans make acquisitions and form joint ventures meet our longterm capital requirements beyond a twelvemonth period and execute our capital return plan will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to pay for acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we cannot be certain that additional financing if required will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all 

as further described in note 11  of our consolidated financial statements certain shortterm investment balances in india totaling 423 million  were restricted in connection with our dispute with the itd with respect to our 2016 india cash remittance the itd dispute is currently pending before the madras high court and no final decision has been reached the affected balances may continue to remain restricted and unavailable for our use while the dispute is ongoing 

 





commitments 

as of december 31 2018  we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments 



  

 

the above table does not include the 28 million fcpa accrual see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2018  we had 117 million  of unrecognized tax benefits this represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our us and nonus tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution the resolution of these income tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 

contingencies 

see note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 



other than our foreign exchange forward contracts there were no offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2018  2017  and 2016  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 



management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap we base our estimates on historical experience current trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared we evaluate our estimates on a continuous basis however the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial statements as they require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain changes to these estimates could have a material adverse 

effect on our results of operations and financial condition our significant accounting policies are described in note 1  of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenues related to fixedprice contracts for application development and systems integration services consulting or other technology services are recognized as the service is performed using the cost to cost method under which the total value of revenues is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor costs revenues related to fixedprice application maintenance testing and business process services are recognized using the cost to cost method if the right to invoice is not representative of the value being delivered the cost to cost method requires estimation of future costs which is updated as the project progresses to reflect the latest available information such estimates and changes in estimates involve the use of judgment the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known and any anticipated losses on contracts are recognized immediately changes in estimates of such future costs and contract losses were immaterial to the consolidated results of operations for the periods presented 

further we include in the transaction price variable consideration only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenues recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price may involve judgment and are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available to us our estimates of variable consideration were immaterial to the consolidated results of operations for the periods presented 

income taxes  determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and related valuation allowance if any and liabilities requires significant judgment we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate in addition transactions between our affiliated entities are arranged in accordance with applicable transfer pricing laws regulations and relevant guidelines as a result and due to the interpretive nature of certain aspects of these laws and guidelines we have pending before the taxing authorities in some of our most significant jurisdictions applications for advance pricing agreements apas it could take years for the relevant taxing authorities to negotiate and conclude these applications the consolidated provision for income taxes may change period to period based on changes in facts and circumstances such as settlements of income tax audits or finalization of our applications for apas 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of reserves established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related interest which may require us to apply judgment to complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit to the extent that the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

business combinations goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets including indefinitelived intangible assets arise from the accounting for business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed including any contingent consideration and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation of the purchase price utilizes significant estimates in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets the significant estimates and assumptions include the timing and amount of forecasted revenues and cash flows anticipated growth rates customer attrition rates the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and the determination of useful lives for finitelived assets 

we exercise judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units expected to benefit from each business combination goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate regulatory environment established business plans operating performance indicators or competition evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit to better align our annual goodwill impairment assessment with the timing of our budget process we elected to change the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessment from december 31 st  to october 31 st  

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach using market multiples under the income approach we estimate projected future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and long term growth rates and determine the appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows the discount rate used is based on our weightedaverage cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s 

ability to execute on the projected future cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenues and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant our 2018  qualitative assessment included the review of relevant macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets was below carrying value 

based on our most recent evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets performed during the fourth quarter of 2018 we concluded the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances in each of our reporting units were not at risk of impairment as of december 31 2018  our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances were 3481 million  and 72 million  respectively 

we review our finitelived assets including our finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable we recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such assets the impairment loss is determined as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset assessing the fair value of assets involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows 

contingencies  loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated when a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable we do not record a liability but instead disclose the nature and amount of the claim and an estimate of the loss or range of loss if such an estimate can be made significant judgment is required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective and based on the information available from the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel as additional information becomes available we reassess any potential liability related to any pending litigation and may revise our estimates such revisions in estimates of any potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee additionally the brexit referendum and its effect on the british pound may subject us to increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rate movements accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures 

revenues from our customers in the united kingdom rest of europe and rest of world represented 79  97  and 62  respectively of our 2018  revenues and are typically denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates primarily the indian rupee the british pound and the euro as compared to the us dollar 

a significant portion of our costs in india are denominated in the indian rupee representing approximately 215  of our global operating costs during 2018  and are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india these us dollar  indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs as of december 31 2018  the notional value and weighted average contract rates of these contracts were as follows 



as of december 31 2018  the net unrealized loss on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was 4 million  based upon a sensitivity analysis at december 31 2018  which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of approximately 207 million  

a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may result in nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement in 2018  we reported foreign currency exchange losses exclusive of hedging gains of approximately 183  million which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries as of december 31 2018 we had 1782 million in cash cash equivalents and investments denominated in indian rupees based upon a sensitivity analysis a 100 change in the indian rupee exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the us dollar reported value of these balances and a corresponding nonoperating foreign currency exchange gain or loss of approximately 180 million 

we use foreign exchange forward contracts to provide an economic hedge against balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2019  at december 31 2018  the notional value of these outstanding contracts was 507 million  and the net unrealized loss was 3 million  based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2018  which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 45 million  

interest rate risk 

in 2014 we entered into a credit agreement providing for a 1000 million unsecured term loan and a 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility which were due to mature in november 2019 in november 2018 we completed a debt refinancing in which we entered into the new credit agreement providing for the new term loan and a 1750 million unsecured revolving credit facility which are due to mature in november 2023 as of december 31 2018  we have 750 million  outstanding under our new term loan and no outstanding notes under the revolving credit facility 

the new credit agreement requires interest to be paid at our option at either the abr or the eurocurrency rate each as defined in the new credit agreement plus in each case an applicable margin as defined in the new credit agreement initially the applicable margin is 0875 with respect to eurocurrency rate loans and 000 with respect to abr loans subsequently the applicable margin with respect to eurocurrency rate loans may range from 075 to 1125 depending on our public debt ratings or if we have not received public debt ratings from 0875 to 1125 depending on our leverage ratio which is the ratio of indebtedness for borrowed money to consolidated ebitda as defined in the new credit agreement under the new credit agreement we are required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility which vary based on our public debt ratings or if we have not received public debt ratings on the leverage ratio thus our debt exposes us to market risk from changes in interest rates we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our interest expense a 100 change in interest rates with all other variables held constant would have an immaterial effect on our reported interest expense 

in addition our availableforsale and heldtomaturity fixed income securities are subject to market risk from changes in interest rates as of december 31 2018  the fair market values of our availableforsale and heldtomaturity portfolios were 1760 million  and 1070 million  respectively as of december 31 2018  a 10 change in interest rates with all other variables held constant would have an immaterial effect on the fair market value of our availableforsale and heldtomaturity investment securities we typically invest in highly rated securities and our policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one 

issuer our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss we may sell our availableforsale investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes in anticipation of credit deterioration or for duration management our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of time deposits mutual funds invested in fixed income securities indian rupee denominated commercial paper indian rupee denominated international corporate bonds and government debt securities us dollar denominated corporate bonds municipal bonds certificates of deposit commercial paper debt issuances by the us government us government agencies foreign governments and supranational entities and assetbacked securities the assetbacked securities included securities backed by auto loans credit card receivables and other receivables

customers 

the number of customers we serve has increased in recent years as of december 31 2017  we increased the number of our strategic customers to 357  we define a strategic customer as one offering the potential to generate at least 5 million to 50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment however no individual customer exceeded 10 of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services generally would require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a significant customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year revenues from our top customers as a percentage of total revenues were as follows 



for the year ended december 31 2017  the distribution of our revenues across geographies was as follows

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

we face various important risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition and as a result cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock  

risks relating to our business 

we face intense competition from other service providers 

the markets for technology digital and outsourcing services are highly competitive characterized by a large number of participants and subject to rapid change various competitors in all or some of such markets include 

 these markets also include numerous smaller local competitors in the various geographic markets in which we operate or intend to operate which may have more experience with operations in these markets or be able to provide services and solutions at lower costs or on terms more attractive to customers than we can additionally these companies may have longstanding or wellestablished relationships with desired customers which may put us at a competitive disadvantage our direct competitors include among others accenture atos capgemini deloitte digital dxc technology epam systems genpact hcl technologies ibm global services infosys technologies tata consultancy services and wipro in certain markets our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources and name recognition and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals some of our competitors may be more successful than us at capturing the increasing customer demand for digital services increased competition in any of the various market segments in which we compete may put downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services and in turn on our operating margins similarly if our competitors develop and implement processes and methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices without adversely affecting their profit margins if we are unable to provide our customers with superior services and solutions at competitive prices or successfully market those services to current and prospective customers our business results of operations and financial condition may suffer 

we may also face competition from companies that increase in size or scope as the result of strategic mergers or acquisitions these transactions may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers software companies and vendors and service providers which could result in the convergence of products and services if buyers of products and services in the markets we serve favor using a single provider of integrated products and services such buyers may direct more business to such providers which could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and in turn adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to increase our operating margin or our operating margin may decline and we may not be able to improve or sustain our profitability 

we have announced a margin improvement plan to increase gradually our nongaap operating margins over the next two years this plan is reliant upon a number of assumptions including our ability to improve the efficiency of our operations focus on highermargin business reduce costs and make successful investments to grow and further develop our business there can be no assurances that we will be successful in achieving this plan and other factors beyond our control including the various other risks described herein may prevent us from achieving the targeted improvements further our operating margin may decline if we experience declines in demand and pricing for our services an increase in our operating costs including due to an imposition of new nonincome related taxes or change in law or regulations related to immigration or outsourcing or adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates wages in india have historically increased at a faster rate than in the united states which has in the past and may in the future put pressure on our operating margins additionally the number and type of equitybased compensation awards and the assumptions used in valuing equitybased compensation awards may change in a manner that results in increased stockbased compensation expense and lower margins 

our operating margin and therefore our profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to recover for our services if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our operating margin and our profitability could suffer in addition if we are not able to maintain an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals our profitability may suffer if we are unable to control our costs and operate our business in an efficient manner our operating margin and therefore our profitability may decline 

we face legal reputational and financial risks from security breaches or disclosure of sensitive data or failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit host and securely store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our customers suppliers and partners security breaches employee malfeasance or human or technological error could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our operations and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data which in turn could jeopardize projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses the theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our or our customers’ confidential information or other proprietary business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce marketplace acceptance of our services any failure in the networks or computer systems used by us or our customers could result in a claim for substantial damages against us and significant reputational harm regardless of our responsibility for the failure 

in addition as a global service provider with customers in a broad range of industries we often have access to or are required to manage utilize collect and store sensitive data subject to various regulatory regimes including but not limited to us federal and state laws governing the protection of personal financial and health and the european union directive on data protection to be superseded by the european unions general data protection regulation in may 2018 if unauthorized access to or disclosure of such data in our possession or control occurs or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations in this regard we could be exposed to civil or criminal enforcement actions and penalties in connection with any violation of applicable data protection laws as well as lawsuits brought by our customers our customers’ customers their clients or others for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or data protection laws laws and expectations relating to data protections continue to evolve in ways that may limit our access use and disclosure of sensitive data and may require increased expenditures by us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services 

we may be the target of significant cybersecurity attacks in the future these risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloudbased offerings and services store and process increasingly large amounts of our customers’ data and host or manage parts of our customers’ businesses especially in industries involving particularly sensitive data such as the financial services and healthcare industries 

our revenues and operating results may experience significant quarterly fluctuations 

we may experience significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations among the factors that could cause these variations are 



as a result of these or other factors it is possible that in some future periods our revenues and results of operations may be significantly below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such an event the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 

our business results of operations and financial condition will suffer if we fail to enhance our existing services and solutions and to develop new services and solutions that allow us to keep pace with rapidly evolving technological developments including the demand for digital technologies and services 

the markets for technology digital and outsourcing services are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions we are currently in the midst of a shift towards increasing customer demand for digital technologies and services our future success will depend on our ability to develop digital and other services and solutions that keep pace with changes in the markets in which we operate we cannot be sure that we will be successful in developing digital and other new services and solutions addressing evolving technologies in a timely or costeffective manner or that any services and solutions we do develop will be successful in the marketplace our failure to address the demands of the rapidly evolving technological environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain and attract customers and on our competitive position which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business results of operations and financial condition may be affected by the rate of growth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of technology spending by our customers 

our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our customers and prospective customers as well as their customers and suppliers in challenging economic environments our customers may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities or may choose to use their own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm to perform the types of services and solutions we provide in addition many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information and they may be unwilling or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel processes and infrastructures if the growth of technology usage in business or our customers’ spending on technology declines or if we cannot convince our customers or potential customers to embrace new technological solutions our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

most of our contracts with our customers are shortterm and our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if our customers terminate their contracts on short notice 

consistent with industry practice most of our contracts with our customers are shortterm a majority of our contracts can be terminated by our customers with short notice and without significant early termination cost terminations may occur as a result of among other things any failure on our part to satisfy our contractual commitments or more broadly satisfy our customers’ expectations with respect to the services we provide our customers may also decide at any time to switch to a different provider or undertake the work themselves due to cost or other considerations terminations may also result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project including the business or financial condition of a customer changes in ownership management or the strategy of a customer or economic or market conditions generally or specific to a customer’s industry when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to eliminate our associated costs in a timely manner consequently our operating margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected if we are unable to replace the lost revenues with other work on terms we find acceptable or effectively eliminate costs our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our customers utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions we predominantly contract to provide services either on a timeandmaterials basis a fixedprice basis or volume basis our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations and utilizing workforces with different skill sets and competencies across geographically diverse service locations our pricing cost and operating margin estimates for the work that we perform frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract there is a risk particularly for our fixedprice and transaction or volumebased priced contracts that we will underprice our projects fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work 

including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the outcome of the internal investigation being conducted under the oversight of our audit committee of possible violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar laws and related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business annual and interim results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

the company is conducting an internal investigation focused on whether certain payments relating to companyowned facilities in india were made improperly and in possible violation of the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and other applicable laws the investigation is also examining various other payments made in small amounts in india that may not have complied with company policy or applicable law in september 2016 we voluntarily notified the department of justice or doj and the securities and exchange commission or sec and are cooperating fully with both agencies the investigation is being conducted under the oversight of the audit committee with the assistance of outside counsel 

in 2016 there were putative securities class action complaints filed naming us and certain of our current and former officers as defendants and alleging violations of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act based on allegedly false or misleading statements related to potential violations of the fcpa our business prospects and operations and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures additionally in 2017 and 2016 putative shareholder derivative complaints were filed naming us certain of our directors and certain of our current and former officers as defendants see the section titled  part i item 3 legal proceedings  

the outcome of the putative class action litigation derivative lawsuit or any other litigation is necessarily uncertain we could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of these lawsuits or future ones and we may not prevail the imposition of any sanctions remedial measures or judgments against us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to maintain appropriate internal controls we may not be able to report our financial results accurately which may adversely affect our stock price and our business 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations require our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we have committed and will be required to continue to commit significant financial and managerial resources in order to comply with these requirements as described in  item 9a  controls and procedures  during the closing process for the third quarter of 2016 we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which we remediated as of december 31 2017 other material weaknesses significant deficiencies or deficiencies may develop or be identified in the future 

further we are required to integrate any acquired businesses into our system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting companies we acquire prior to being acquired by us may not be required to implement or maintain the disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are required of public companies we cannot provide assurance as to how long the integration process may take 

internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error and the possibility that controls could be circumvented or be inadequate because of changed conditions or fraud if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls we may not have adequate accurate or timely financial information and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company or comply with the requirements of the sec or the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 this could result in a restatement of our financial statements the imposition of sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information any such consequence or other negative effect resulting from our inability to meet our reporting requirements or comply with legal and regulatory requirements as well as any disclosure of an accounting reporting or control issue could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our business 

we may not be able to successfully acquire target companies or integrate acquired companies or technologies into our company and we may become subject to certain liabilities assumed or incurred in connection with our acquisitions that could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to complete acquisitions of the number magnitude and nature we have targeted or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services the process of acquiring and integrating a company business or technology has created and will continue to create operating difficulties the risks we face include 

 although we conduct due diligence in connection with each of our acquisitions there may be liabilities that are not properly disclosed to us that we fail to discover or that we inadequately or incorrectly assess in particular to the extent that any acquired business failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations failed to fulfill contractual obligations to customers or incurred material liabilities or obligations to customers that are not identified during the diligence process we as the successor owner may be financially responsible for these violations failures and liabilities and may suffer financial andor reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected in addition as part of an acquisition we may assume responsibilities and obligations of the acquired business pursuant to the terms and conditions of agreements entered into by the acquired entity that are not consistent with the terms and conditions that we typically accept and require we also have been and may in the future be subject to litigation or other claims in connection with an acquired business including claims from employees customers stockholders or other third parties any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

system failures system outages or operational disruptions in our communications or information technology systems and infrastructure could negatively impact our operations and ability to provide our services and solutions which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

to deliver our services and solutions to our customers we rely upon high speed networks including satellite fiber optic and land lines operated by third parties to provide active voice and data communications 24 hours per day between our main operating offices in india our other global delivery centers the offices of our customers and our associates worldwide any systems failure or outage or a significant disruption in such communications or in our information technology systems and infrastructure could result in curtailed operations a loss of customers and reputational damage which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business results of operations and financial condition could be impaired if we lose key members of our management team 

our future performance depends upon the continued service of the key members of our management team competition for experienced executive officers and other key employees in the industries in which we compete is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain key persons or that we will be successful in attracting and retaining replacements in the future the loss of any one or more of our executive officers or significant employees or the failure to attract integrate and retain additional talent could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or significant employees 

in addition our business could be harmed if any key member of our management team leaves our employment and joins one of our competitors currently we have entered into noncompetition agreements with most of our executive officers we cannot be certain however that the restrictions in these agreements prohibiting such executive officers from engaging in competitive activities would be enforceable 

competition for highlyskilled technical personnel is intense and our ability to compete for and manage customer engagements depends on our ability to attract and retain such personnel 

our ability to maintain and renew existing customer engagements and obtain new business depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highlyskilled technical personnel so as to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with customer demand in particular in order to serve customer needs and grow our business we must attract train and retain appropriate numbers of talented people including project managers it engineers and other senior technical personnel who are able to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences we cannot guarantee that we will be able to train and assimilate new employees successfully in addition we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for professionals with the advanced technological skills we require especially in the area of digital technologies and services we have subcontracted in the past and may continue to subcontract in the future with other service providers in order to meet our obligations to our customers if we are unable to attract and retain highlyskilled technical personnel in the numbers and locations and with the advanced technological skills we require our ability to effectively execute upon our current projects including the provision of digital technologies and services and to develop new business could be jeopardized and our business results of operations and financial condition adversely affected 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our services and solutions 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our customers we could be subject to legal liability if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide services and solutions and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the enforceable terms of our agreements we might face significant legal liability and our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain customer engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify customers or other parties with whom we conduct business with respect to certain matters these arrangements can include provisions whereby we agree to provide indemnification with respect to thirdparty claims including matters such as our breach of certain representations or covenants our infringement of the intellectual property of others our violation of laws or our gross negligence or willful misconduct payments by us under any of these arrangements are generally conditioned on the customer making a claim and providing us with full control over the defense and settlement of such claim it is not possible to determine our maximum potential exposure under these arrangements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement if events arise requiring us to make payment for indemnification claims under our contractual indemnification obligations such payments could have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally our customers may perform audits or require us to perform audits and provide audit reports with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such customers especially when we process data belonging to them our ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion in a timely manner with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit we could also incur liability if our controls and procedures or the controls and procedures we manage for a customer were to result in an internal control failure or impair our customer’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements 

we increasingly provide complex services and solutions for our customers and if we do not satisfy customer expectations or if customers cancel their engagements with us our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

the increased breadth of our service and solution offerings has resulted and may continue to result in larger and more complex projects with our customers this requires us to establish closer relationships with our customers and achieve a thorough understanding of their operations our ability to establish such relationships depends on a number of factors including the proficiency of our professionals and our management personnel our failure to understand our customer requirements or our failure to deliver services and solutions that meet the requirements specified by our customers could result in termination of customer contracts and potential liability for significant penalties or damages any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

larger projects often involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a customer may choose not to retain us for later stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements such cancellations or delays make it difficult to plan for project resource requirements and inaccuracies in such resource planning and allocation may have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to collect from our customers for our work our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our customers for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our customers and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our customers we maintain allowances against trade accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable actual losses on customer balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our customers including limited access to the credit markets insolvency or bankruptcy and as a result could cause customers to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of customer balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted fees if we do work for a customer but are nevertheless unable to meet our contractual commitments we may not be entitled to collect for our work or may collect reduced amounts andor experience delays in collection any delay or inability to collect from our customers for our work may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we rely on third parties for certain software products 

certain of our software products contain components that are developed by third parties in addition we resell certain software products of third parties and we use thirdparty software products to deliver our services and solutions we may not be able to replace the functions provided by these thirdparty software components or products if they become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or with our services and solutions or if they are not adequately maintained or updated any defects in or significant interruption in the availability of these thirdparty software products or components could harm the sale of our products and our delivery of services and solutions to our customers unless and until we can secure or develop an alternative source if we fail to comply with the license terms applicable to third party software we could be liable to the owners of the software for damages in addition thirdparty suppliers of software or other intellectual property assets could be unwilling to permit us to use or to continue to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by our customers and us if our ability to provide services and solutions to our customers is impaired as a result of any such denial our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

alternate sources for the technologies currently licensed to us may not be available to us in a timely manner may not provide us with the same functions as currently provided or may be more expensive further our success depends on our ability to maintain our existing relationships with thirdparty software providers and build new relationships with other providers in order to enhance our services and remain competitive if we are unable to maintain such existing relationships and successfully build new relationships our business results of operations and financial condition could suffer   

we are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment and derivatives portfolios 

any deterioration of the credit and capital markets in the united states europe or other regions of the world could result in volatility of our investment earnings and impairments to our investment portfolio which could negatively impact our financial condition and reported income changes in economic conditions could adversely affect the ability of counterparties including counterparties to our foreign exchange forward contracts to meet their obligations to us 

our revenues are highly dependent on customers concentrated in certain industries including the financial services and healthcare industries consolidation and factors that negatively affect these industries may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

during the year ended december 31 2017  we earned 381  of our revenues from our financial services business segment which includes banking and insurance customers and 288  from our healthcare business segment which includes healthcare and life sciences customers significant consolidation or a decrease in growth in the financial services industry or the healthcare industry may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example two or more of our current customers may merge or consolidate and combine their operations which may cause us to lose work or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies may also increase competitive and pricing pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in addition if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing regulatory economic and political conditions affecting the industries in which we operate we may be unable to effectively plan for or respond to those changes and our business results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected 

our revenues are highly dependent on customers located in the united states and europe any weakening of economic conditions in these markets may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 during the year ended december 31 2017  773  of our revenues were derived from customers located in north america and 162  of our revenues were derived from customers located in europe any weakening of economic conditions in the us or european economies could depress the pricing for our services and cause our customers to reduce or postpone their technology spending which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we do not continue to improve our operational financial and other internal controls and systems to manage our growth and size our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our historic and anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls in particular our growth has presented and will continue to present challenges with respect to 



 in addition the increasing size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that a member of our personnel will engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity breach our contractual obligations or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train our people and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock in accordance with our announced intent or at all 

in february 2017 we announced a plan to return 34 billion to stockholders by the end of 2018 through a combination of stock repurchases and cash dividends as part of this plan we have undertaken accelerated stock repurchase programs to repurchase a total of 18 billion of our class a common stock and paid 265 million for dividends in 2017 following the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act or the tax reform act and due in part to the benefits we expect to receive under such act in february 2018 we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend and have indicated that our board of directors intends to continue to review the capital return plan for potential future increases subject to our financial performance economic outlook and any other relevant considerations 

the board of directors’ determinations regarding dividends and share repurchases will depend on a variety of factors including amount and location of our cash and investment balances net income cash flow generated from operations overall liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results there can be no guarantee that we will achieve our announced capital return plan in the amounts or within the expected time frame that we have indicated or at all our ability to declare future dividends will depend on our future financial performance which in turn depends on the successful implementation of our strategy and on financial competitive regulatory technical and other factors general economic conditions demand and prices for our services and other factors specific to our industry or specific projects many of which are beyond our control therefore our ability to generate cash flow depends on the performance of our operations and could be limited by decreases in our profitability or increases in costs regulatory changes capital expenditures or debt servicing requirements 

any failure to achieve our announced capital return plan could negatively impact our reputation harm investor confidence in us and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

risks relating to our international operations 

our global operations are subject to complex risks some of which might be beyond our control 

we have offices and operations in various countries around the world and provide services to customers globally in 2017  773  of our revenues were attributable to the north american region 162  were attributable to the european region and the remainder was attributable to the rest of the world primarily asia pacific we anticipate that revenues from customers outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence 

we may be subject to risks inherently associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations difficulties in enforcing intellectual property andor contractual rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable international hostilities terrorism and natural disasters we may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india and we are subject to regulatory economic political and other uncertainties in india 

we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india where a majority of our technical professionals are located while wage costs are lower in india than in the united states and other developed countries for comparably skilled professionals wages in india have historically increased at a faster rate than in the united states and other 

countries in which we operate if this trend continues in the future it would result in increased costs for our skilled professionals and thereby potentially reduce our operating margins also there is no assurance that in future periods competition for skilled professionals will not drive salaries higher in india thereby resulting in increased costs for our technical professionals and reduced operating margins 

in the past the indian economy has experienced many of the problems that commonly confront the economies of developing countries including high inflation erratic gross domestic product growth and volatility in currency exchange rates the indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy and indian government actions concerning the economy could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities like us in the past the indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy including the software development services industry changes in government leadership in india or a change in policies of the existing government in india that results in the elimination of any of the benefits realized by us from our indian operations or the imposition of new taxes applicable to such operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the indian rupee and other foreign currency exchange rates restrictions on the deployment of cash across our global operations and our use of derivative financial instruments 

although we report our operating results in us dollars a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues income from operations net income and the value of balance sheet items originally denominated in other currencies there is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations in addition in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which could limit our ability to use these funds across our global operations further as we leverage our global delivery model a portion of our expenses is incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee against the us dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain rupee denominated payments in india these contracts are intended to partially offset the impact of the movement of the exchange rates on future operating costs in addition we have also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign currency denominated net monetary assets the hedging strategies that we have implemented or may in the future implement to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market operational and counterparty credit risks accordingly we may incur losses from our use of derivative financial instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violations of these regulations could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

because we provide services to customers throughout the world we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal rules on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations violations of these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business damage to our reputation and other unintended consequences such as liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

among other anticorruption laws and regulations we are subject to the fcpa which prohibits improper payments or offers of improper payments to foreign officials to obtain business or any other benefit and the uk bribery act violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions including fines and suspension or disqualification from government contracting or contracting with private entities in certain highly regulated industries any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

international hostilities terrorist activities other violence or war natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could delay or reduce the number of new service orders we receive and impair our ability to service our customers thereby adversely affecting our business results of operations and financial condition 

hostilities involving acts of terrorism violence or war natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat or perceived potential for these events could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to provide services to our customers such events may cause customers to delay their decisions on spending for information technology consulting and business process services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our personnel and to our and our customers’ physical facilities and operations around the world additionally by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to some or all of our customers the majority of our employees are located in india and the majority of our technical professionals in the united states and europe are indian nationals who are able to work in the united states and europe only because they hold currently valid visas and work permits any inability to travel could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs and expenses or could impair our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities could also adversely affect our ability to serve our customers 

hostilities involving the united states the united kingdom india and other countries in which we provide services to our customers as well as acts of terrorism violence or war natural disasters global health risks or pandemics may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our customers our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the results of the united kingdom’s referendum on withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

in march 2017 prime minister theresa may of the united kingdom formally began the process of withdrawing the united kingdom from the european union following the june 2016 referendum in which a majority of voters in the united kingdom supported the withdrawal or the brexit referendum the terms of the withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last until march 2019 the brexit referendum and the ensuing process of the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union has created political and economic uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union and as to whether any other european countries may similarly seek to exit the european union if the united kingdom and the european union are unable to negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other european union member states pursue withdrawal barrierfree access between the united kingdom and other european union member states or among the european economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated as we have material operations in both the united kingdom and the rest of europe and our global operations serve many customers with significant operations in those regions our financial condition and results of operation may be impacted by such uncertainty 

for the year ended december 31 2017 revenues from our customers in the united kingdom and rest of europe represented 78  and 84  respectively of our consolidated revenues a significant portion of our revenues from customers in the united kingdom is generated in british pounds this exposure subjects us to revenue risk with respect to our customers in the united kingdom as well as to risk resulting from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates in addition for the year ended december 31 2017 revenues from our financial services customers represented 381  of our consolidated revenues uncertainty regarding future united kingdom financial laws and regulations the withdrawal terms of the united kingdom from the european union and the future trade terms between the united kingdom and the european union could negatively impact the financial services sector including our customers in such sector and as a consequence adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations further it is uncertain what impact the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union will have on general economic conditions in the united kingdom the european union and globally any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to intellectual property 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our software products and other solutions data proprietary methodologies and other valuable ip we presently hold a limited number of issued patents and we have filed and intend to continue to file patent applications there is no guarantee that any patents will be issued in the united states or in any other country where we may seek protection or that they will serve as a barrier from competition from other organizations 

additionally the protection afforded by international patent laws as well as the enforcement actions differ from country to country there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain adequate protection or enforcement of our ip rights 

we also rely upon a combination of copyright trademark and trade secret laws nondisclosure and related contractual arrangements and other security measures to protect our ip rights we believe that laws rules regulations and treaties in effect in the united states india and most other countries in which we operate are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our ip however there can be no assurance that these laws will not change in ways that may prevent or restrict our ability or make it more expensive to continue to protect the software data and methodologies we use in the performance of our services or that we license to our clients the existing laws of some countries in which we provide services such as china might offer only limited protection of our ip rights there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our ip rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation that we will be able to detect unauthorized use of our ip or that we will be able to maintain adequate protection or enforcement of our ip rights 

unauthorized use of our ip may result in development of software products or services that compete with our products and services and unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products services or proprietary information if we are unable to protect our ip our business may be adversely affected and our ability to compete may be impaired 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific customer greater rights in ip developed or used in connection with a contract than we normally do in certain situations we forego the right to reuse new ip we create for a customer which limits our ability to reuse that ip for other customers any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

our ability to enforce our software license agreements service agreements and other ip rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries to the extent that we seek to enforce our rights we could be subject to claims that an ip right is invalid otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are pursuing a claim in addition our assertion of ip rights may result in the other party seeking to assert alleged ip rights or assert other claims against us which could harm our business if we are not successful in defending such claims in litigation we may not be able to sell or license a particular service or solution due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations in addition governments may adopt regulations or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others or governments may require that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our ip rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the ip rights of others and we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty ip rights 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our customers do not infringe on the ip rights of others third parties may assert claims against us or our customers alleging infringement of patent copyright trademark or other intellectual property rights to solutions or services that are important to our business infringement claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions in our contracts we generally agree to indemnify our customers for certain expenses or liabilities resulting from potential infringement of the ip rights of third parties in some instances the amount of our liability under these indemnities could be substantial any claims that products services or processes we deliver infringe the intellectual property rights of others regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims may result in significant costs in defending and resolving such claims and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business in addition as a result of such ip infringement claims we could be required or otherwise decide that it is appropriate to 

 the occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets which would reduce the value of our assets and increase expenses in addition if we alter or discontinue our offering of affected items or services our revenues could be affected if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our customers an injunction might be ordered against our customer or our own services or operations causing further damages 

we expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our competitors are able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights for software products and methods technological solutions and processes we may be subject 

to ip infringement claims from certain individuals or companies that have acquired patent portfolios for the primary purpose of asserting such claims against other companies the risk of infringement claims against us may also increase as we continue to develop and license our ip to our customers and other third parties any infringement claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating to legislation and government regulation 

restrictions on immigration may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to customers which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline 

our future success continues to depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills including those from developing countries especially india the ability of foreign nationals to work in the united states europe asia pacific and other regions in which we have customers depends on their and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits for our personnel who need to travel internationally if we are unable to obtain such visas or work permits or if their issuance is delayed or if their length is shortened we may not be able to provide services to our customers or to continue to provide services on a timely and costeffective basis receive revenues as early as expected or manage our delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the countries in which we have customers are subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement for example the us congress has been actively considering various proposals that would make extensive changes to us immigration laws regarding the admission of highskilled temporary and permanent workers further the current us administration or congress may seek to limit the admission of highskilled temporary and permanent workers and has issued and may continue to issue executive orders designed to limit immigration any such provisions may increase our cost of doing business in the united states and may discourage customers from seeking our services our international expansion strategy and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted and negative perceptions associated with offshore outsourcing could impair our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the practice of outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in the united states which is our largest market as well as other regions in which we have customers for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by us companies have been put forward for consideration by the us congress and in state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs domestically further the current us administration or congress may seek to limit outsourcing by us companies if enacted such measures may broaden existing restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly or impact private industry with measures that include tax disincentives fees or penalties intellectual property transfer restrictions mandatory government audit requirements and new standards that have the effect of restricting the use of certain business andor work visas in the event that any of these measures become law our ability to provide services to our customers could be impaired which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition existing and future legislative and administrativeregulatory policies restricting the performance of business process services from an offshore location could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as domestic job loss and theft and misappropriation of sensitive customer data particularly involving service providers in india current or prospective customers may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from utilizing global service delivery providers due to negative perceptions that may be associated with using global service delivery models or firms any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward global service delivery would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide the majority of their services from within the country in which our customers operate 

 increased regulation of the financial services industry healthcare industry or other industries in which our customers operate could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

the industries in which our customers are concentrated such as the financial services industry and the healthcare industry are or may be increasingly subject to governmental regulation and intervention for instance the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a provider of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by a number of regulatory agencies these agencies regulate the services we provide and the manner in which we operate for example some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required our business may be harmed in addition customers in the financial services sector have been subject to increased regulation following the enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in the united states new or changing regulations under doddfrank as well as other regulations or legislation affecting our customers in the financial services industry may reduce demand for our services or cause us to incur costly changes in our processes or personnel thereby negatively affecting our business results of operations and financial condition 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the federal state and local levels and is subject to changing legislative regulatory political and other influences particularly in light of uncertainties posed by the result of the recent presidential election in the united states many healthcare laws such as the affordable care act are complex subject to frequent change and dependent on interpretation and enforcement decisions from government agencies with broad discretion the application of these laws to us our customers or the specific services and relationships we have with our customers is not always clear our failure to anticipate accurately any changes to or the repeal of the affordable care act and similar or future laws and regulations or our failure to comply with them could create liability for us result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition further the growth of our business results of operations and financial condition rely in part on customers in the healthcare industry that receive substantial revenues from governmental and other thirdparty payer programs a reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs a change in allocation methodologies or the termination of our customers’ government contracts could negatively affect our customers’ businesses and in turn negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition in addition as a service provider to customers who are government contractors we may in the future become involved in governmental investigations to evaluate our or our customers’ compliance with government healthcare programs which could result in the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased regulation changes in existing regulation or increased government intervention in the other industries in which our customers operate also may adversely affect the growth of their respective businesses and therefore negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating to taxes 

our earnings and financial condition may be negatively impacted by certain tax related matters 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in accounting principles or interpretations and changes in tax laws in addition our income tax returns are subject to examination in the jurisdictions in which we operate we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these examinations may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in december 2017 the united states enacted the tax reform act the onetime provisional incremental income tax expense recorded in 2017 related to the tax reform act reflects certain assumptions based upon our interpretation of the tax reform act as of january 18 2018 and may change possibly materially as we receive additional clarification and guidance and as the interpretation of the tax reform act evolves over time such changes could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods 

our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate indian accumulated undistributed earnings 

we earn a significant amount of our earnings in india and consider indian accumulated undistributed earnings to be indefinitely reinvested while we have no plans to do so events may occur that could effectively force us to change our intent not to repatriate such earnings as a result of the tax reform act us federal taxes have been provisionally accrued on these earnings as well as other nonus earnings as of december 31 2017 as part of the onetime transition tax however if we were to change our assertion that our accumulated undistributed indian earnings are indefinitely reinvested we would expect based on our current interpretation of indian tax law to accrue additional tax expense at a rate of approximately 21 of cash available for distribution which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition this estimate is subject to change based on tax legislative developments in india and other jurisdictions as well as judicial and interpretive developments of applicable tax laws 

our earnings may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided by india to companies in our industry as well as by possible changes in indian tax laws 

our indian subsidiaries collectively referred to as cognizant india are primarily exportoriented and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the indian government for export activities conducted within special economic zones or sezs for periods of up to 15 years the indian government has announced a plan to phase out certain tax exemptions and deductions which includes a discontinuation of tax holidays for new sez units commencing operations on or after april 1 2020 these changes or any changes that would reduce or deny sez tax benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition all indian profits including those generated within sezs are subject to the minimum alternative tax or mat at the rate of 213 any mat paid is creditable against future corporate income tax subject to limitations currently we anticipate utilizing our existing mat balances against future corporate income tax our ability to fully do so may be influenced by possible changes to the indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of cognizant india our potential inability to fully utilize our deferred income tax assets related to the mat could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating to our common stock and governing documents 

our stock price continues to be volatile 

our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline 

provisions in our charter and bylaws and provisions under delaware law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals 

provisions in our charter and bylaws each as amended and delaware general corporate law or dgcl may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover proposals or delaying or preventing changes in our control or management including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices these provisions include 

 these provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are conducting an internal investigation focused on whether certain payments relating to companyowned facilities in india were made improperly and in possible violation of the fcpa and other applicable laws the investigation is also examining various other payments made in small amounts in india that may not have complied with company policy or applicable law in september 2016 we voluntarily notified the doj and sec and are cooperating fully with both agencies the investigation is being conducted under the oversight of the audit committee with the assistance of outside counsel to date the investigation has identified a total of approximately 6 million in payments made between 2009 and 2016 that may have been improper based on the results of the investigation to date no material adjustments restatements or other revisions to our previously issued financial statements are required 

on october 5 2016 october 27 2016 and november 18 2016 three putative securities class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the district of new jersey naming us and certain of our current and former officers as defendants in an order dated february 3 2017 the united states district court for the district of new jersey consolidated the three putative securities class actions into a single action and appointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel on april 7 2017 the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on behalf of a putative class of stockholders who purchased our common stock during the period between february 27 2015 and september 29 2016 naming us and certain of our current and former officers as defendants and alleging violations of the exchange act based on allegedly false or misleading statements related to potential violations of the fcpa our business prospects and operations and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures the lead plaintiffs seek an award of compensatory damages among other relief and their reasonable costs and expenses including attorneys’ fees under a stipulation filed by the parties on february 23 2017 defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on june 6 2017 plaintiffs filed an opposition brief on july 21 2017 responding to defendants’ motions to dismiss and defendants filed reply briefs in further support of their motions to dismiss on september 5 2017 on september 5 2017 defendants also filed a motion to strike certain allegations in the consolidated amended complaint plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to strike on october 2 2017 and on october 10 2017 we filed a reply brief in further support of the motion to strike 

on october 31 2016 november 15 2016 and november 18 2016 three putative shareholder derivative complaints were filed in new jersey superior court bergen county naming us all of our then current directors and certain of our current and former officers as defendants on january 24 2017 the new jersey superior court bergen county consolidated the three putative shareholder derivative actions filed in that court into a single action and appointed lead plaintiff and lead counsel the 

complaints assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty corporate waste unjust enrichment abuse of control mismanagement andor insider selling by defendants on march 16 2017 the parties filed a stipulation deferring all further proceedings pending a final nonappealable ruling on the then anticipated motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action on april 26 2017 in lieu of ordering the stipulation filed by the parties the new jersey superior court deferred further proceedings by dismissing the consolidated putative shareholder derivative litigation without prejudice but permitting the parties to file a motion to vacate the dismissal in the future on february 22 2017 a fourth putative shareholder derivative complaint asserting similar claims was filed in the united states district court for the district of new jersey naming us and certain of our then current directors as defendants on april 5 2017 the united states district court for the district of new jersey entered an order staying all proceedings pending a final nonappealable ruling on the then anticipated motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action on april 7 2017 a fifth putative shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the united states district court for the district of new jersey naming us certain of our then current directors and certain of our current and former officers as defendants the complaint in that action asserts claims similar to those in the previouslyfiled putative shareholder derivative actions but also adds a claim for violations of section 10b of the exchange act against the individual defendants on may 10 2017 a sixth putative shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the united states district court for the district of new jersey naming us certain of our then current directors and certain of our current and former officers as defendants the complaint in that action asserts claims similar to those in the previouslyfiled putative shareholder derivative actions but also adds a claim for violations of section 14a of the exchange act against the individual defendants in an order dated june 20 2017 the united states district court for the district of new jersey consolidated the three putative shareholder derivative actions filed in that court into a single action appointed lead plaintiff and lead counsel and stayed all further proceedings pending a final nonappealable ruling on the motions to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action all of the putative shareholder derivative complaints allege among other things that certain of our public disclosures were false and misleading by failing to disclose that payments allegedly in violation of the fcpa had been made and by asserting that management had determined that our internal controls were effective the plaintiffs seek awards of compensatory damages and restitution to the company as a result of the alleged violations and their costs and attorneys’ fees experts’ fees and other litigation expenses among other relief 

  

we are presently unable to predict the duration scope or result of the audit committee’s investigation any investigations by the doj or the sec the consolidated putative securities class action the putative shareholder derivative actions or any other lawsuits as such we are presently unable to develop a reasonable estimate of a possible loss or range of losses if any and thus have not recorded any accruals related to these matters the doj and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations including injunctive relief disgorgement fines penalties modifications to business practices including the termination or modification of existing business relationships the imposition of compliance programs and the retention of a monitor to oversee compliance with the fcpa in addition the doj and the sec could bring enforcement actions against the company or individuals including former members of senior management such actions if brought could result in dispositions judgments settlements fines injunctions cease and desist orders debarment or other civil or criminal penalties against the company or such individuals 

we expect to incur additional expenses related to remedial measures and may incur additional expenses related to fines the imposition of any sanctions or the implementation of remedial measures could have a material adverse effect on our business annual and interim results of operations cash flows and financial condition furthermore while the company intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously these lawsuits and any other related lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties the actual cost of such litigation will depend upon many unknown factors and the outcome of the litigation is necessarily uncertain 

we are also involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of our management the outcome of such claims and legal actions if decided adversely is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results cash flows or consolidated financial position

our objective is to create value for both our customers and stockholders by enhancing our position as a leading professional services company in the digital era our digital services and solutions are designed to help our customers win in the digital economy by applying technology and analytics to change consumer experiences to drive sustainable growth deploying systems of intelligence to automate and improve core business processes and improving technology systems by deploying cloud and cyber security solutions and asaservice models to make them simpler more modern and secure to accelerate our shift to digital services and solutions we are deploying the following strategies 

 we believe the above strategies combined with improving the overall efficiency of our operations will enable us to gradually expand our nongaap operating margins 1  with the goal of achieving 22 nongaap operating margin 1  in 2019 there can be no assurances that we will be successful in achieving this plan or that other factors beyond our control including the various risks described in part i item 1a risk factors  will not cause us to fail to achieve the targeted improvements 

in 2017 we began a realignment of our business by executing on the above strategies and improving the overall efficiency of our operations while continuing to drive revenue growth as part of this realignment plan we incurred expenses of 72 million  in 2017 which are reported in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and are comprised of severance costs including costs related to a voluntary separation program or vsp lease termination costs and advisory fees related to nonroutine shareholder matters and to the development of our realignment and return of capital programs the costs related to the realignment are excluded from nongaap operating margin 1  and nongaap diluted earnings per share 1  we believe the majority of the costs related to the realignment have already been incurred although we anticipate that we may incur additional realignment costs in 2018 

 



in february 2017 we announced a plan to return 34 billion to our stockholders over a twoyear period during 2017 as part of this plan we entered into multiple accelerated stock repurchase agreements collectively referred to as the asr to repurchase 18 billion of stock and in may 2017 initiated a quarterly cash dividend during 2017 we paid dividends totaling 265 million and in february 2018 increased our quarterly dividend to 020 per share on an ongoing basis we review our capital return plan considering our financial performance and liquidity position investments required to execute our strategic initiatives the economic outlook regulatory changes and other relevant factors accordingly we are currently evaluating the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act or tax reform act on our capital return plan 

the following table sets forth a summary of our financial results for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  



the key drivers of our revenue growth in 2017  as compared to 2016 were as follows 

 our customers seek to apply digital technologies to transform the way they engage with customers and employees and to develop innovative products and services and bring them quickly to market companies are also eager to automate additional aspects of their business to improve their cost structures and increase the quality and velocity of their operations increasingly the relative emphasis among our customers is shifting towards investment and innovation as reflected in accelerated demand for our digital services we also saw an increase in demand for larger more complex projects including managed services contracts which are transformational for our customers such contracts may have longer sales cycles and rampup periods and could lead to greater variability in our period to period operating results 

 



in 2017  our operating margin decreased to 168  from 170 in 2016  while our nongaap operating margin increased to 197 3  from 195 3  in 2016  the decrease in our gaap operating margin was due to increases in compensation and benefit costs the impact of realignment charges and an increase in depreciation expense partially offset by efficiencies of leveraging our cost structure over a larger organization and a reduction in immigration costs the increase in our nongaap operating margin was due to efficiencies of leveraging our cost structure over a larger organization and a reduction in immigration costs partially offset by increases in compensation and benefit costs and an increase in depreciation expense 

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted the tax reform act which significantly revised the us corporate income tax law for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 by among other provisions 

 as a result of the enactment of the tax reform act our historical and future foreign earnings are no longer subject to us federal income taxes upon repatriation beyond the onetime transition tax we therefore reevaluated our assertion that our nonus earnings would be indefinitely reinvested and concluded that our indian earnings will continue to be indefinitely reinvested while the accumulated undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries other than our indian subsidiaries are now available for repatriation to the united states during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded a onetime provisional net income tax expense of 617 million which is comprised of i the onetime transition tax expense on accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of 635 million ii foreign and us state income tax expense that will be applicable upon repatriation of the accumulated undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries other than our indian subsidiaries of 53 million partially offset by iii an income tax benefit of 71 million resulting from the revaluation of us net deferred income tax liabilities to the new lower us income tax rate the onetime incremental income tax expense is provisional as it reflects certain assumptions based upon our interpretation of the tax reform act as of january 18 2018 and may change possibly materially as we receive additional clarification and guidance and as the interpretation of the tax reform act evolves over time 

our effective income tax rate for 2017 was 434 as compared to 342 in 2016 our 2017 effective income tax rate included a negative impact of 232 of pretax earnings due to the tax reform act our 2016 effective income tax rate included a negative impact of 101 of pretax earnings due to the onetime tax adjustment relating to the india cash remittance 

for the years 2018 through 2020 we expect our effective income tax rate to be in the range of 24 to 26 excluding the impact of discrete items if any our projected effective income tax rates incorporate the anticipated impact of the tax reform act assumptions regarding our future earnings and their geographic mix management’s assessment of tax law in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and other risks and uncertainties as such our effective income tax rate projections are subject to change possibly materially due to changes in underlying estimates and assumptions changes in tax law and guidance that may be issued actions the company may take as a result of these developments as well as other factors that may be beyond our control 

as previously disclosed the company is conducting an internal investigation focused on whether certain payments relating to companyowned facilities in india were made improperly and in possible violation of the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and other applicable laws the investigation is also examining various other payments made in small amounts in india that may not have complied with company policy or applicable law in september 2016 we voluntarily notified the department of justice or doj and the securities and exchange commission or sec and are cooperating fully with both agencies the investigation is being conducted under the oversight of the audit committee with the assistance of outside counsel to date the investigation has identified a total of approximately 6 million in payments made between 2009 and 2016 that may have been improper in the second half of 2016 we recorded an outofperiod correction related to 4 million of such payments that had been previously capitalized that should have been expensed there were no adjustments recorded during 2017 related to the amounts under investigation 

 



in 2016 there were putative securities class action complaints filed naming us and certain of our current and former officers as defendants and alleging violations of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act based on allegedly false or misleading statements related to potential violations of the fcpa our business prospects and operations and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures additionally in 2017 and 2016 putative shareholder derivative complaints were filed naming us certain of our current and former directors and certain of our current and former officers as defendants see the section titled  part i item 3 legal proceedings  

in 2017  we incurred 36 million in costs related to the fcpa investigation and related lawsuits in addition to the 27 million we incurred in 2016 we expect to continue to incur expenses related to these matters in 2018 

we finished the year with approximately 260000  employees which is a decrease of approximately 200  over the prior year end annualized turnover including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 179  for the three months ended december 31 2017  the majority of our turnover occurs in india as a result annualized attrition rates in the united states and europe are below our global attrition rate in addition attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff 

during 2018  barring any unforeseen events we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results 

 in response to this environment we plan to 



business segments 

our reportable segments are 



our chief operating decision maker evaluates cognizant’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenues and operating expenses to different degrees expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the global delivery centers certain selling general and administrative expenses excess or shortfall of incentive compensation for delivery personnel as compared to target stockbased compensation expense costs related to our realignment program a portion of depreciation and amortization and the impact of the settlements of our cash flow hedges are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker accordingly such expenses are excluded from segment operating profit 

we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for that segment however no individual customer accounted for sales in excess of 10 of our consolidated revenues during 2017  2016  or 2015  in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and we believe that a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues 

 results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2017   

the following table sets forth certain financial data for the three years ended december 31 2017  

 

 revenues  overall  revenues increased by 98  during 2017  as compared to an increase of 86 in 2016  the increases in revenues in 2017  and 2016 were primarily attributed to services related to the integration of digital technologies that are reshaping our customers business and operating models to align with shifts in consumer preferences increased customer spending on discretionary projects continued interest in using our global delivery model as a means to reduce overall technology and operations costs and continued penetration in all our geographic markets revenues from new customers contributed 208 million  and 220 million representing 157  and 205 of the yearoveryear revenue growth for 2017  and

as we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline over time

north america continues to be our largest market representing 773  of total 2017  revenues and 683  of total revenue growth in 2017  the increase in revenues in 2017  in this region was primarily attributed to services related to the integration of digital technologies that are reshaping our customers business and operating models to align with shifts in consumer preferences increased customer spending on discretionary projects and continued interest in using our global delivery model as a means to reduce overall technology and operations costs in 2017 revenue growth in europe and rest of world markets was driven by an increase in demand for an expanded range of services such as business process services and customer adoption

income from operations and operating margin  overall  income from operations increased 84  in 2017  as compared to an increase of 69 in 2016  our operating margin decreased to 168  of revenues in 2017  from 170 of revenues in 2016  due to increases in compensation and benefit costs the impact of realignment charges and an increase in depreciation expense partially offset by efficiencies of leveraging our cost structure over a larger organization and a reduction in immigration costs in 2016  operating margin decreased to 170 of revenues from 173 of revenues in 2015  due to increases in compensation and benefit costs excluding incentivebased compensation increases in certain professional service costs and increases in depreciation and amortization due to recent acquisitions partially offset by the impact of lower incentivebased compensation in 2016 the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar and realized gains on settlement of cash flow hedges in 2016 as compared to losses in 2015 excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges the appreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately 58  basis points or 058  percentage points in 2017  while in 2016  the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 90 basis points or 090 percentage points each additional 10 change in exchange rate between the indian rupee and the us dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 19  basis points or 019  percentage points 

we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain indian rupee denominated payments in india these hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the indian rupee during the year ended december 31 2017  the settlement of certain cash flow hedges positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 87 basis points or 087 percentage points as compared to a positive impact of approximately 13 basis points or 013 percentage points in 2016 and a negative impact of approximately 57 basis points or 057 percentage points in 2015

our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals in certain regions competition for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation as with other service providers in our industry we must adequately anticipate wage increases particularly on our fixedprice and transaction or volumebased priced contracts historically we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs in india however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs the mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future 

segment operating profit segment operating profits were as follows 



in 2017 in our financial services products and resources and communications media and technology business segments operating profits decreased as a percentage of revenues due to increases in compensation and benefits costs investments to accelerate our shift to digital including reskilling of service delivery personnel and the negative impact of the appreciation of various currencies including the indian rupee against the us dollar our financial services segment’s operating profit was negatively impacted by weakness in the banking sector as certain customers focused on optimizing their cost structure and managing their discretionary spending the segment operating profit of our healthcare business segment increased as a percentage of revenues benefiting from lower losses on certain fixedprice contracts with customers in 2017 

in 2016 across all our segments segment operating profit decreased as a percentage of revenues due to increases in compensation and benefit costs excluding incentivebased compensation increases in certain professional service costs and continued investments to grow our business partially offset by the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar the operating profit in our healthcare segment was further impacted by a loss on a fixedprice contract with a customer of 27 million in 2016 the unallocated costs decreased when compared to 2015 primarily due to lower incentivebased compensation accrual rates in 2016 compared to 2015 

 



other income expense net  total other income expense net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses interest income and interest expense the following table sets forth total other income expense net for the years ended december 31 



the foreign currency exchange gains losses in all the years presented were primarily attributable to the remeasurement of the indian rupee denominated net monetary assets and liabilities in our us dollar functional currency india subsidiaries as 

well as the remeasurement of other net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries the losses on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments relate to the realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts entered into primarily to offset foreign currency exposure to the indian rupee and other nonus dollar denominated net monetary assets and liabilities as of december 31 2017  the notional value of our undesignated hedges was 255 million  the increases in interest income in 2017  and 2016  were primarily attributed to increases in average invested balances

for the years 2018 through 2020 we expect our effective income tax rate to be in the range of 24 to 26 excluding the impact of discrete items if any our projected effective income tax rates incorporate the anticipated impact of the tax reform act assumptions regarding our future earnings and their geographic mix management’s assessment of tax law in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and other risks and uncertainties as such our effective income tax rate projections are subject to change possibly materially due to changes in underlying estimates and assumptions changes in tax law and guidance that may be issued actions the company may take as a result of these developments as well as other factors that may be beyond our control 

in may 2016 india enacted the finance bill 2016 that among other things expanded the applicability of india’s buyback distribution tax to certain share buyback transactions occurring after june 1 2016 in midmay prior to the june 1 2016 effective date of the enactment our principal operating subsidiary in india repurchased shares from its shareholders which are nonindian cognizant entities valued at 28 billion this transaction or the india cash remittance was undertaken pursuant to a plan approved by the high court of madras and simplified the shareholding structure of our principal operating subsidiary in india pursuant to the transaction our principal indian operating subsidiary repurchased approximately 12 billion of the total 28 billion of shares from its us shareholders resulting in incremental tax expense while the remaining 16 billion was repurchased from its shareholder outside the united states net of taxes the transaction resulted in a remittance of cash to the united states in the amount of 10 billion as a result of this transaction we incurred an incremental 2016 income tax expense of 238 million

nongaap financial measures   

portions of our disclosure including the following table include nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share these nongaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies in addition these nongaap measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap the reconciliations of cognizant’s nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures should be carefully evaluated 

our nongaap income from operations and nongaap operating margin exclude stockbased compensation expense acquisitionrelated charges and in 2017 realignment charges our definition of nongaap diluted earnings per share excludes net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses the effect of recognition in the first quarter of 2017 of an income tax benefit previously unrecognized in our consolidated financial statements related to a specific uncertain tax position the impact of the onetime incremental income tax expense related to the tax reform act in 2017 and the impact of a onetime incremental income tax expense related to the india cash remittance in 2016 in addition to excluding stockbased compensation expense acquisitionrelated charges and in 2017 realignment charges our nongaap diluted earnings per share is additionally adjusted for the income tax impact of the above items as applicable the income tax impact of each item is calculated by applying the statutory rate and local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred 

we believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the company provides enhanced transparency into the operating results of the company for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes we use nongaap financial measures for financial and operational decision making to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons to determine portions of the compensation for our executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors therefore it is our belief that the use of nongaap financial measures excluding these costs provides a meaningful supplemental measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance accordingly we believe that the presentation of nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share when read in conjunction with our reported gaap results can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 

a limitation of using nongaap financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap is that nongaap measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with gaap and exclude costs that are recurring namely stockbased compensation expense certain acquisitionrelated charges and net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses in addition other companies may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than us thereby limiting the usefulness of these nongaap financial measures as a comparative tool we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share to allow investors to evaluate such nongaap financial measures 

the following table presents a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to the most comparable gaap measure for the years ended december 31 



 

 

 

the effective income tax rate related to each of our nongaap adjustments varies depending on the jurisdictions in which such income and expenses are generated and the statutory rates applicable in those jurisdictions

our cash generated from operations has historically been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to grow our business in addition as of december 31 2017  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 5056  million and additional available capacity under our revolving credit facility of approximately 675 million  the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the three years ended december 31 



operating activities the increase in cash generated from operating activities for 2017  compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to the increase in pretax earnings the decrease in cash generated from operating activities for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributed to the decrease in net income which includes the impact of incremental taxes paid in connection with the india cash remittance and higher incentive based compensation payments in 2016 as compared to 2015 trade accounts receivable increased to 2865 million  at december 31 2017  as compared to 2556 million at december 31 2016  and 2253 million at december 31 2015  unbilled accounts receivable were 357 million  at december 31 2017  349 million at december 31 2016  and 369 million at december 31 2015  the increase in trade accounts receivable during 2017  was primarily due to increased revenues 

we monitor turnover aging and the collection of accounts receivable by customer our days sales outstanding calculation includes billed and unbilled accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts reduced by the uncollected portion of our deferred revenue our days sales outstanding was 71 days as of december 31 2017  72 days as of december 31 2016 and 70 days as of december 31 2015 

investing activities  the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2017  compared to 2016 is due to lower net purchases of investments and lower payments for acquisitions in 2016  the decrease in net cash used when compared to 2015  was primarily due to lower net purchases of investments partially offset by higher payments for acquisitions and equity and cost method investments 

financing activities  the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2017  compared to 2016  is primarily attributable to repurchases of common stock under the asr and dividend payments partially offset by lower net repayments of debt in 2016 the increase in cash used when compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to higher net repayments of debt and an increase in stock repurchases 

in 2014 we entered into a credit agreement with a commercial bank syndicate or the credit agreement providing for a 1000 million unsecured term loan and a 750 million revolving credit facility the term loan was used to pay a portion of 

the cash consideration in connection with our 2014 acquisition of tz us parent inc or trizetto the revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes the term loan and the revolving credit facility both mature in november 2019 as of december 31 2017  we had 800 million  outstanding under the term loan and 75 million  in outstanding notes under the revolving credit facility 

the credit agreement contains certain negative covenants including limitations on liens mergers consolidations and acquisitions subsidiary indebtedness and affiliate transactions as well as certain affirmative covenants in addition the credit agreement requires us to maintain a debt to total stockholders equity ratio not in excess of 040 to 100 as of december 31 2017  we are in compliance with our debt covenants and have provided a quarterly certification to our lenders to that effect we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the credit agreement to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the remaining available capacity under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2017  and through the date of this filing 

in february 2017 we announced a plan to return 34 billion to stockholders by the end of 2018 through a combination of stock repurchases and cash dividends as part of this plan in 2017 we expended 18 billion to repurchase our class a common stock under the asr and paid cash dividends totaling 265 million the payments related to the asr were funded with cash on hand in the us and borrowings under the revolving credit facility we expect to fund the remaining portion of the capital return plan from cash from operations and from available capacity under our revolving credit facility stock repurchases may be made from time to time through openmarket purchases through the use of rule 10b51 plans andor by other means we are currently evaluating the longer term impact the tax reform act may have on our overall capital return program as a first step in february 2018 our board of directors approved an increase to our quarterly dividend to 020 per share 

our board of directors reviews our capital return plan on an ongoing basis with consideration given to our financial performance economic outlook regulatory changes and any other relevant factors the board of directors’ determinations regarding future share repurchases and dividends will include evaluating the longer term impact of the tax reform act as well as a variety of other factors including our net income cash flow generated from operations or other sources liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results as these factors may change over time the amount of stock repurchase activity and actual amount of dividends declared if any during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time there can be no guarantee that we will achieve the objective of our announced capital return plan in the amounts or within the expected time frame that we have indicated or at all 

as a result of the enactment of the tax reform act our historical and future foreign earnings are no longer subject to us federal income tax upon repatriation beyond the onetime transition tax we therefore reevaluated our assertion that our nonus earnings would be indefinitely reinvested and concluded that our indian earnings will continue to be indefinitely reinvested while historical accumulated undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 other than our indian subsidiaries are available for repatriation to the united states 

we use various strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of our domestic and international cash flows and cash balances as of december 31 2017 4858 million of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held outside the united states of which 1397 million was held in india we are currently evaluating what portion of the nonus cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside india is needed locally to execute our strategic plans and what amount is available for repatriation back to the united states 

our current plans do not demonstrate the need to repatriate our historical undistributed earnings of our india subsidiaries to fund our liquidity needs outside of india in reaching this conclusion we considered our global capital needs the available sources of liquidity globally and our growth plans in india however future events may occur such as material changes in cash estimates discretionary transactions including corporate restructurings and changes in applicable laws which may lead us to repatriate indian earnings if we were to change our assertion that our accumulated undistributed indian earnings are indefinitely reinvested we would expect based on our current interpretation of indian tax law to accrue additional tax expense at a rate of approximately 21 of cash available for distribution which could have a material adverse effect on our future effective income tax rate this estimate is subject to change based on tax legislative developments in india and other jurisdictions as well as judicial and interpretive developments of applicable tax laws 

we expect our operating cash flow cash and investment balances and available capacity under our revolving credit facility to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months we expect to fund the onetime transition tax of 635 million which is payable over eight years from cash generated from operations and the repatriation of a portion of our historical nonus earnings that are available for distribution to the united states our ability to expand and 

grow our business in accordance with current plans to make acquisitions and form joint ventures to meet our longterm capital requirements and to execute our announced capital return plan beyond a twelve month period will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we cannot be certain that additional financing if required will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all 

commitments and contingencies 

commitments 

as of december 31 2017  we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments 



  

 

as of december 31 2017  we had 97 million  of unrecognized tax benefits this represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution the resolution of these income tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 

as announced in february 2018 we intend to set up and provide 100 million of initial funding to the cognizant us foundation which will focus on science technology engineering and math or collectively stem education in the united states 

contingencies 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated when a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable we do not record a liability but instead disclose the nature and the amount of the claim and an estimate of the loss or range of loss if such an estimate can be made legal fees are expensed as incurred in the opinion of management the outcome of any existing claims and legal or regulatory proceedings other than the specific matters described below if decided adversely is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

as previously disclosed the company has been conducting an internal investigation focused on whether certain payments relating to companyowned facilities in india were made improperly and in possible violation of the fcpa and other applicable laws the investigation is also examining various other payments made in small amounts in india that may not have complied with company policy or applicable law in september 2016 we voluntarily notified the doj and sec and are cooperating fully 

with both agencies the investigation is being conducted under the oversight of the audit committee with the assistance of outside counsel 

in 2016 there were putative securities class action complaints filed naming us and certain of our current and former officers as defendants and alleging violations of the exchange act based on allegedly false or misleading statements related to potential violations of the fcpa our business prospects and operations and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures additionally in 2017 and 2016 putative shareholder derivative complaints were filed naming us certain of our current and former directors and certain of our current and former officers as defendants see the section titled  part i item 3 legal proceedings  

we have indemnification and expense advancement obligations pursuant to our bylaws and indemnification agreements with respect to certain current and former members of senior management and the company’s directors in connection with the ongoing internal investigation we have received requests under such indemnification agreements and our bylaws to provide funds for legal fees and other expenses and expect additional requests in connection with the investigation and related litigation we have not recorded any liability for these matters as of december 31 2017 as we cannot estimate the ultimate outcome at this time but have expensed payments made through december 31 2017 

we have maintained directors and officers insurance from which a portion of the indemnification expenses and costs related to the putative securities class action complaints may be recoverable and have recorded an insurance receivable of less than 1 million as of december 31 2017 we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period related to the indemnification agreements described here 

many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our customers including any breach involving a customer’s confidential information or sensitive data or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our services there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover all types of claims continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed or are not covered by our insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain customer engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify customers or other parties with whom we conduct business with respect to certain matters these arrangements can include provisions whereby we agree to hold the indemnified party and certain of their affiliated entities harmless with respect to thirdparty claims related to such matters as our breach of certain representations or covenants our intellectual property infringement our gross negligence or willful misconduct or certain other claims made against certain parties payments by us under any of these arrangements are generally conditioned on the customer making a claim and providing us with full control over the defense and settlement of such claim it is not possible to determine the maximum potential liability under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically we have not made payments under these indemnification agreements and therefore they have not had any impact on our operating results financial position or cash flows however if events arise requiring us to make payment for indemnification claims under our indemnification obligations in contracts we have entered such payments could have material impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than our foreign exchange forward contracts there were no offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2017  2016  and 2015  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap we base our estimates on historical experience current trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared we evaluate our estimates on a continuous basis however the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial statements as they require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain changes to these estimates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition our significant accounting policies are described in note 1  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenues related to our fixedprice highly complex application development contracts and certain other fixedprice contracts are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method and the proportional performance method of accounting respectively under the percentage of completion method total contract revenues during the term of an agreement are recognized based on the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost cost to cost method under the proportional performance method total contract revenues are recognized based on the level of effort to date in relation to total expected efforts provided to the customer management reviews the assumptions related to these methods on an ongoing basis revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and such losses are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations changes in estimates related to our revenue contracts and contract losses were immaterial to the consolidated results of operations for the periods presented 

income taxes  determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and related valuation allowance if any and liabilities requires significant judgment we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate the consolidated provision for income taxes may also change period to period based on nonrecurring events such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of reserves established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related interest which may require us to apply judgment to complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit to the extent that the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies if it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred income tax asset will not be realized a valuation allowance is provided in the event we change our determination as to the amount of deferred income tax assets that can be realized we will adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact recorded to our provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our indian subsidiaries collectively referred to as cognizant india are primarily exportoriented companies and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the government of india for export activities conducted within sezs for periods of up to 15 years a majority of our sez income tax holiday benefits are currently scheduled to expire in whole or in part during the years 2018 to 2026 and may be extended on a limited basis for an additional five years per unit if certain reinvestment criteria are met we have constructed and expect to continue to operate most of our newer development facilities in sezs our indian profits ineligible for sez benefits are subject to corporate income tax at the rate of 346 in addition all indian profits including those generated within sezs are subject to the mat at the rate of 213 any mat paid is creditable against future indian corporate income tax subject to limitations currently we anticipate utilizing our existing mat balances 

against our future corporate income tax obligations in india however our ability to do so could be impacted by possible changes to the indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of cognizant india 

the onetime provisional incremental income tax expense related to the tax reform act reflects assumptions based upon our interpretation of the tax reform act as of january 18 2018 and may change possibly materially as we receive additional clarification and guidance and as the interpretation of the tax reform act evolves over time the calculation of the provisional incremental income tax expense is based upon various estimates and assumptions and may be impacted by additional considerations including but not limited to the final computation of 2017 earnings and profits of nonus subsidiaries as of the relevant measurement dates the provisional amount will be finalized when the 2017 us corporate tax return is filed in 2018 see note 10  to our consolidated financial statements 

stockbased compensation  stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited in addition for performance stock units we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period to the extent that actual results differ significantly from our estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

derivative financial instruments  derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date our derivative financial instruments consist of foreign exchange forward contracts we estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange forward contract by using a present value of expected cash flows model this model utilizes various assumptions including timing and amounts of cash flows discount rates and counterparty credit risk factors the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

investments  our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of time deposits mutual funds invested in fixed income securities indian rupee denominated commercial paper indian rupee denominated international corporate bonds and government debt securities us dollar denominated corporate bonds municipal bonds certificates of deposit commercial paper debt issuances by the us government us government agencies foreign governments and supranational entities and assetbacked securities the assetbacked securities included securities backed by auto loans credit card receivables and other receivables the years of issuance of our assetbacked securities fall primarily in the 2012 to 2017 range our longterm investments are comprised of heldtomaturity corporate and other debt securities as well as equity and cost method investments 

we utilize various inputs to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio to the extent they exist unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets level 1 or quoted prices on similar assets in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active or observable and marketcorroborated inputs other than quoted prices collectively level 2 are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in the absence of quoted prices or liquid markets valuation techniques would be used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable level 3 valuation techniques are based on various assumptions including timing and amounts of cash flows discount rates rate of return and adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity a significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using level 3 inputs as of december 31 2017 none of our investments were categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy see note 12  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our security valuation methodologies 

we periodically evaluate if unrealized losses as determined based on the security valuation methodologies discussed above on individual securities classified as availableforsale or heldtomaturity are considered to be otherthantemporary the analysis of otherthantemporary impairment requires the use of various assumptions including the length of time an investment’s cost basis is greater than fair value the severity of the investment’s decline any credit deterioration of the investment whether management intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security we consider the security to be otherthantemporarily impaired and we record the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its recoverable amount in earnings and the difference between the security’s recoverable amount and fair value in other comprehensive income if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the security is also considered otherthantemporarily impaired and we recognize the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value in earnings 

business combinations  accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions we account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed including any contingent consideration and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to 

properly allocate purchase price consideration to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation of the purchase price utilizes significant estimates in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets the significant estimates and assumptions include the timing and amount of forecasted revenues and cash flows anticipated growth rates customer attrition rates the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and the determination of useful lives for finitelived assets 

longlived assets and finitelived intangibles  we review longlived assets and certain finitelived identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable we recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such assets the impairment loss is determined as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset assessing the fair value of assets involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles  we exercise judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units expected to benefit from each business combination goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate regulatory environment established business plans operating performance indicators or competition evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach using market multiples under the income approach we estimate projected future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and long term growth rates and determine the appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows the discount rate used is based on our weightedaverage cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected future cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenues and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit there was no indication of goodwill impairment as a result of our 2017 annual impairment analysis as the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their respective net book values including goodwill further a 10 increase or decrease in any of the key assumptions used under either the income approach or the market approach would not result in a significant impact to the excess fair value over book value for any of our reporting units 

the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant our 2017  qualitative assessment included the review of relevant macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets was below carrying value 

based on our most recent evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which was performed as of december 31 2017  none of our reporting units or indefinitelived intangible assets was considered to be at risk of impairment as of december 31 2017  our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances were 2704 million  and 63 million respectively 

contingencies  loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated when a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable we do not record a liability but instead disclose the nature and amount of the claim and an estimate of the loss or range of loss if such an estimate can be made significant judgment is required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective and based on the information available from the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel as additional information becomes available we reassess any potential liability related to any pending litigation and may revise our estimates such revisions in estimates of any potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee additionally the brexit referendum and its effect on the british pound may subject us to increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rate movements accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures 

revenues from our customers in the united kingdom rest of europe and rest of world represented 78  84  and 65  respectively of our 2017  revenues and are typically denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates primarily the indian rupee the british pound and the euro as compared to the us dollar 

a portion of our costs in india representing approximately 225  of our global operating costs during 2017  are denominated in the indian rupee and are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses these us dollar  indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs as of december 31 2017  the notional value and weighted average contract rates of these contracts were as follows 



as of december 31 2017  the unrealized gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was 154 million  based upon a sensitivity analysis at december 31 2017  which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts of approximately 198 million  

a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may result in nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement in 2017  we reported foreign currency exchange gains exclusive of hedging losses of approximately 90  million which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 we had 1546 million in cash cash equivalents and investments denominated in indian rupees based 

upon a sensitivity analysis a 100 change in the indian rupee exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the us dollar reported value of these balances and a corresponding nonoperating foreign currency exchange gain or loss of approximately 156 million 

we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary these contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets and liabilities we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2018  that are used to hedge our foreign currency denominated net monetary assets and liabilities at december 31 2017  the notional value of the outstanding contracts was 255 million  and the related fair value was a liability of 5 million  based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2017  which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 23 million  

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2017  we have 800 million outstanding under our term loan and 75 million  in outstanding notes under the revolving credit facility the credit agreement requires interest to be paid at either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate plus a margin the margin over the base rate is 000 and the margin over the eurocurrency rate ranges from 075 to 1125 depending on our debt ratings or if we have not received debt ratings from 0875 to 100 depending on our debt to total stockholders equity ratio thus our debt exposes us to market risk from changes in interest rates we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our interest expense a 100 change in interest rates with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a 47 change to our reported interest expense for 2017 

in addition our availableforsale and heldtomaturity fixed income securities are subject to market risk from changes in interest rates as of december 31 2017  our availableforsale and heldtomaturity portfolios were 1972 million and 906 million respectively as of december 31 2017  a 10 change in interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a change in the fair market value of our availableforsale and heldtomaturity investment securities of approximately 6 million and 2 million respectively we typically invest in highly rated securities and our policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss we may sell our availableforsale investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes in anticipation of credit deterioration or for duration management our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of time deposits mutual funds invested in fixed income securities indian rupee denominated commercial paper indian rupee denominated international corporate bonds and government debt securities us dollar denominated corporate bonds municipal bonds certificates of deposit commercial paper debt issuances by the us government us government agencies foreign governments and supranational entities and assetbacked securities the assetbacked securities included securities backed by auto loans credit card receivables and other receivables 

information provided by the sensitivity analysis of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk does not necessarily represent the actual changes that would occur under normal market conditions

as previously disclosed the company is conducting an internal investigation focused on whether certain payments relating to companyowned facilities in india were made improperly and in possible violation of the fcpa and other applicable laws the investigation is also examining various other payments made in small amounts in india that may not have complied with company policy or applicable law based on the findings of the internal investigation as of each date in our quarterly report on form 10q for the third quarter of 2016 and in subsequent reporting periods through the quarterly report on form 

10q for the third quarter of 2017 we disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as we did not maintain an effective internal control environment specifically we did not maintain an effective tone at the top as certain members of senior management may have participated in or been aware of the making of potentially improper payments and failed to take action to prevent the making of potentially improper payments by either overriding or failing to enforce the controls established by the company relating to real estate and procurement principally in connection with permits for certain facilities in india 

this control deficiency did not result in a material misstatement of our current or prior period consolidated annual or interim financial statements however this control deficiency could have resulted in material misstatements to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not have been prevented or detected accordingly management concluded that this control deficiency constituted a material weakness 

remediation of material weakness 

as of december 31 2017 we have remediated the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting noted above we have undertaken a number of measures designed to directly address or that contributed to the remediation of our material weakness or the enhancement of our internal control over financial reporting while the internal investigation is ongoing based on the results of the investigation to date the members of senior management who may have participated in or been aware of the making of the identified potentially improper payments and failed to take action to prevent the making of the identified potentially improper payments are no longer with the company or in a senior management position additional personnel actions have been taken with respect to other employees 

further among other things we made certain new management appointments including a new president and a new general counsel added resources and personnel to our compliance function and programs enhanced our oversight controls in the areas of procurement and accounts payable as they relate to real estate transactions in india and enhanced our compliance program and control environment through a number of actions including providing additional anticorruption and ethical conduct training and communications to our employees distributing a revised code of ethics worldwide and implementing additional anticorruption policies and procedures 

as of december 31 2017 we were able to demonstrate that these measures implemented as part of our remediation efforts were operating effectively and management therefore concluded that the material weakness described above has been remediated as of that date 

management’s responsibility for the financial statements 

our management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of all information presented in this annual report the consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management’s best estimates and judgments management believes the consolidated financial statements fairly reflect the form and substance of transactions and that the financial statements fairly represent the company’s financial position and results of operations

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

other than described in “remediation of material weakness” above there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2017 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

we face various important risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition and as a result cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock  

risks relating to our business 

we face intense competition from other service providers 

the technology services digital and outsourcing markets are highly competitive characterized by a large number of participants and subject to rapid change various competitors in all or some of such markets include 

 these markets also include numerous smaller local competitors in the various geographic markets in which we operate which may be able to provide services and solutions at lower costs or on terms more attractive to customers than we can our direct competitors include among others accenture atos origin capgemini computer sciences corporation deloitte digital genpact hcl technologies hp enterprise ibm global services infosys technologies tata consultancy services and wipro in certain markets our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals some of our competitors may be more successful than us at capturing the increasing customer demand for digital services increased competition in any of the various market segments in which we compete may put downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services and in turn on our operating margins similarly if our competitors develop and implement processes and methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices without adversely affecting their profit margins if we are unable to provide our customers with superior services and solutions at competitive prices or successfully market those services to current and prospective customers our business results of operations and financial condition may suffer 

our international expansion plans may not be successful if we are unable to compete effectively in other countries we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations additionally such companies may have longstanding or wellestablished relationships with desired customers which may put us at a competitive disadvantage if we fail to compete effectively in the new markets we enter our ability to continue to grow our business could be adversely affected in addition if we cannot compete effectively we may be required to reconsider our strategy to expand internationally as well as our intent not to repatriate our nonus earnings 

we may also face competition from companies that increase in size or scope as the result of strategic mergers or acquisitions these transactions may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers software companies and vendors and service providers which could result in the convergence of products and services if buyers of products and services in the markets we serve favor using a single provider of integrated products and services such buyers may direct more business to such providers which could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and in turn adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to increase our operating margin or our operating margin may decline and we may not be able to improve or sustain our profitability 

we have announced a margin improvement plan to increase gradually our nongaap operating margins over the next few years this plan is reliant upon a number of assumptions including our ability to improve the efficiency of our operations focus on highermargin business reduce costs and make successful investments to grow and further develop our business there can be no assurances that we will be successful in achieving this plan or that other factors beyond our control including 

the various other risks described herein may prevent us from achieving the targeted improvements further our operating margin may decline if we experience declines in demand and pricing for our services an increase in our operating costs including due to an imposition of new nonincome related taxes or change in law or regulations related to immigration or outsourcing or adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates wages in india have historically increased at a faster rate than in the united states which has in the past and may in the future put pressure on our operating margins due to our offshore delivery model additionally the number and type of equitybased compensation awards and the assumptions used in valuing equitybased compensation awards may change in a manner that results in increased stockbased compensation expense and lower margins 

our operating margin and therefore our profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to recover for our services if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our operating margin and our profitability could suffer the rates we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 in addition if we are not able to maintain an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals our profitability may suffer our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 if we are unable to control our costs and operate our business in an efficient manner our operating margin and therefore our profitability may decline 

we could be held liable for damages or our reputation could suffer from security breaches or disclosure of confidential information or personal data 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and securely store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our customers security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or data including personal data in addition many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses the theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our or our customers’ confidential information or other proprietary business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce marketplace acceptance of our services any failure in the networks or computer systems used by us or our customers could result in a claim for substantial damages against us and significant reputational harm regardless of our responsibility for the failure 

in addition we often have access to or are required to manage utilize collect and store sensitive or confidential customer or employee data including personal data as a result we are subject to numerous us and nonus laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of personal data if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches controls or procedures with which we are responsible for complying with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data or if unauthorized access to or disclosure of data in our possession or control occurs we could be subject to liability and penalties in connection with any violation of applicable privacy laws andor criminal prosecution as well as significant liability to our customers or our customers’ customers for breaching contractual 

confidentiality and security provisions or privacy laws these risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloudbased offerings and services and store and process increasingly large amounts of our customers’ confidential information and data and host or manage parts of our customers’ businesses especially in industries involving particularly sensitive data such as the financial services industry and the healthcare industry unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer or employee data including personal data whether through breach of computer systems systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation or otherwise could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems and networks or those we develop or manage for our customers whether by our employees or third parties could result in negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 healthcarerelated data protection privacy and similar laws restrict access use and disclosure of information and failure to comply with or adapt to changes in these laws could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as a service provider in the healthcare industry we are subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act or hitech which are federal laws that apply to firms that provide services to certain entities in the healthcare industry 

a portion of the data that we obtain and handle for or on behalf of our healthcare customers is subject to hipaa and we are required to maintain the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information in accordance with hipaa and the terms of our agreements with customers hitech increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against us and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal court to enforce hipaa’s requirements we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs to establish and maintain hipaarequired safeguards and if additional safeguards are required to comply with hipaa or our healthcare customers requirements our costs could increase further which would negatively affect our results of operations furthermore if we fail to maintain adequate safeguards or we inappropriately use or disclose individually identifiable health information we could be subject to significant liabilities and consequences including 

 laws and expectations relating to privacy security and data protection continue to evolve and we continue to adapt to changing needs nevertheless changes in these laws may limit our data access use and disclosure and may require increased expenditures by us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide services to our healthcare customers and in turn on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our revenues and operating results may experience significant quarterly fluctuations 

we may experience significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations among the factors that could cause these variations are 



 as a result of these factors it is possible that in some future periods our revenues and results of operations may be significantly below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such an event the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on a few customers for a large portion of our revenues 

our top five and top ten customers generated approximately 100  and 167  respectively of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a major customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year the loss of one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business results of operations and financial condition will suffer if we fail to enhance our existing services and solutions and develop new services and solutions that allow us to keep pace with rapidly evolving technological developments including the demand for digital technologies and services 

the technology consulting and business process services markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions we are currently in the midst of a shift towards increasing customer demand for digital technologies and services our future success will depend on our ability to develop digital and other services and solutions that keep pace with changes in the markets in which we operate we cannot be sure that we will be successful in developing digital and other new services and solutions addressing evolving technologies in a timely or costeffective manner or that any services and solutions we do develop will be successful in the marketplace our failure to address the demands of the rapidly evolving technological environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain and attract customers and our competitive position which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business results of operations and financial condition may be affected by the rate of growth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of technology spending by our customers 

our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our customers and prospective customers as well as their customers and suppliers in challenging economic environments our customers may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities or may choose to use their own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm to perform the types of services and solutions we provide in addition many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel processes and infrastructures if the growth of technology usage in business or our customers’ spending on technology in business declines or if we cannot convince our customers or potential customers to embrace new technological solutions our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

most of our contracts with our customers are shortterm and our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if our customers terminate their contracts on short notice 

consistent with industry practice most of our contracts with our customers are shortterm a majority of our contracts can be terminated by our customers with short notice and without significant early termination cost terminations may result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project including the business or financial condition of a customer changes in ownership management or the strategy of a customer or economic or market conditions generally or specific to a customer’s industry when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to eliminate our associated costs in a timely manner consequently our operating margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected if we are unable to replace the lost revenues with other work on terms we find acceptable or effectively eliminate costs our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our customers utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions we predominantly contract to provide services either on a timeandmaterials basis or on a fixedprice basis fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 379  of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations and utilizing workforces with different skill sets and competencies across geographically diverse service locations our pricing cost and operating margin estimates for the work that we perform frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract there is a risk that we will underprice our projects fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the outcome of the internal investigation being conducted under the oversight of our audit committee of possible violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar laws and related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business annual and interim results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we are conducting an internal investigation focused on whether certain payments relating to companyowned facilities in india were made improperly and in possible violation of the fcpa and other applicable laws in september 2016 we voluntarily notified the department of justice or doj and the securities and exchange commission or sec and are cooperating fully with both agencies the investigation is being conducted under the oversight of the audit committee with the assistance of outside counsel we expect to incur additional expenses in connection with conducting the internal investigation 

on october 5 2016 and october 27 2016 two putative securities class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the district of new jersey on behalf of a putative class of stockholders who purchased our common stock during the period between february 25 2016 and september 30 2016 on november 18 2016 a different plaintiff filed a third putative securities class action complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey on behalf of a putative class of stockholders who purchased our common stock during the period between february 27 2015 and september 30 2016 the complaints collectively name us and certain of our current and former officers as defendants and allege violations of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended based on allegedly false or misleading statements related to potential violations of the fcpa our business prospects and operations and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures the plaintiffs collectively seek awards of compensatory damages among other relief and their costs and attorneys’ and experts’ fees the united states district court for the district of new jersey issued an order dated february 3 2017 consolidating the three putative securities class actions 

on october 31 2016 november 15 2016 and november 18 2016 three putative shareholder derivative complaints were filed in new jersey superior court bergen county naming us all of our directors and certain of our current and former officers as defendants on january 24 2017 the new jersey superior court bergen county consolidated the three putative shareholder derivative actions filed in that court the complaints assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty corporate waste unjust enrichment abuse of control mismanagement andor insider selling by defendants on february 22 2017 a fourth putative shareholder derivative complaint asserting similar claims was filed in the united states district court for the district of new jersey naming us and certain of our directors as defendants the complaints allege among other things that certain of our public disclosures were false and misleading by failing to disclose that payments allegedly in violation of the fcpa had been made and by asserting that management had determined that our internal controls were effective the plaintiffs seek awards of compensatory damages and restitution to us as a result of the alleged violations and their costs and attorneys’ fees experts’ fees and other litigation expenses among other relief 

we are presently unable to predict the duration scope or result of the internal investigation the related consolidated putative securities class action the consolidated putative shareholder derivative action or any other related lawsuit and any investigations by the doj or the sec including whether either agency will commence any legal action 

the doj and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations including injunctive relief disgorgement fines penalties the imposition of revised compliance programs and the retention of a monitor to oversee compliance with the fcpa the imposition of any of these sanctions fines or remedial measures could have 

a material adverse effect on our business annual and interim results of operations cash flows and financial condition we could also incur additional expenses related to remedial measures including those that we are implementing in response to our conclusion that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective 

the outcome of the putative class action litigation derivative lawsuit or any other litigation is necessarily uncertain we could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of these lawsuits or future ones and we may not prevail the imposition of any sanctions remedial measures or judgments against us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that could if not remediated result in material misstatements in our financial statements 

as described in “item 9a  controls and procedures” during the closing process for the third quarter of 2016 we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that has required us to amend the previously reported conclusion with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2015 this material weakness remained unremediated as of december 31 2016 

as described in item 9a the company has initiated measures to address this material weakness including personnel actions and enhanced oversight in the areas of procurement and accounts payable as they relate to real estate transactions in india we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken and expect to take will be sufficient to address the issues identified or ensure that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may also distract our officers and employees from other management duties and require material cost to implement new processes or modify our existing processes moreover as our investigation is ongoing other material weaknesses or deficiencies may develop or be identified in the future if we are unable to correct the material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner our ability to record process summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec could be adversely affected 

if we fail to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future we may not be able to report our financial results accurately which may adversely affect our stock price and our business 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations require our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we have committed and will be required to continue to commit significant financial and managerial resources in order to comply with these requirements 

further we are required to integrate any acquired businesses into our system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting companies we acquire may not be required to implement or maintain the disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are required of public companies prior to being acquired by us and we cannot provide assurance as to how long the integration process may take 

internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls we may not have adequate accurate or timely financial information and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company or comply with the requirements of the sec or the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 this could result in a restatement of our financial statements the imposition of sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information any such consequence or other negative effect of our inability to meet our reporting requirements or comply with legal and regulatory requirements as well as any disclosure of an accounting reporting or control issue could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our business 

we may not be able to successfully acquire target companies or integrate acquired companies or technologies into our company and we may become subject to certain liabilities assumed or incurred in connection with our acquisitions that could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services the process of integrating an acquired company business or technology has created and will continue to create operating difficulties the risks we face include 

 although we conduct due diligence in connection with each of our acquisitions there may be liabilities that we fail to discover that we inadequately assess or that are not properly disclosed to us in particular to the extent that any acquired business i failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations ii failed to fulfill contractual obligations to customers or iii incurred material liabilities or obligations to customers that are not identified during the diligence process we as the successor owner may be financially responsible for these violations failures and liabilities and may suffer financial andor reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected in addition as part of an acquisition we may assume responsibilities and obligations of the acquired business pursuant to the terms and conditions of agreements entered by the acquired entity that are not consistent with the terms and conditions that we typically accept and require we also have been and may in the future be subject to litigation or other claims in connection with an acquired business including claims from employees customers stockholders or other third parties any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

we cannot predict or guarantee that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates consummate any acquisition or integrate any acquired business any failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

system failures system outages or operational disruptions in our communications or information technology systems and infrastructure could negatively impact our operations and ability to provide our services and solutions which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

to deliver our services and solutions to our customers we must maintain a high speed network of satellite fiber optic and land lines and active voice and data communications 24 hours a day between our main operating offices in india our other global delivery centers and the offices of our customers worldwide any systems failure or outage or a significant disruption in our ability to transmit voice and data through satellite and telephone communications or in our information technology systems and infrastructure could result in curtailed operations and a loss of customers which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business results of operations and financial condition could be impaired if we lose key members of our management team 

our future performance depends upon the continued service of the key members of our management team competition for experienced executive officers and other key employees in the industries in which we compete is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain key persons or that we will be successful in attracting and retaining replacements in the future the loss of any one or more of our executive officers or significant employees or the failure to attract integrate and retain additional talent could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or significant employees 

in addition our business could be harmed if any key member of our management team leaves our employment and joins one of our competitors currently we have entered into noncompetition agreements with the majority of our executive officers we cannot be certain however that the restrictions in these agreements prohibiting such executive officers from engaging in competitive activities are enforceable any defection by a key member of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

competition for highlyskilled technical personnel is intense and our ability to compete for and manage customer engagements depends on our ability to attract and retain such personnel 

our ability to maintain and renew existing customer engagements and obtain new business depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highlyskilled technical personnel so as to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with customer demand in particular in order to serve customer needs and grow our business we must attract train and retain appropriate numbers of talented people including project managers it engineers and other senior technical personnel who are able to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences we cannot guarantee that we will be able to train and assimilate new employees successfully in addition we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for professionals with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer we have subcontracted in the past and may continue to 

subcontract in the future with other service providers in order to meet our obligations to our customers if we are unable to attract and retain highlyskilled technical personnel our ability to effectively lead our current projects and develop new business could be jeopardized and our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our services and solutions 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our customers we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important financial opportunity by doing so or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines in addition the contracting practices of our competitors may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become standard in the marketplace if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide services and solutions and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the enforceable terms of our agreements we might face significant legal liability and our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain customer engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify customers or other parties with whom we conduct business with respect to certain matters these arrangements can include provisions whereby we agree to hold the indemnified party and certain of their affiliated entities harmless with respect to thirdparty claims including matters such as our breach of certain representations or covenants our infringement of the intellectual property of others or our gross negligence or willful misconduct payments by us under any of these arrangements are generally conditioned on the customer making a claim and providing us with full control over the defense and settlement of such claim it is not possible to determine our maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement if events arise requiring us to make payment for indemnification claims under our contractual indemnification obligations such payments could have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally our customers may perform audits or require us to perform audits and provide audit reports with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such customers especially when we process data belonging to them our ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit in a timely manner we could also incur liability if our controls and procedures or the controls and procedures we manage for a customer were to result in an internal control failure or impair our customer’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements 

we may face difficulties in providing business solutions or delivering complex and large projects for our customers that could cause customers to discontinue their work with us which in turn could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have been expanding the nature and scope of our engagements and have added new service offerings including digital services the success of these service offerings depends in part upon continued demand for such services by our existing and prospective customers and our ability to meet this demand in a costcompetitive and effective manner to obtain engagements for such solutions or projects we also are more likely to compete with large wellestablished international consulting firms resulting in increased competition and pricing pressure accordingly we cannot be certain that our new service offerings will effectively meet customer needs or that we will be able to attract existing and prospective customers to these service offerings 

the increased breadth of our service offerings has resulted and may continue to result in larger and more complex projects with our customers this requires us to establish closer relationships with our customers and achieve a thorough understanding of their operations our ability to establish such relationships depends on a number of factors including the proficiency of our professionals and our management personnel our failure to understand our customer requirements or our failure to deliver services that meet the requirements specified by our customers could result in termination of customer contracts and we could be liable to our customers for significant penalties or damages which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

larger projects often involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a customer may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements these terminations cancellations or delays may result from factors that have little or nothing to do with the quality of our services such as the business or financial condition of our customers or the economy generally such cancellations or delays make it difficult to plan for project resource requirements and inaccuracies in such resource planning and allocation may have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our customers our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our customers of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our customers and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services actual losses on customer balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our customers macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our customers including limited access to the credit markets insolvency or bankruptcy and as a result could cause customers to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of customer balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our customer balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

if our customers are not satisfied with our services and solutions or if our reputation in the marketplace is damaged our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing customers our business model also depends on our account teams’ ability to develop relationships with our customers that enable us to understand our customers’ needs and deliver services and solutions that are tailored to those needs if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in particular customers that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors 

in addition negative publicity related to our customer services or relationships regardless of its accuracy could adversely affect our business by inhibiting our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective customers our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage due to actions or statements made by current or former customers that are dissatisfied with our services or work product as well as competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators former and current employees members of the investment community and the media damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair make potential or existing customers reluctant to select us for new engagements and in turn result in a loss of business adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts reduce the value and effectiveness of the cognizant brand name and reduce investor confidence in us any one of which could adversely affecting our business results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on third parties for certain software products 

certain of our software products contain components that are developed by third parties in addition we resell certain software products of third parties and we use thirdparty software products to deliver our services and solutions we may not be able to replace the functions provided by these thirdparty software components or products if they become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or with our services and solutions or if they are not adequately maintained or updated any defects in or significant interruption in the availability of these thirdparty software products or components could harm the sale of our products and our delivery of services and solutions to our customers unless and until we can secure or develop an alternative source in addition thirdparty suppliers of software or other intellectual property assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our customers if our ability to provide services and solutions to our customers is impaired as a result of any such denial our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

alternate sources for the technology currently licensed to us may not be available to us in a timely manner may not provide us with the same functions as currently provided to us or may be more expensive than products we currently use further our success depends on our ability to maintain our existing relationships with thirdparty software providers and build new relationships with other providers in order to enhance our services and remain competitive if we are unable to maintain such existing relationships or successfully build new relationships our business results of operations and financial condition could suffer   

we are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio 

any deterioration of the credit and capital markets in the united states europe or other regions of the world could result in volatility of our investment earnings and impairments to our investment portfolio which could negatively impact our financial condition and reported income changes in economic conditions could adversely affect the ability of counterparties including counterparties to our foreign exchange forward contracts to meet their obligations to us 

our revenues are highly dependent on customers concentrated in certain industries including the financial services and healthcare industries consolidation and factors that negatively affect these industries may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

during the year ended december 31 2016  we earned 398  of our revenues from our financial services business segment which includes banking and insurance customers and 287  from our healthcare business segment which includes healthcare and life sciences customers significant consolidation or a decrease in growth in the financial services industry or the healthcare industry may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example two or more of our current customers may merge or consolidate and combine their operations which may cause us to lose work or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies may also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing regulatory economic and political conditions affecting the industries in which we operate we may be unable to effectively plan for or respond to those changes and our business results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected 

our revenues are highly dependent on customers located in the united states and europe any weakening of economic conditions in these markets may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 during the year ended december 31 2016  782  of our revenues were derived from customers located in north america while 159  of our revenues were derived from customers located in europe any weakening of economic conditions in the us or european economies could depress the pricing for our services and cause our customers to reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we do not continue to improve our operational financial and other internal controls and systems to manage our growth and size our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our historic and anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls in particular our growth will increase the challenges involved in 

 in addition the increasing size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that a member of our personnel will engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity breach our contractual obligations or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train our people and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

there can be no assurance that our business results of operations and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of indebtedness 

on november 20 2014 in conjunction with our acquisition of tz us parent inc we entered into a credit agreement with a bank syndicate providing for a 10 billion unsecured term loan and a 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility both of which mature on november 20 2019 we anticipate incurring additional indebtedness in the future in connection with our announced capital return plan which includes an intent to return 34 billion in capital to stockholders during 2017 and 

2018 we will be required to have sufficient cash available in the united states to pay scheduled installments of principal accrued interest and fees from time to time and at maturity if we do not have sufficient cash available in the united states we may be required to repatriate earnings held by our foreign subsidiaries any such repatriation would cause us to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings at that time which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we may not have sufficient cash in the united states or abroad to make payments on our debt obligations which could cause us to seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our existing indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

in addition the credit agreement contains certain covenants including a requirement that we maintain a debt to total stockholders equity ratio not in excess of 040 to 100 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter failure to comply with this covenant or other provisions of the credit agreement could result in a default under the credit agreement requiring us to either cure such default receive a waiver or in the absence of such cure or waiver refinance any outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement there is no assurance that we would be able to refinance our debt on acceptable terms and conditions 

we may not be able to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock in accordance with our announced intent or at all 

we have announced a plan to return 34 billion to stockholders over the next two years through a combination of stock repurchases and cash dividends as part of this plan we have indicated that we expect to commence a 15 billion accelerated stock repurchase program in the first quarter of 2017 initiate a regular quarterly cash dividend of 015 per share commencing in the second quarter of 2017 and repurchase stock of 12 billion in the open market during 2017 and 2018 we have also announced that we intend to return to stockholders approximately 75 of our us free cash flow defined as net cash provided from operating activities of our us operating subsidiaries less cash purchases of property and equipment by our us operating subsidiaries in 2019 and beyond through a combination of cash dividends and stock repurchases we have also indicated that our board of directors intends to continue to review the capital return plan for potential future increases including through an increase in the dividend subject to our financial performance economic outlook and any other relevant considerations 

the board of directors’ determinations regarding dividends and share repurchases will depend on a variety of factors including our cash and investment balances in the united states net income cash flow generated from operations or other sources in the united states and elsewhere overall liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results there can be no guarantee that we will achieve our announced capital return plan in the amounts or on the expected time frame that we have indicated or at all our ability to declare future dividends will depend on our future financial performance which in turn depends on the successful implementation of our strategy and on financial competitive regulatory technical and other factors general economic conditions demand and selling prices for our services and other factors specific to our industry or specific projects many of which are beyond our control therefore our ability to generate cash flow depends on the performance of our operations and could be limited by decreases in our profitability or increases in costs regulatory changes capital expenditures or debt servicing requirements 

any failure to achieve our announced capital return plan could negatively impact our reputation harm investor confidence in us and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

risks relating to our international operations 

our global operations are subject to complex risks some of which might be beyond our control 

we have offices and operations in various countries around the world and provide services to customers globally in 2016  782  of our revenues were attributable to the north american region 159  were attributable to the european region and the remainder was attributable to the rest of the world primarily the asia pacific region we anticipate that revenues from customers outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence particularly in europe the asia pacific region and the latin america region 

in addition the majority of our employees and global delivery centers are located in india as a result we may be subject to risks inherently associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations difficulties in enforcing intellectual property andor contractual rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable international hostilities terrorism and natural disasters we may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations as well as integrating employees that we 

hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india and we are subject to regulatory economic political and other uncertainties in india 

we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india where a majority of our technical professionals are located while wage costs are lower in india than in the united states and other developed countries for comparably skilled professionals wages in india have historically increased at a faster rate than in the united states and other countries in which we operate if this trend continues in the future it would result in increased costs for our skilled professionals and thereby potentially reduce our operating margins also there is no assurance that in future periods competition for skilled professionals will not drive salaries higher in india thereby resulting in increased costs for our technical professionals and reduced operating margins 

india has also recently experienced civil unrest and terrorism and has been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries in recent years there have been military confrontations between india and pakistan that have occurred in the region of kashmir and along the indiapakistan border the potential for hostilities between the two countries has been high in light of tensions related to recent terrorist incidents in india and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment including events in and related to afghanistan iraq and syria if india becomes engaged in armed hostilities particularly if these hostilities are protracted or involve the threat of or use of weapons of mass destruction it is likely that our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 

in the past the indian economy has experienced many of the problems that commonly confront the economies of developing countries including high inflation erratic gross domestic product growth and shortages of foreign exchange the indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy and indian government actions concerning the economy could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities like us in the past the indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy including the software development services industry changes in government leadership in india or a change in policies of the existing government in india that results in the elimination of any of the benefits realized by us from our indian operations or the imposition of new taxes applicable to such operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the indian rupee and other foreign currency exchange rates restrictions on the deployment of cash across our global operations and our use of derivative financial instruments 

although we report our operating results in us dollars a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues income from operations net income and the value of balance sheet items originally denominated in other currencies there is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations in addition in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which could limit our ability to use these funds across our global operations further as we leverage our global delivery model a portion of our expenses is incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee against the us dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain rupee denominated payments in india these contracts are intended to partially offset the impact of the movement of the exchange rates on future operating costs in addition we have also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign currency denominated net monetary assets the hedging strategies that we have implemented or may in the future implement to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market operational and counterparty credit risks accordingly we may incur losses from our use of derivative financial instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violations of these regulations could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

because we provide services to customers throughout the world we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal rules on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations violations of these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business damage to our reputation and other unintended consequences such as liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

among other anticorruption laws and regulations we are subject to the fcpa which prohibits improper payments or offers of improper payments to foreign officials to obtain business or any other benefit and the uk bribery act violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions including fines and suspension or disqualification from government contracting or contracting with private entities in certain highly regulated industries any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

international hostilities terrorist activities other violence or war natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could delay or reduce the number of new service orders we receive and impair our ability to service our customers thereby adversely affecting our business results of operations and financial condition 

hostilities involving acts of terrorism violence or war natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat or perceived potential for these events could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to provide services to our customers such events may cause customers to delay their decisions on spending for information technology consulting and business process services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our personnel and to our and our customers’ physical facilities and operations around the world additionally by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to some or all of our customers the majority of our employees are located in india and the vast majority of our technical professionals in the united states and europe are indian nationals who are able to work in the united states and europe only because they hold current visas and work permits any inability to travel could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs and expenses or could impair our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities could also adversely affect our ability to serve our customers 

hostilities involving the united states the united kingdom india and other countries in which we provide services to our customers and other acts of terrorism violence or war natural disasters global health risks or pandemics may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues if we fail to defend against any of these occurrences we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our customers our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the results of the united kingdom’s referendum on withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum or brexit referendum the brexit referendum was advisory and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the united kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process which the uk government has indicated that it intends to commence in the near future the brexit referendum has created political and economic uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union and as to whether any other european countries may similarly seek to exit the european union as we have material operations in the united kingdom and the rest of europe and our global operations serve many customers with significant operations in those regions our financial condition and results of operation may be impacted by such uncertainty 

for the year ended december 31 2016 revenues from our customers in the united kingdom and rest of europe represented 87  and 72  respectively of our consolidated revenues a significant portion of our revenues from customers in the united kingdom is generated in british pounds this exposure subjects us to revenue risk with respect to our customers in the united kingdom as well as to risk resulting from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates in addition for 

the year ended december 31 2016 revenues from our financial services customers represented 398  of our consolidated revenues uncertainty regarding future united kingdom financial laws and regulations the withdrawal terms of the united kingdom from the european union and the future trade terms between the united kingdom and the european union could negatively impact the financial services sector including our customers in such sector and as a consequence adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations further it is uncertain what impact the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union will have on general economic conditions in the united kingdom the european union and globally any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to taxes 

our earnings and financial condition may be negatively impacted by certain tax related matters 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in accounting principles or interpretations and changes in tax laws certain jurisdictions including the united states are actively contemplating tax reform and tax policy changes any of these changes could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods in addition our income tax returns are subject to examination in the jurisdictions in which we operate we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these examinations may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate foreign earnings or if such earnings become subject to us tax on a current basis 

we earn a significant amount of our earnings outside of the united states other than amounts for which we have already accrued us taxes we consider foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur that could effectively force us to change our intent not to repatriate such earnings if such earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states or if legislation is enacted in the united states providing for a tax on foreign earnings or profits prior to their repatriation we may have to accrue taxes associated with such earnings or profits at a substantially higher rate which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our earnings may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided by india to companies in our industry as well as by possible changes in indian tax laws 

our indian subsidiaries collectively referred to as cognizant india are primarily exportoriented and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the indian government for export activities conducted within special economic zones or sezs for periods of up to 15 years the indian government has announced a plan to phase out certain tax exemptions and deductions which includes a discontinuation of tax holidays for new sez units commencing operations on or after april 1 2020 and a phased reduction of the current indian corporate income tax rate these changes or any changes that would reduce or deny sez tax benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition all indian profits including those generated within sezs are subject to the minimum alternative tax or mat at the rate of 213 any mat paid is creditable against future corporate income tax subject to limitations currently we anticipate utilizing our existing mat balances against future corporate income tax our ability to fully do so may be influenced by possible changes to the indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of cognizant india our potential inability to fully utilize our deferred income tax assets related to the mat could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating to intellectual property 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other valuable ip we presently hold a limited number of issued patents and we have filed and intend to file patent applications there is no guarantee that any patents will issue in the united states or in any other country we may seek protection or that they will serve as a barrier from competition from other organizations additionally the protection afforded by international patent laws as well as the enforcement actions differ from country to country there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain adequate protection or enforcement of our ip rights 

we also rely upon a combination of copyright and trade secret laws nondisclosure and related contractual arrangements and other security measures to protect our ip rights we believe that laws rules regulations and treaties in effect in the united states india and other countries in which we operate are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our ip however there can be no assurance that these laws will not change in ways that may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components libraries toolsets and other technology or data we use in the performance of our services and existing laws of some countries in which we provide services such as china might offer only limited protection of our ip rights there also can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our ip rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use of our ip 

unauthorized use of our ip may result in development of technology products or services that compete with our products and services and unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products services or proprietary information if we are unable to protect our ip our business may be adversely affected and our ability to compete may be impaired 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific customer greater rights in ip developed or used in connection with a contract than we normally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of ip we create and intend to reuse across multiple customer engagements which would limit our ability to reuse that ip for other customers any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

our ability to enforce our software license agreements service agreements and other ip rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries to the extent that we seek to enforce our rights we could be subject to claims that an ip right is invalid otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are pursuing a claim in addition our assertion of ip rights may result in the other party seeking to assert alleged ip rights or assert other claims against us which could harm our business if we are not successful in defending such claims in litigation we may not be able to sell or license a particular service or solution due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations in addition governments may adopt regulations or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others or governments may require that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our ip rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the ip rights of others and we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty ip rights 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our customers do not infringe on the ip rights of others third parties may assert against us or our customers claims alleging infringement of patent copyright trademark or other intellectual property rights to technologies or services that are important to our business infringement claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions in our contracts we generally agree to indemnify our customers for certain expenses or liabilities resulting from potential infringement of the ip rights of third parties in some instances the amount of our liability under these indemnities could be substantial any claims that our products services or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims may result in significant costs in defending and resolving such claims and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business in addition as a result of such ip infringement claims we could be required or otherwise decide that it is appropriate to 

 the occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets which would reduce the value of our assets and increase expenses in addition if we alter or discontinue our offering of affected items or services our revenues could be affected if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our customers an injunction might be ordered against our customer or our own services or operations causing further damages 

we expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our competitors are able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights for software products and methods technological solutions and processes we may be subject to ip infringement claims from certain individuals or companies that have acquired patent portfolios for the primary purpose of asserting such claims against other companies the risk of infringement claims against us may also increase as we continue to 

develop and license our ip to our customers and other third parties any infringement claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating to legislation and government regulation 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted and negative perceptions associated with offshore outsourcing could impair our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in the united states which is our largest market as well as in europe the asia pacific and other regions in which we have customers for example a number of measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by us companies have been put forward for consideration by the us congress and in various state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs domestically further the current us administration or congress may seek to limit outsourcing by us companies if enacted such measures may broaden existing restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly or impact private industry with measures that include tax disincentives fees or penalties intellectual property transfer restrictions mandatory government audit requirements and new standards that have the effect of restricting the use of certain business andor work visas in the event that any of these measures become law our ability to provide services to our customers could be impaired which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition existing and future legislative and administrativeregulatory policies restricting the performance of business process services from an offshore location in jurisdictions in europe the asia pacific or any other region in which we have customers could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as domestic job loss and theft and misappropriation of sensitive customer data particularly involving service providers in india current or prospective customers may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from utilizing global service delivery providers due to negative perceptions that may be associated with using global service delivery models or firms any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward global service delivery would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide the majority of their services from within the country in which our customers operate 

restrictions on immigration may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to customers which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline 

our future success continues to depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills including those from developing countries especially india the ability of foreign nationals to work in the united states europe the asia pacific and other regions in which we have customers depends on their and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits for our personnel who need to travel internationally if we are unable to obtain such visas or work permits or if their issuance is delayed or if their length is shortened we may not be able to provide services to our customers or to continue to provide services on a timely and costeffective basis receive revenues as early as expected or manage our delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the countries in which we have customers are subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement for example the us congress has been actively considering various proposals that would make extensive changes to us immigration laws regarding the admission of highskilled temporary and permanent workers further the current us administration or congress may seek to limit the admission of highskilled temporary and permanent workers and has issued and may continue to issue executive orders designed to limit immigration any such provisions may increase our cost of doing business in the united states and may discourage customers from seeking our services our international expansion strategy and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed 

 increased regulation of the financial services industry healthcare industry or other industries in which our customers operate could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

the industries in which our customers are concentrated such as the financial services industry and the healthcare industry are or may be increasingly subject to governmental regulation and intervention for instance the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a provider of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by a number of regulatory agencies these agencies regulate the services we provide and manner in which we operate for example some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required our business may be harmed in addition customers in the financial services sector have been subject to increased regulation following the enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in the united states new or changing regulations under doddfrank as well as other regulations or legislation affecting our customers in the financial services industry may reduce demand for our services or cause us to incur costly changes in our processes or personnel thereby negatively affecting our business results of operations and financial condition 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the federal state and local levels and is subject to changing legislative regulatory political and other influences particularly in light of uncertainties posed by the result of the recent presidential election in the united states many healthcare laws such as the affordable care act are complex subject to frequent change and dependent on interpretation and enforcement decisions from government agencies with broad discretion the application of these laws to us our customers or the specific services and relationships we have with our customers is not always clear our failure to anticipate accurately any changes to or the repeal of the affordable care act and similar or future laws and regulations or our failure to comply with them could create liability for us result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition further the growth of our business results of operations and financial condition rely in part on customers in the healthcare industry that receive substantial revenues from governmental and other thirdparty payer programs a reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs a change in allocation methodologies or the termination of our customers’ government contracts could negatively affect our customers’ businesses and in turn negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition in addition as a service provider to customers who are government contractors we may in the future become involved in governmental investigations to evaluate our or our customers’ compliance with government healthcare programs which could result in the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased regulation changes in existing regulation or increased government intervention in the other industries in which our customers operate also may adversely affect the growth of their respective businesses and therefore negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating to our common stock and governing documents 

our stock price continues to be volatile 

our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline 

provisions in our charter and bylaws and provisions under delaware law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals 

provisions in our charter and bylaws each as amended and delaware general corporate law or dgcl may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover proposals or delaying or preventing changes in our control or management including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices these provisions include 



 these provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock

 item 2 properties 

to support our planned growth we are continually expanding our global delivery center capacity through the construction of new facilities supplemented by additional leasing of nonowned facilities as presented in the table below as of december 31 2016  we leased 120  million square feet and owned 138  million square feet related to our global delivery centers located in 31  countries and used to deliver services to our customers across all four of our business segments

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are conducting an internal investigation focused on whether certain payments relating to companyowned facilities in india were made improperly and in possible violation of the fcpa and other applicable laws in september 2016 we voluntarily notified the doj and sec and are cooperating fully with both agencies the investigation is being conducted under the oversight of the audit committee with the assistance of outside counsel to date the investigation has identified a total of approximately 6 million in payments made between 2010 and 2015 that may have been improper based on the results of the investigation to date no material adjustments restatements or other revisions to our previously issued financial statements are required 

on october 5 2016 and october 27 2016 two putative securities class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the district of new jersey on behalf of a putative class of stockholders who purchased our common stock during the period between february 25 2016 and september 30 2016 on november 18 2016 a different plaintiff filed a third putative securities class action complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey on behalf of a putative class of stockholders who purchased our common stock during the period between february 27 2015 and september 30 2016 the complaints collectively name us and certain of our current and former officers as defendants and allege violations of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended based on allegedly false or misleading statements related to potential violations of the fcpa our business prospects and operations and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures the plaintiffs collectively seek awards of compensatory damages among 

other relief and their costs and attorneys’ and experts’ fees the united states district court for the district of new jersey issued an order dated february 3 2017 consolidating the three putative securities class actions 

on october 31 2016 november 15 2016 and november 18 2016 three putative shareholder derivative complaints were filed in new jersey superior court bergen county naming us all of our directors and certain of our current and former officers as defendants on january 24 2017 the new jersey superior court bergen county consolidated the three putative shareholder derivative actions filed in that court the complaints assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty corporate waste unjust enrichment abuse of control mismanagement andor insider selling by defendants on february 22 2017 a fourth putative shareholder derivative complaint asserting similar claims was filed in the united states district court for the district of new jersey naming us and certain of our directors as defendants the complaints allege among other things that certain of our public disclosures were false and misleading by failing to disclose that payments allegedly in violation of the fcpa had been made and by asserting that management had determined that our internal controls were effective the plaintiffs seek awards of compensatory damages and restitution to us as a result of the alleged violations and their costs and attorneys’ fees experts’ fees and other litigation expenses among other relief 

we are presently unable to predict the duration scope or result of the audit committee’s investigation any investigations by the doj or the sec the consolidated putative securities class action the consolidated putative shareholder derivative action or any other lawsuits the doj and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations including injunctive relief disgorgement fines penalties modifications to business practices including the termination or modification of existing business relationships the imposition of compliance programs and the retention of a monitor to oversee compliance with the fcpa we expect to incur additional expenses related to fines or to remedial measures the imposition of any of these sanctions or remedial measures could have a material adverse effect on our business annual and interim results of operations cash flows and financial condition furthermore while the company intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously these lawsuits and any other related lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties the actual cost of such litigation will depend upon many unknown factors and the outcome of the litigation is necessarily uncertain 

we are also involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of our management the outcome of such claims and legal actions if decided adversely is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results cash flows or consolidated financial position

the following table sets forth a summary of our financial results for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  



the key drivers of our revenue growth in 2016  as compared to 2015 were as follows 

 our customers seek to meet a dual mandate of achieving more efficient and effective operations while investing in digital technologies that are reshaping their business models increasingly the relative emphasis among our customers is shifting towards investment and innovation as reflected in accelerated demand for our digital services we also saw an increase in demand for larger more complex projects that are transformational for our customers including managed services contracts such contracts may have longer sales cycles and rampup periods and could lead to greater variability in our period to period operating results we increased the number of strategic customers by 29  during the year bringing the total number of our strategic customers to 329  we define a strategic customer as one offering the potential to generate at least 5 million to 50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity 

 



in 2016  our operating margin decreased to 170  from 173 in 2015  while our nongaap operating margin decreased to 195 3  from 197 3  in 2015  the decreases in both our gaap and nongaap operating margins were due to increases in compensation and benefit costs excluding incentivebased compensation and increases in certain professional service costs partially offset by the impact of lower incentivebased compensation in 2016 the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar and realized gains on settlement of cash flow hedges in 2016 as compared to losses in 2015 

in may 2016 india enacted the finance bill 2016 that among other things expanded the applicability of india’s buyback distribution tax to certain share buyback transactions occurring after june 1 2016 in midmay prior to the june 1 effective date of the enactment our principal operating subsidiary in india repurchased shares from its shareholders which are nonindian cognizant entities valued at 28 billion this transaction or the india cash remittance was undertaken pursuant to a plan approved by the high court of madras and simplified the shareholding structure of our principal operating subsidiary in india pursuant to the transaction our principal indian operating subsidiary repurchased approximately 12 billion of the total 28 billion of shares from its us shareholders resulting in incremental tax expense while the remaining 16 billion was repurchased from its shareholder outside the united states net of taxes the transaction resulted in a remittance of cash to the united states in the amount of 10 billion as a result of this transaction we incurred an incremental 2016 income tax expense of 238 million 

as previously disclosed the company is conducting an internal investigation focused on whether certain payments relating to companyowned facilities in india were made improperly and in possible violation of the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and other applicable laws in september 2016 we voluntarily notified the department of justice or doj and the securities and exchange commission or sec and are cooperating fully with both agencies the investigation is being conducted under the oversight of the audit committee with the assistance of outside counsel to date the investigation has identified a total of approximately 6 million in payments made between 2010 and 2015 that may have been recorded improperly in 2016 we recorded an outofperiod correction related to 4 million of such payments that were previously capitalized that should have been expensed the recorded correction resulted in an increase of selling general and administrative expenses of 4 million a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of 1 million and a reduction in property and equipment net of 3 million these outofperiod corrections and the other 2 million in potentially improper payments were not material to any previously issued annual or interim financial statements and are not material to the financial results for the year ending december 31 2016 based on the results of the investigation to date the members of senior management who may have participated in or been aware of the making of the identified potentially improper payments and failed to take action to prevent the making of the identified potentially improper payments are no longer with the company or in a senior management position 

in october and november 2016 three putative securities class action complaints were filed naming us and certain of our current and former officers as defendants and alleging violations of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended based on allegedly false or misleading statements related to potential violations of the fcpa our business prospects and operations and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures the plaintiffs collectively seek awards of compensatory damages among other relief and their costs and attorneys’ and experts’ fees in february 2017 the three putative securities class actions were consolidated by the court 

additionally in october and november 2016 three putative shareholder derivative complaints were filed naming us all of our directors and certain of our current and former officers as defendants in january 2017 the three putative shareholder derivative actions were consolidated by the court the complaints assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty corporate waste unjust enrichment abuse of control mismanagement andor insider selling by defendants in february 2017 a fourth putative shareholder derivative complaint asserting similar claims was filed naming us and certain of our directors as defendants the complaints allege among other things that certain of our public disclosures were false and misleading by failing to disclose that payments allegedly in violation of the fcpa had been made and by asserting that management had determined that our internal controls were effective the plaintiffs seek awards of compensatory damages and restitution to us as a result of the alleged violations and their costs and attorneys’ fees experts’ fees and other litigation expenses among other relief see the section titled part i item 3 legal proceedings 

in 2016 we incurred 27 million in costs related to the fcpa investigation and related lawsuits we expect to continue to incur expenses related to these matters in 2017 and future periods 

 



we finished the year with approximately 260200  employees which is an increase of approximately 38500  over the prior year end the increase in the number of our service delivery staff and the related infrastructure costs to meet the demand for our services is the primary driver of the increase in our operating expenses in 2016  annualized turnover including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 156  for the three months ended december 31 2016  the majority of our turnover occurs in india as a result annualized attrition rates onsite at customers are below our global attrition rate in addition attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff 

during 2017  barring any unforeseen events we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results 

 in response to this environment we plan to 



business segments 

our four reportable business segments are 

 our chief operating decision maker evaluates cognizant’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors 

pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenues and operating expenses to different degrees expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the global delivery centers certain selling general and administrative expenses excess or shortfall of incentive compensation for delivery personnel as compared to target stockbased compensation expense a portion of depreciation and amortization and the impact of the settlements of our cash flow hedges are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker accordingly such expenses are excluded from segment operating profit 

we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for that segment however no individual customer accounted for sales in excess of 10 of our consolidated revenues during 2016  2015  or 2014  in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and we believe that a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues 

 results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2016   

the following table sets forth certain financial data for the three years ended december 31 2016  

 

 revenues  overall  revenues increased by 86  to 13487 million  during 2016  as compared to an increase of 210 to 12416 million in 2015  the increase in revenues in 2016  was primarily attributed to services related to the integration of digital technologies that are reshaping our customers business and operating models increased customer spending on discretionary projects continued interest in using our global delivery model as a means to reduce overall technology and operations costs and continued penetration in all our geographic markets in 2015  revenues included 724 million from tz us parent inc or trizetto which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 80 million in 2014 the increase in trizetto revenues represented 299 of the year over year revenue growth in 2015 the remaining 2015 increase was primarily attributed to greater acceptance of our global delivery model among an increasing number of industries continued interest in using our global delivery model as a means to reduce overall technology and operations costs increased customer spending on

nongaap financial measures   

portions of our disclosure including the following table include nongaap income from operations nongaap 

operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share these nongaap financial measures are not based on any 

comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial 

measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies in 

addition these nongaap measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with 

gaap the reconciliations of cognizant’s nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures should be 

carefully evaluated 

our nongaap income from operations and nongaap operating margin exclude stockbased compensation expense 

and acquisitionrelated charges our definition of nongaap diluted earnings per share excludes net nonoperating foreign 

currency exchange gains or losses and for the year ended december 31 2016 the impact of a onetime incremental income tax expense related to the india cash remittance in addition to excluding stockbased compensation expense and acquisitionrelated charges our nongaap diluted earnings per share is additionally adjusted for the income tax impact of the above items as applicable the income tax impact of each item is calculated by applying the statutory rate and local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred 

we believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the company provides enhanced transparency into the operating results of the company for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes we use nongaap financial information that does not include as applicable stockbased compensation expense acquisitionrelated 

charges net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses and the impact of a onetime incremental income tax expense related to the india cash remittance for financial and operational decision making to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons to determine portions of the compensation for our executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors therefore it is our belief that the use of nongaap financial measures excluding these costs provides a meaningful supplemental measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance accordingly we believe that the presentation of nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share when read in conjunction with our reported gaap results can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 

a limitation of using nongaap financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap is 

that nongaap measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance 

with gaap and exclude costs that are recurring namely stockbased compensation expense certain acquisitionrelated 

charges and net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses in addition other companies may calculate non 

gaap financial measures differently than us thereby limiting the usefulness of these nongaap financial measures as a 

comparative tool we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts 

excluded from nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share to 

allow investors to evaluate such nongaap financial measures 

the following table presents a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to the most comparable gaap measure for the years ended december 31 



 

 the nongaap income tax benefits related to acquisitionrelated charges were 46 million  43 million and 13 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 



liquidity and capital resources 

our cash generated from operations has historically been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to grow our business in addition as of december 31 2016  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 5169  million and additional available capacity under our revolving credit facility of approximately 750 million the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the three years ended december 31 



operating activities the decrease in operating cash flow for 2016  compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to the decrease in net income which includes the impact of incremental taxes paid in connection with the india cash remittance and higher incentive based compensation payments in 2016 as compared to 2015 the increase in operating cash flow for 2015 was primarily attributed to the increase in net income further impacted by the increase in noncash expenses and higher incentivebased compensation accruals that were paid in the first quarter of 2016 trade accounts receivable increased to 2556 million  at december 31 2016  as compared to 2253 million at december 31 2015  and 1969 million at december 31 2014  unbilled accounts receivable were 349 million  at december 31 2016  369 million at december 31 2015  and 325 million at december 31 2014  the increase in trade accounts receivable during 2016  was primarily due to increased revenues 

we monitor turnover aging and the collection of accounts receivable by customer our days sales outstanding calculation includes billed and unbilled accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts reduced by the uncollected portion of our deferred revenue our days sales outstanding was 72 days as of december 31 2016  70 days as of december 31 2015 and 70 days as of december 31 2014 

investing activities  the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2016  compared to 2015 is due to lower net purchases of investments partially offset by higher payments for acquisitions and equity and cost method investments in 2015  the reduction in net cash used when compared to 2014  was primarily due to lower payments for acquisitions as we acquired trizetto in 2014 partially offset by greater net purchases of investments and higher outflows for capital expenditures in 2015 

financing activities  the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2016  compared to 2015  is primarily attributable to higher net repayments of debt and an increase in stock repurchases in 2015 we had net outflows from financing activities primarily due to our net repayments of debt and greater stock repurchases as compared to net cash inflows from financing activities in 2014 driven by our net borrowings under the credit agreement 

in 2014 we entered into a credit agreement with a commercial bank syndicate or the credit agreement providing for a 1000 million unsecured term loan and a 750 million revolving credit facility the term loan was used to pay a portion of the cash consideration in connection with our acquisition of trizetto the revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes the term loan and the revolving credit facility both mature on november 20 2019 as of december 31 2016  we had 881 million  outstanding under the term loan and no  outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility 

the credit agreement contains certain negative covenants including limitations on liens mergers consolidations and acquisitions subsidiary indebtedness and affiliate transactions as well as certain affirmative covenants in addition the credit agreement requires us to maintain a debt to total stockholders equity ratio not in excess of 040 to 100 as of december 31 2016  we are in compliance with our debt covenants and have provided a quarterly certification to our lenders to that effect we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the credit agreement to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the remaining available capacity under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2016  and through the date of this filing 

on november 5 2016 or the first amendment effective date we entered into amendment no 1 and limited waiver no 1 to the credit agreement or the first amendment the first amendment modifies the representation and warranty in the credit agreement relating to compliance with anticorruption laws to add an exception for actions proceedings and other matters relating to our internal investigation into whether certain payments relating to our owned facilities in india were made improperly and in possible violation of the fcpa and other applicable laws or the disclosed matters pursuant to the first amendment the required lenders waived certain defaults or events of default that may have existed prior to the first 

amendment effective date due to such representation and warranty proving to have been materially incorrect solely as a result of the disclosed matters and due to our failure to provide notice thereof to the administrative agent 

we have announced a plan to return 34 billion to stockholders over the next two years through a combination of stock repurchases and cash dividends as part of this plan we expect to commence a 15 billion accelerated stock repurchase program in the first quarter of 2017 initiate a regular quarterly cash dividend of 015 per share commencing in the second quarter of 2017 and repurchase stock of 12 billion in the open market during 2017 and 2018 we also plan to return to stockholders approximately 75 of our us free cash flow defined as net cash provided from operating activities of our us operating subsidiaries less cash purchases of property and equipment by our us operating subsidiaries in 2019 and beyond through a combination of stock repurchases and cash dividends stock repurchases may be made from time to time through openmarket purchases and through the use of rule 10b51 plans andor by other means 

our board of directors intends to continue to review the capital return plan considering our financial performance economic outlook regulatory changes and any other relevant factors the board of directors’ determinations regarding dividends and share repurchases will depend on a variety of factors including our net income cash flow generated from operations or other sources liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results as these factors may change over the course of the year the amount of stock repurchase activity and actual amount of dividends declared by our board of directors if any during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time there can be no guarantee that we will achieve our announced capital return plan in the amounts or on the expected time frame that we have indicated or at all 

we believe the combination of our us cash on hand us cash flows and ability to borrow under both existing and future debt arrangements continues to be sufficient to fund our current domestic operations and obligations including debt service and future share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends the amount of funds held in us tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business including debt repayments and due to other reasons such as acquisitionrelated activities the company’s us operations historically have generated and are expected to continue to generate substantial cash flows in circumstances where the company has additional cash requirements in the united states we have several additional liquidity options available to meet those requirements these options may include borrowing additional funds including borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility or a new syndicated lending facility should we seek one temporarily utilizing intercompany loans with certain foreign subsidiaries on a limited basis and repatriating certain of our foreign earnings additionally we believe we have access to the credit and equity markets and could borrow additional funds under acceptable terms and conditions or raise additional capital through an equity transaction 

in may 2016 india enacted the finance bill 2016 that among other things expanded the applicability of india’s buyback distribution tax to certain share buyback transactions occurring after june 1 2016 in midmay prior to the june 1 effective date of the enactment our principal operating subsidiary in india repurchased shares from its shareholders which are nonindian cognizant entities valued at 28 billion pursuant to the transaction our principal indian operating subsidiary repurchased approximately 12 billion of the total 28 billion of shares from its us shareholders resulting in incremental tax expense while the remaining 16 billion was repurchased from its shareholder outside the united states net of taxes the transaction resulted in a remittance of cash to the united states in the amount of 10 billion 

many of our operations are conducted outside the united states and significant portions of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are held internationally as of december 31 2016  4029 million  of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held outside the united states as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows and cash balances we utilize certain strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to income taxes in the united states less applicable foreign tax credits other than amounts affected by the india cash remittance and amounts for which we have already accrued us taxes we intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these amounts to fund our liquidity needs in the united states in reaching this conclusion we considered the onetime nature of the india cash remittance our capital needs in the united states the available sources of liquidity in the united states and our growth plans outside the united states however future events may occur such as material changes in cash estimates discretionary transactions including corporate restructurings and changes in applicable laws which may lead us to repatriate foreign earnings this may result in an additional provision for income taxes which could materially affect our future effective income tax rate due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation 

we expect our operating cash flow cash and investment balances and available capacity under our revolving credit facility to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months our ability to expand and grow our 

business in accordance with current plans to make acquisitions and form joint ventures to meet our longterm capital requirements and to execute our announced capital return plan beyond a twelve month period will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock our continued intent not to repatriate foreign earnings and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we cannot be certain that additional financing if required will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all

we are presently unable to predict the duration scope or result of the internal investigation any investigations by the doj or the sec the consolidated putative securities class action the consolidated putative shareholder derivative action or any other lawsuits as such we are presently unable to develop a reasonable estimate of a possible loss or range of losses if any and thus have not recorded any accruals related to these matters the doj and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations including injunctive relief disgorgement fines penalties modifications to business practices including the termination or modification of existing business relationships the imposition of compliance programs and the retention of a monitor to oversee compliance with the fcpa we expect to incur additional expenses related to fines or to remedial measures furthermore while the company intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously these lawsuits and any other lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties the actual cost of such litigation will depend upon many unknown factors and the outcome of the litigation is necessarily uncertain as such these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business annual or interim results of operations cash flows or our financial condition 

many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our customers including any breach involving a customer’s confidential information or sensitive data or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our services there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover all types of claims continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed or are not covered by our insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain customer engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify customers or other parties with whom we conduct business with respect to certain matters these arrangements can include provisions whereby we agree to hold the indemnified party and certain of their affiliated entities harmless with respect to thirdparty claims related to such matters as our breach of certain representations or covenants our intellectual property infringement our gross negligence or willful misconduct or certain other claims made against certain parties payments by us under any of these arrangements are generally conditioned on the customer making a claim and providing us with full control over the defense and settlement of such claim it is not possible to determine the maximum potential liability under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically we have not made payments under these indemnification agreements and therefore they have not had any impact on our operating results financial position or cash flows however if events arise requiring us to make payment for indemnification claims under our indemnification obligations in contracts we have entered such payments could have material impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company has indemnification and expense advancement obligations pursuant to its bylaws and indemnification agreements with respect to certain current and former members of senior management and the company’s directors in connection with the ongoing internal investigation the company has received requests under such indemnification agreements and its bylaws to provide advances of funds for legal fees and other expenses and expects additional requests in connection with the investigation and related litigation the company has not recorded any liability for these matters as of december 31 2016 as it cannot estimate the ultimate outcome at this time but has expensed advances made through december 31 2016 the company has maintained directors and officers insurance from which a portion of these expenses may be recoverable though we have not recorded an insurance receivable as of december 31 2016 we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period related to the indemnification agreements described here 

foreign currency risk 

overall we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as 782  of our revenues during 2016  were generated from customers located in north america revenues from our customers in the united kingdom rest of europe and rest of world represented 87  72  and 59  respectively of our 2016  revenues accordingly our operating results outside the united states may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates primarily the british pound and the euro as compared to the us dollar in particular the results of the brexit referendum and its effect on the british pound may subject us to increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rate movements 

a portion of our costs in india representing approximately 225  of our global operating costs during 2016  are denominated in the indian rupee and are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations in addition a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may result in nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement in 2016  we reported foreign currency exchange losses exclusive of hedging gains or losses of approximately 27  million which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to certain currencies primarily the indian rupee in our foreign subsidiaries 

we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses these foreign exchange forward contracts to buy indian rupees and sell us dollars are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs in 2016  we reported net gains of 17 million  on contracts that settled during the year as of december 31 2016  we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of 2340 million  and weighted average contract rate of 723  indian rupees to the us dollar these contracts are scheduled to mature as follows 



our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk for transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary these contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2017  that are used to hedge our foreign currency denominated net monetary assets at december 31 2016  the notional value of the outstanding contracts was 213 million  and the related fair value was a liability of 4 million  during 2016  inclusive of losses of 3 million  on our undesignated balance sheet hedges we reported net foreign currency exchange losses of approximately 30  million 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than our foreign exchange forward contracts there were no offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2016  2015  and 2014  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

effects of inflation 

our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals in certain regions competition for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation as with other service providers in our industry we must adequately anticipate wage increases particularly on our fixedprice contracts historically we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation in india however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future 

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap we base our estimates on historical experience current trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared we evaluate our estimates on a continuous basis however the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial statements as they require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain changes to these estimates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenues related to our highly complex application development contracts which are predominantly fixedprice contracts and certain other fixedprice contracts are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method and the proportional performance method of accounting respectively under the percentage of completion method total contract revenues during the term of an agreement are recognized based on the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost cost to cost method under the proportional performance method total contract revenues are recognized based on the level of effort to date in relation to total expected efforts provided to the customer management reviews the assumptions related to these methods on an ongoing basis revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and such losses are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations changes in estimates related to our revenue contracts and contract losses were immaterial for the periods presented 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating the financial condition and relative creditworthiness of each customer historical collections experience and other information including the aging of the receivables 

income taxes  determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and related valuation allowance if any and liabilities requires significant judgment we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate the consolidated provision for income taxes may also change period to period based on nonrecurring events such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of reserves established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related interest which may require us to apply judgment to complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit to the extent that the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies if it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred income tax asset will not be realized a valuation allowance is provided in the event we change our determination as to the amount of deferred income tax assets that can be realized we will adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact recorded to our provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our indian subsidiaries collectively referred to as cognizant india are primarily exportoriented companies and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the government of india for export activities conducted within sezs for periods of up to 15 years a majority of our sez income tax holiday benefits are currently scheduled to expire in whole or in part during the years 2017 to 2027 and may be extended on a limited basis for an additional five years per unit if certain reinvestment criteria are met we have constructed and expect to continue to operate most of our newer development facilities in sezs our indian profits ineligible for sez benefits are subject to corporate income tax at the rate of 346 in addition all indian profits including those generated within sezs are subject to the mat at the rate of 213 any mat paid is creditable against future indian corporate income tax subject to limitations currently we anticipate utilizing our existing mat balances against our future corporate income tax obligations in india however our ability to do so could be impacted by possible changes to the indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of cognizant india 

stockbased compensation  stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised the expected volatility of our stock and the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited in addition for performance stock units we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period to the extent that actual results differ significantly from our estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

derivative financial instruments  derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date our derivative financial instruments consist of foreign exchange forward contracts we estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange forward contract by using a present value of expected cash flows model this model utilizes various assumptions including timing and amounts of cash flows discount rates and counterparty credit risk factors the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

investments  our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of time deposits mutual funds invested in fixed income securities and corporate bonds municipal bonds certificates of deposit commercial paper debt issuances by the us government us government agencies foreign governments and supranational entities and assetbacked securities the assetbacked securities included government national mortgage association gnma mortgage backed securities and securities backed by auto loans credit card receivables and other receivables the years of issuance of our assetbacked securities fall primarily in the 2012 to 2016 range 

we utilize various inputs to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio to the extent they exist unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets level 1 or quoted prices on similar assets level 2 are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in the absence of quoted prices or liquid markets valuation techniques would be used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable level 3 valuation techniques are based on various assumptions including timing and amounts of cash flows discount rates rate of return and adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity a significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using level 3 inputs the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition as of december 31 2016 none of our investments were categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our security valuation methodologies 

we periodically evaluate if unrealized losses as determined based on the security valuation methodologies discussed above on individual securities classified as availableforsale or heldtomaturity are considered to be otherthantemporary the analysis of otherthantemporary impairment requires the use of various assumptions including the length of time an investment’s cost basis is greater than fair value the severity of the investment’s decline any credit deterioration of the investment whether management intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded to income and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

business combinations  accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions we account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed including any contingent consideration and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation of the purchase price utilizes significant estimates in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets the significant estimates and assumptions include the timing and amount of future revenues and cash flows anticipated growth rates customer attrition rates the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and the determination of useful lives for finitelived assets 

longlived assets and finitelived intangibles  we review longlived assets and certain finitelived identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable we recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such assets the impairment loss is determined as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset assessing the fair value of assets involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination our reporting units are one level below our operating segments goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate regulatory environment established business plans operating performance indicators or competition evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach using market multiples under the income approach we need to estimate projected future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and long term growth rates and determine the appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows the discount rate used is based on our weightedaverage cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected future cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenues and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit there was no indication of goodwill impairment as a result of our 2016 annual impairment analysis as the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their respective net book values including goodwill further a 10 increase or decrease in any of the key assumptions used under either the income approach or the market approach would not result in a significant impact to the excess fair value over book value for any of our reporting units 

the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant our 2016  qualitative assessment included the review of relevant macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets was below carrying value 

based on our most recent evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which was performed as of december 31 2016  none of our reporting units or indefinitelived intangible assets was considered to be at risk of impairment as of december 31 2016  our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances were 2554 million  and 63 million respectively 

contingencies  loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated when a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable we do not record a liability but instead disclose the nature and the amount of the claim and an estimate of the loss or range of loss if such an estimate can be made significant judgment is required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective and based on the information available from the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel as additional information becomes available we reassess any potential liability related to any pending litigation and may revise our estimates such revisions in estimates of any potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

 you are advised to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in the reports we file with the securities and exchange commission including this report in the sections titled “part i item 1 business” “part i item 1a risk factors” and “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as may be required under applicable securities laws 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee additionally the brexit referendum and its effect on the british pound may subject us to increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rate movements accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses these us dollar  indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs as of december 31 2016  the notional value and weighted average contract rates of these contracts were as follows 



as of december 31 2016  the net unrealized gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was 51 million  based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2016  which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 229 million  

our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk for transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary these contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2017  that are used to hedge our foreign currency denominated net monetary assets at december 31 2016  the notional value of the outstanding contracts was 213 million  and the related fair value was a liability of 4 million  based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2016  which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 20 million  

in 2014 we entered into a credit agreement providing for a 1000 million unsecured term loan and a 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility the term loan and the revolving credit facility both mature on november 20 2019 as of december 31 2016  we have no  outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility the credit agreement requires interest to be paid at either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate plus a margin the margin over the base rate is 000 and the margin over the eurocurrency rate ranges from 075 to 1125 depending on our debt ratings or if we have not received debt ratings from 0875 to 100 depending on our debt to total stockholders equity ratio thus our debt exposes us to market risk from changes in interest rates we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our interest expense a 100 change in interest rates with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a 34 change to our reported interest expense for 2016 

we typically invest in highly rated securities and our policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss we may sell our investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes in anticipation of credit deterioration or for duration management as of december 31 2016  our shortterm investments totaled 3135  million our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of time deposits mutual funds invested in fixed income securities indian rupee denominated certificates of deposit and commercial paper us dollar denominated corporate bonds municipal bonds certificates of deposit commercial paper debt issuances by the us government us government agencies foreign governments and supranational entities and assetbacked securities the assetbacked securities included government national mortgage association gnma mortgage backed securities and securities backed by auto loans credit card receivables and other receivables 

in addition our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are subject to market risk from changes in interest rates as of december 31 2016  a 10 change in interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a change in the fair market value of our availableforsale investment securities of approximately 3 million

 item 9a controls and procedures 

background and internal investigation 

as previously disclosed the company is conducting an internal investigation focused on whether certain payments relating to companyowned facilities in india were made improperly and in possible violation of the fcpa and other applicable laws during the third quarter of 2016 through the internal investigation we discovered that certain members of senior management may have participated in or been aware of the making of potentially improper payments and failed to take action to prevent the making of potentially improper payments by either overriding or failing to enforce the controls established by the company relating to real estate and procurement principally in connection with permits for certain facilities in india such actions would be inconsistent with the standards and tone at the top to which our board of directors and senior management are committed and would be in violation of the company’s written code of conduct and procedures established in part to detect and prevent improper payments based on the results of the investigation to date the members of senior management who may have participated in or been aware of the making of the identified potentially improper payments and failed to take action to prevent the making of the identified potentially improper payments are no longer with the company or in a senior management position 

as a result of the foregoing as disclosed in our form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2016 we determined that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of december 31 2015 and continued to exist in subsequent interim periods accordingly we updated the previous conclusion included in item 9a of our form 10k filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 25 2016 that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were effective to conclude that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 were ineffective we also updated the previous conclusions included in item 4 of our forms 10q filed with the securities and exchange commission on may 6 2016 and august 5 2016 that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to conclude that our disclosure controls and procedures as of march 31 2016 and june 30 2016 respectively were ineffective 

our management has concluded that we continued to have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 however based on the results of the investigation to date no material adjustments restatement or other revisions to our previously issued financial statements are required 

management’s responsibility for the financial statements 

our management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of all information presented in this annual report the consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management’s best estimates and judgments management believes the consolidated financial statements fairly reflect the form and substance of transactions and that the financial statements fairly represent the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the audit committee of the board of directors which is composed solely of independent directors meets regularly with the company’s independent registered public accounting firm and representatives of management to review accounting financial reporting internal control and audit matters as well as the nature and extent of the audit effort the audit committee is responsible for the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm the independent registered public accounting firm has free access to the audit committee 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act as of december 31 2016  

we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described further below based on the evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and as a result of the material weakness described below our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 31 2016 the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act and is a process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive and chief financial officers and effected by our board of directors 

management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 our management under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016  in making this assessment the company’s management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework 2013  

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

based on the results of the internal investigation to date we concluded that as of december 31 2016 we did not maintain an effective control environment specifically we did not maintain an effective tone at the top as certain persons who were members of senior management for part of the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 may have participated in or been aware of the making of the potentially improper payments and failed to take action to prevent the making of potentially improper payments by either overriding or failing to enforce the controls established by the company relating to real estate and procurement principally in connection with permits for certain facilities in india 

this control deficiency did not result in a material misstatement of our current or prior period consolidated annual or interim financial statements however this control deficiency could have resulted in material misstatements to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not have been prevented or detected accordingly management has concluded that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness 

based on its evaluation our management has concluded that as of december 31 2016 as the result of the material weakness described above our internal control over financial reporting was not effective the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears herein 

remediation plans 

we have begun and expect to continue implementing various changes in our internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weakness described above 

while the internal investigation is ongoing based on the results of the investigation to date the members of senior management who may have participated in or been aware of the making of the identified potentially improper payments and failed to take action to prevent the making of the identified potentially improper payments were no longer with the company or in a senior management position as of december 31 2016 additional personnel actions have been taken with respect to other employees and further actions may be required 

we have recently initiated additional measures to address the above deficiencies which we believe will contribute to the ultimate remediation of the material weakness these additional measures include enhanced oversight controls in the areas of procurement and accounts payable as they relate to real estate transactions in india 

changes in internal control over financial reporting

business strategies 

our objectives are to maximize shareholder value and enhance our position as a leading provider of information technology consulting and business process services we implement the following core strategies to achieve these objectives 

growth through reinvestment  we aim to invest our profits above the 19 to 20 nongaap operating margin level excluding stockbased compensation expense and acquisitionrelated charges back into our business we believe this is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth this investment is primarily focused in the areas of strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise training our technical staff in a broader range of service offerings recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees and maintaining a level of resources trained in a broad range of service offerings to be well positioned to respond to our client requests as described below 

 

global delivery model  we have a fourtiered global architecture for service delivery and operations consisting of employees colocated at clients’ sites at local facilities or incountry delivery centers at regional delivery centers and at global delivery centers our extensive facilities technology and communications infrastructure facilitate the seamless integration of our global workforces this is accomplished by permitting team members in different locations to access common project information and to work directly on client projects this infrastructure allows for rapid completion of projects highest level of quality efficient use of clients’ technological resources and realtime access to project information by the onsite account manager or the client in addition for large projects with short time frames our offshore facilities allow for parallel processing of various development phases to accelerate delivery time key aspects of our global delivery model include 

 further development of longterm client relationships  we have strong longterm strategic relationships with our clients and business partners we seek to establish longterm relationships that present recurring revenue opportunities frequently trying to establish relationships with our clients’ chief information officers or other it and business decision makers by offering a wide array of costeffective high quality services approximately 984 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2015 were derived from clients who had been using our services at the end of 2014 we also seek to leverage our experience with a client’s it systems into new business opportunities a successful track record and indepth knowledge of a client’s processes and it systems gained during the performance of application maintenance services can provide us with a competitive advantage in securing additional maintenance development and other projects 

pursuit of selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances  we believe that opportunities continue to exist in the fragmented market in which we operate to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances we believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence service offering and capabilities more rapidly 

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our services directly through our professional staff senior management and direct sales personnel operating out of our global headquarters and business development offices which are strategically located in various metropolitan areas around the world the sales and marketing group works with our client delivery team as the sales process moves closer to the customer’s selection of a services provider the duration of the sales process may vary widely depending on the type and complexity of services 

customers 

the number of customers served by us has increased significantly in recent years as of december 31 2015  we increased the number of strategic clients to 300  we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate at least 5 million to 50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity accordingly we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment however no individual customer exceeded 100 of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services generally would require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  786  768 and 776 of our revenue respectively was from north american customers the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a significant customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year presented in the table below is additional information about our customers

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

we face various important risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition and as a result cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock  

risks relating to our business 

we face intense competition from other service providers 

we operate in intensely competitive industries that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards and changes in customer requirements the intensely competitive information technology consulting and business process services markets include a large number of participants and are subject to rapid change these markets include participants from a variety of market segments including 

 these markets also include numerous smaller local competitors in the various geographic markets in which we operate which may be able to provide services and solutions at lower costs or on terms more attractive to clients than we can our direct competitors include among others accenture capgemini computer sciences corporation genpact hcl technologies hp enterprise ibm global services infosys technologies tata consultancy services and wipro in certain markets our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals there is a risk that increased competition could put downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services and in turn our operating margins similarly if our competitors develop and implement processes and methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices without adversely affecting their profit margins if we are unable to provide our clients with superior services and solutions at competitive prices or successfully market those services to current and prospective clients our business results of operations and financial condition may suffer 

our international expansion plans may not be successful if we are unable to compete effectively in other countries we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations additionally such companies may have longstanding or wellestablished relationships with desired clients which may put us at a competitive disadvantage if we fail to compete effectively in the new markets we enter our ability to continue to grow our business could be adversely affected in addition if we cannot compete effectively we may be required to reconsider our strategy to expand internationally as well as our intent not to repatriate our nonus earnings 

we may also face competition from companies that increase in size or scope as the result of strategic mergers or acquisitions these transactions may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers software companies and vendors and service providers which could result in the convergence of products and services if buyers of products and services in the markets we serve favor using a single provider of integrated products and services such buyers may direct more business to such providers which could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and in turn adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating margin may decline and we may not be able to sustain our current level of profitability 

our operating margin may decline if we experience declines in demand and pricing for our services an increase in our operating costs including imposition of new nonincome related taxes or adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition wages in india have historically increased at a faster rate than in the united states which has in the past and may in the future put pressure on our operating margins due to our offshore delivery model additionally the number and type of equitybased compensation awards and the assumptions used in valuing equitybased compensation awards may change resulting in increased stockbased compensation expense and lower margins 

further our operating margin and therefore our profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to recover for our services if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our operating margin and our profitability could suffer the rates we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 in addition if we are not able to maintain an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals our profitability may suffer our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 if we are unable to control our costs and operate our business in an efficient manner our operating margin and therefore our profitability may decline 

we could be held liable for damages or our reputation could suffer from security breaches or disclosure of confidential information or personal data 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and securely store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or data including personal data in addition many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses the theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our or our clients’ confidential information or other proprietary business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce marketplace acceptance of our services any failure in the networks or computer systems used by us or our customers could result in a claim for substantial damages against us and significant reputational harm regardless of our responsibility for the failure 

in addition we often have access to or are required to manage utilize collect and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data including personal data as a result we are subject to numerous us and nonus laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of personal data if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches controls or procedures with which we are responsible for complying with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data or if unauthorized access to or disclosure of data in our possession or control occurs we could be subject to liability and penalties in connection with any violation of applicable privacy laws andor criminal prosecution as well as significant liability to our clients or our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or privacy laws these risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloudbased offerings and services and store and process increasingly large amounts of our customers’ confidential information and data and host or manage parts of our customers’ businesses especially in industries involving particularly sensitive data such as the financial services industry and the healthcare industry unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data including personal data whether through breach of computer systems systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation or otherwise could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems and networks or those we develop or manage for our clients whether by our employees or third parties could result in negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 healthcarerelated data protection privacy and similar laws restrict access use and disclosure of information and failure to comply with or adapt to changes in these laws could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as a service provider in the healthcare industry we are subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act or hitech which are federal laws that apply to firms that provide services to certain entities in the healthcare industry 

a portion of the data that we obtain and handle for or on behalf of our healthcare clients is subject to hipaa and we are required to maintain the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information in accordance with hipaa and the terms of our agreements with clients hitech increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against us and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal court to enforce hipaa’s requirements we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs to establish and maintain hipaarequired safeguards and if additional safeguards are required to comply with hipaa or our healthcare clients requirements our costs could increase further which would negatively affect our results of operations furthermore if we fail to maintain adequate safeguards or we inappropriately use or disclose individually identifiable health information we could be subject to significant liabilities and consequences including without limitation 

 laws and expectations relating to privacy security and data protection continue to evolve and we continue to adapt to changing needs nevertheless changes in these laws may limit our data access use and disclosure and may require increased expenditures by us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide services to our healthcare clients and in turn on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our revenues and operating results may experience significant quarterly fluctuations 

we may experience significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations among the factors that could cause these variations are 

 18 

as a result of these factors it is possible that in some future periods our revenues and results of operations may be significantly below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such an event the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on a few customers for a large portion of our revenues 

our top five and top ten customers generated approximately 110  and 186  respectively of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a major customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year the loss of one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business results of operations and financial condition will suffer if we fail to enhance our existing services and solutions and develop new services and solutions that allow us to keep pace with rapidly evolving technological developments 

the information technology consulting and business process services markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions our future success will depend on our ability to develop services and solutions that keep pace with changes in the markets in which we operate we cannot be sure that we will be successful in developing new services and solutions addressing evolving technologies in a timely or costeffective manner or that any services and solutions we do develop will be successful in the marketplace our failure to address the demands of the rapidly evolving technological environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain and attract clients and our competitive position which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business results of operations and financial condition may be affected by the rate of growth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of technology spending by our clients 

our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients as well as their customers and suppliers in challenging economic environments our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities or may choose to use their own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm to perform the types of services and solutions we provide in addition many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel processes and infrastructures if the growth of technology usage in business or our clients’ spending on technology in business declines or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new technological solutions our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

most of our contracts with our customers are shortterm and our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if our clients terminate their contracts on short notice 

consistent with industry practice most of our contracts with our customers are shortterm a majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice and without significant early termination cost terminations may result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project including the business or financial condition of a client changes in ownership management or the strategy of a client or economic or market conditions generally or specific to a client’s industry when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to eliminate our associated costs in a timely manner consequently our operating margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected if we are unable to replace the lost revenue with other work on terms we find acceptable or effectively eliminate costs our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions we predominantly contract to provide services either on a timeandmaterials basis or on a fixedprice basis fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 365  of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  and we expect that an increasing number of our future projects will be contracted on a fixedprice basis our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations and utilizing workforces with different skill sets and competencies across geographically diverse service locations our pricing cost and operating margin estimates for the work that we perform frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life 

of the contract there is a risk that we will underprice our projects fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future we may not be able to report our financial results accurately which may adversely affect our stock price and our business 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations require our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we have committed and will be required to continue to commit significant financial and managerial resources in order to comply with these requirements 

further we are required to integrate any acquired businesses into our system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting companies we acquire may not be required to implement or maintain the disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are required of public companies prior to being acquired by us and we cannot provide assurance as to how long the integration process may take 

internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls we may not have adequate accurate or timely financial information and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company or comply with the requirements of the sec or the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 this could result in a restatement of our financial statements the imposition of sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information any such consequence or other negative effect of our inability to meet our reporting requirements or comply with legal and regulatory requirements as well as any disclosure of an accounting reporting or control issue could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our business 

we may not be able to successfully acquire target companies or integrate acquired companies or technologies into our company and we may become subject to certain liabilities assumed or incurred in connection with our acquisitions that could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses including trizetto into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services the process of integrating an acquired company business or technology has created and will continue to create operating difficulties the risks we face include 

 although we conduct due diligence in connection with each of our acquisitions there may be liabilities that we fail to discover that we inadequately assess or that are not properly disclosed to us in particular to the extent that any acquired business or any assets thereof i failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations ii failed to fulfill contractual obligations to customers or iii incurred material liabilities or obligations to customers that are not identified during the diligence process we as the successor owner may be financially responsible for these violations failures and liabilities and may suffer financial andor reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected in addition as part of an acquisition we may assume responsibilities and obligations of the acquired business pursuant to the terms and conditions of agreements entered by the acquired entity that are not consistent with the terms and conditions that we typically accept and require we also have been and may in the future be subject to litigation or other claims in connection with an acquired company including claims from terminated employees customers former stockholders or other third parties any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

we cannot predict or guarantee that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates consummate any acquisition or integrate any acquired business any failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

system failures system outages or operational disruptions in our communications or information technology systems and infrastructure could negatively impact our operations and ability to provide our services and solutions which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

to deliver our services and solutions to our customers we must maintain a high speed network of satellite fiber optic and land lines and active voice and data communications 24 hours a day between our main operating offices in india our other development and delivery centers and the offices of our customers worldwide any systems failure or outage or a significant disruption in our ability to transmit voice and data through satellite and telephone communications or in our information technology systems and infrastructure could result in curtailed operations and a loss of customers which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business results of operations and financial condition could be impaired if we lose key members of our management team 

our future performance depends upon the continued service of the key members of our management team competition for experienced executive officers and other key employees in the industries in which we compete is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain key persons or that we will be successful in attracting and retaining replacements in the future the loss of any one or more of our executive officers or significant employees or the failure to attract integrate and retain additional talent could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or significant employees 

in addition our business could be harmed if any key member of our management team leaves our employment and joins one of our competitors currently we have entered into noncompetition agreements with the majority of our executive officers we cannot be certain however that the restrictions in these agreements prohibiting such executive officers from engaging in competitive activities are enforceable any defection by a key member of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

competition for highlyskilled technical personnel is intense and our ability to compete for and manage client engagements depends on our ability to attract and retain such personnel 

our ability to maintain and renew existing client engagements and obtain new business depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highlyskilled technical personnel so as to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in particular in order to serve client needs and grow our business we must attract train and retain appropriate numbers of talented people including project managers it engineers and other senior technical personnel who are able to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences we cannot guarantee that we will be able to train and assimilate new employees successfully in addition we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for professionals with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer we have subcontracted in the past and may continue to subcontract in the future with other service providers in order to meet our obligations to our customers if we are unable to attract and retain highlyskilled technical personnel our ability to effectively lead our current projects and develop new business could be jeopardized and our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our services and solutions 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our clients we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important financial opportunity by doing so or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines in addition the contracting practices of our competitors may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become standard in the marketplace if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide services and solutions and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the enforceable terms of our agreements we might face significant legal liability and our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients or other parties with whom we conduct business with respect to certain matters these arrangements can include provisions whereby we agree to hold the indemnified party and certain of their affiliated entities harmless with respect to thirdparty claims including matters such as our breach of certain representations or covenants our infringement of the intellectual property of others or our gross negligence or willful misconduct payments by us under any of these arrangements are generally conditioned on the client making a claim and providing us with full control over the defense and settlement of such claim it is not possible to determine our maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each 

particular agreement if events arise requiring us to make payment for indemnification claims under our contractual indemnification obligations such payments could have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally our clients may perform audits or require us to perform audits and provide audit reports with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such clients especially when we process data belonging to them our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit in a timely manner we could also incur liability if our controls and procedures or the controls and procedures we manage for a client were to result in an internal control failure or impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements 

we may face difficulties in providing endtoend business solutions or delivering complex and large projects for our clients that could cause clients to discontinue their work with us which in turn could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have been expanding the nature and scope of our engagements and have added new service offerings such as consulting business process services systems integration and outsourcing of entire portions of it infrastructure across the industries we serve the success of these service offerings depends in part upon continued demand for such services by our existing and prospective clients and our ability to meet this demand in a costcompetitive and effective manner to obtain engagements for such endtoend solutions we also are more likely to compete with large wellestablished international consulting firms resulting in increased competition and pricing pressure accordingly we cannot be certain that our new service offerings will effectively meet client needs or that we will be able to attract existing and prospective clients to these service offerings 

the increased breadth of our service offerings has resulted and may continue to result in larger and more complex projects with our clients this requires us to establish closer relationships with our clients and achieve a thorough understanding of their operations our ability to establish such relationships depends on a number of factors including the proficiency of our professionals and our management personnel our failure to understand our client requirements or our failure to deliver services that meet the requirements specified by our clients could result in termination of client contracts and we could be liable to our clients for significant penalties or damages which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

larger projects often involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements these terminations cancellations or delays may result from factors that have little or nothing to do with the quality of our services such as the business or financial condition of our clients or the economy generally such cancellations or delays make it difficult to plan for project resource requirements and inaccuracies in such resource planning and allocation may have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our clients our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients including limited access to the credit markets insolvency or bankruptcy and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

if our clients are not satisfied with our services and solutions or if our reputation in the marketplace is damaged our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing clients our business model also depends on our account teams’ ability to develop relationships with our clients that enable us to understand 

our clients’ needs and deliver services and solutions that are tailored to those needs if a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client in particular clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors 

in addition negative publicity related to our client services or relationships regardless of its accuracy could adversely affect our business by inhibiting our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage due to actions or statements made by current or former clients that are dissatisfied with our services or work product as well as competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators former and current employees members of the investment community and the media damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements and in turn result in a loss of business adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts reduce the value and effectiveness of the cognizant brand name and reduce investor confidence in us any one of which could adversely affecting our business results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on third parties for certain software products 

certain of our software products contain components that are developed by third parties in addition we resell certain software products of third parties and we use thirdparty software products to deliver our services and solutions we may not be able to replace the functions provided by these thirdparty software components or products if they become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or with our services and solutions or if they are not adequately maintained or updated any defects in or significant interruption in the availability of these thirdparty software products or components could harm the sale of our products and our delivery of services and solutions to our clients unless and until we can secure or develop an alternative source in addition thirdparty suppliers of software or other intellectual property assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired as a result of any such denial our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

alternate sources for the technology currently licensed to us may not be available to us in a timely manner may not provide us with the same functions as currently provided to us or may be more expensive than products we currently use further our success depends on our ability to maintain our existing relationships with thirdparty software providers and build new relationships with other providers in order to enhance our services and remain competitive if we are unable to maintain such existing relationships or successfully build new relationships our business results of operations and financial condition could suffer   

we are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio 

any deterioration of the credit and capital markets in the united states europe or other regions of the world could result in volatility of our investment earnings and impairments to our investment portfolio which could negatively impact our financial condition and reported income any decline in economic activity could adversely affect the ability of counterparties to use certain financial instruments such as marketable securities and derivatives to meet their obligations to us 

our revenues are highly dependent on clients concentrated in certain industries including the financial services and healthcare industries consolidation and factors that negatively affect these industries may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

during the year ended december 31 2015  we earned approximately 403  of our revenues from the financial services industry which includes insurance and 295  from the healthcare industry significant consolidation or a decrease in growth in the financial services industry or the healthcare industry may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example two or more of our current clients may merge or consolidate and combine their operations which may cause us to lose work or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies may also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing regulatory economic and political conditions affecting the industries in which we operate we may be unable to effectively plan for or respond to those changes and our business results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected 

our revenues are highly dependent on clients located in the united states and europe any weakening of economic conditions in these markets may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

approximately 786  of our revenues during the year ended december 31 2015  were derived from clients located in north america in the same period approximately 162  of our revenues were derived from clients located in europe any weakening of economic conditions in the united states or european economies could depress the pricing for our services and cause our customers to reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we do not continue to improve our operational financial and other internal controls and systems to manage our rapid growth and size our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our recent and anticipated growth including our acquisition of trizetto will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls in particular our growth will increase the challenges involved in 

 in addition the increasing size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that a member of our personnel will engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity breach our contractual obligations or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train our people and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

there can be no assurance that our business results of operations and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of indebtedness 

on november 20 2014 in conjunction with our acquisition of trizetto we entered into a credit agreement with a bank syndicate providing for a 10 billion unsecured term loan and a 7500 million unsecured revolving credit facility both of which mature on november 20 2019 we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which may be significant we will be required to have sufficient cash available in the united states to pay scheduled installments of principal accrued interest and fees from time to time and at maturity if we do not have sufficient cash available in the united states we may be required to repatriate earnings held by our foreign subsidiaries any such repatriation would cause us to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings at that time which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we may not have sufficient cash in the united states or abroad to make payments on our debt obligations which could cause us to seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our existing indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

in addition the credit agreement contains certain covenants including a requirement that we maintain a debt to total stockholders equity ratio not in excess of 040 to 100 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter failure to comply with this covenant or other provisions of the credit agreement could result in a default under the credit agreement requiring us to either cure such default receive a waiver or in the absence of such cure or waiver refinance any outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement there is no assurance that we would be able to refinance our debt on acceptable terms and conditions 

risks relating to our international operations 

our global operations are subject to complex risks some of which might be beyond our control 

we have offices and operations in various countries around the world and provide services to clients globally in 2015  approximately 786  of our revenues were attributable to the north american region 162  were attributable to the european region and the remainder was attributable to the rest of the world primarily the asia pacific region we anticipate that revenues from customers outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the 

foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence particularly in europe the asia pacific region and the latin america region 

in addition the majority of our employees along with our development and delivery centers are located in india as a result we may be subject to risks inherently associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations difficulties in enforcing intellectual property andor contractual rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable international hostilities terrorism and natural disasters we may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india and we are subject to regulatory economic political and other uncertainties in india 

we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india where a majority of our technical professionals are located while wage costs are lower in india than in the united states and other developed countries for comparably skilled professionals wages in india have historically increased at a faster rate than in the united states and other countries in which we operate if this trend continues in the future it would result in increased costs for our skilled professionals and thereby potentially reduce our operating margins also there is no assurance that in future periods competition for skilled professionals will not drive salaries higher in india thereby resulting in increased costs for our technical professionals and reduced operating margins 

india has also recently experienced civil unrest and terrorism and has been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries in recent years there have been military confrontations between india and pakistan that have occurred in the region of kashmir and along the indiapakistan border the potential for hostilities between the two countries has been high in light of tensions related to recent terrorist incidents in india and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment including events in and related to afghanistan iraq and syria if india becomes engaged in armed hostilities particularly if these hostilities are protracted or involve the threat of or use of weapons of mass destruction it is likely that our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 

in the past the indian economy has experienced many of the problems that commonly confront the economies of developing countries including high inflation erratic gross domestic product growth and shortages of foreign exchange the indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy and indian government actions concerning the economy could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities like us in the past the indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy including the software development services industry changes in government leadership in india or a change in policies of the existing government in india that results in the elimination of any of the benefits realized by us from our indian operations or the imposition of new taxes applicable to such operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the indian rupee and other foreign currency exchange rates restrictions on the deployment of cash across our global operations and our use of derivative financial instruments 

although we report our operating results in us dollars a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues income from operations net income and the value of balance sheet items originally denominated in other currencies there is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations in addition in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which could limit our ability to use these funds across our global operations further as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee against the us dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain rupee denominated payments in india these contracts are intended to partially offset the impact of the movement of the exchange rates on future operating costs in addition we have also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to 

mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign currency denominated net monetary assets the hedging strategies that we have implemented or may in the future implement to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market operational and counterparty credit risks accordingly we may incur losses from our use of derivative financial instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violations of these regulations could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

because we provide services to clients throughout the world we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal rules on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations violations of these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business damage to our reputation and other unintended consequences such as liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

among other anticorruption laws and regulations we are subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which prohibits improper payments or offers of improper payments to foreign officials to obtain business or any other benefit and the uk bribery act violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions including fines and suspension or disqualification from government contracting or contracting with private entities in certain highly regulated industries any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

international hostilities terrorist activities other violence or war natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could delay or reduce the number of new service orders we receive and impair our ability to service our customers thereby adversely affecting our business results of operations and financial condition 

hostilities involving acts of terrorism violence or war natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat or perceived potential for these events could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to provide services to our customers such events may cause customers to delay their decisions on spending for information technology consulting and business process services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our personnel and to our and our clients’ physical facilities and operations around the world additionally by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to some or all of our clients the majority of our employees are located in india and the vast majority of our technical professionals in the united states and europe are indian nationals who are able to work in the united states and europe only because they hold current visas and work permits any inability to travel could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs and expenses or could impair our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

hostilities involving the united states the united kingdom india and other countries in which we provide services to our clients and other acts of terrorism violence or war natural disasters global health risks or pandemics may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues if we fail to defend against any of these occurrences we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks relating to taxes 

our earnings and financial condition may be negatively impacted by certain tax related matters 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods in addition our income tax returns are subject to examination in the jurisdictions in which we operate we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for 

income taxes an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these examinations may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate foreign earnings or if such earnings become subject to us tax on a current basis 

we earn a significant amount of our earnings outside of the united states other than amounts for which we have already accrued us taxes we consider foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur that could effectively force us to change our intent not to repatriate such earnings if such earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states or if legislation is enacted in the united states providing for a tax on foreign earnings or profits prior to their repatriation we may have to accrue taxes associated with such earnings or profits at a substantially higher rate which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our earnings may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided by india to companies in our industry as well as by possible changes in indian tax laws 

our indian subsidiaries collectively referred to as cognizant india are primarily exportoriented and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the indian government for export activities conducted within special economic zones or sezs for periods of up to 15 years recently the indian government announced a proposal which includes among other items phasing out of certain tax exemptions and deductions discontinuation of tax holiday for new sezs commencing activity from april 1 2017 and a phased reduction of the current indian corporate income tax rate if enacted these changes or any changes that would reduce or deny sez tax benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition all indian profits including those generated within sezs are subject to the minimum alternative tax or mat at the rate of 213 any mat paid is creditable against future corporate income tax subject to limitations currently we anticipate utilizing our existing mat balances against future corporate income tax our ability to fully do so may be influenced by possible changes to the indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of cognizant india our potential inability to fully utilize our deferred income tax assets related to the mat could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating to intellectual property 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other valuable intellectual property we presently hold a limited number of issued patents and we have filed and intend to file patent applications there is no guarantee that any patents will issue in the united states or in any other country we may seek protection or that they will serve as a barrier from competition from other organizations additionally the protection afforded by international patent laws as well as the enforcement actions differ from country to country there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain adequate protection or enforcement of our intellectual property rights 

we also rely upon a combination of copyright and trade secret laws nondisclosure and related contractual arrangements and other security measures to protect our intellectual property rights we believe that laws rules regulations and treaties in effect in the united states india and other countries in which we operate are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property however there can be no assurance that these laws will not change in ways that may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components libraries toolsets and other technology or data we use in the performance of our services and existing laws of some countries in which we provide services such as china might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights there also can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property 

unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in development of technology products or services that compete with our products and services and unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products services or proprietary information if we are unable to protect our intellectual property our business may be adversely affected and our ability to compete may be impaired 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed or used in connection with a contract than we normally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create and intend to reuse across multiple client engagements which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose 

revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

our ability to enforce our software license agreements service agreements and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries to the extent that we seek to enforce our rights we could be subject to claims that an intellectual property right is invalid otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are pursuing a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights may result in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights or assert other claims against us which could harm our business if we are not successful in defending such claims in litigation we may not be able to sell or license a particular service or solution due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations in addition governments may adopt regulations or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others or governments may require that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others third parties may assert against us or our customers claims alleging infringement of patent copyright trademark or other intellectual property rights to technologies or services that are important to our business infringement claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions in our contracts we generally agree to indemnify our clients for certain expenses or liabilities resulting from potential infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of our liability under these indemnities could be substantial any claims that our products services or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims may result in significant costs in defending and resolving such claims and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business in addition as a result of such intellectual property infringement claims we could be required or otherwise decide that it is appropriate to 

 the occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets which would reduce the value of our assets and increase expenses in addition if we alter or discontinue our offering of affected items or services our revenue could be affected if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages 

we expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our competitors are able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights for software products and methods technological solutions and processes we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals or companies that have acquired patent portfolios for the primary purpose of asserting such claims against other companies the risk of infringement claims against us may also increase as we continue to develop and license our intellectual property to our clients and other third parties any infringement claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating to legislation and government regulation 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted and negative perceptions associated with offshore outsourcing could impair our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in the united states which is our largest market as well as in europe the asia pacific and other regions in which we have clients for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by united states companies are periodically considered in the us congress and in numerous state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs domestically if enacted such measures may broaden existing restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource 

services directly or indirectly or impact private industry with measures that include but are not limited to tax disincentives fees or penalties intellectual property transfer restrictions mandatory government audit requirements and new standards that have the effect of restricting the use of certain business andor work visas in the event that any of these measures become law our ability to provide services to our customers could be impaired which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition existing and future legislative and administrativeregulatory policies restricting the performance of business process services from an offshore location in jurisdictions in europe the asia pacific or any other region in which we have clients could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as domestic job loss and theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data particularly involving service providers in india current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from utilizing global service delivery providers due to negative perceptions that may be associated with using global service delivery models or firms any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward global service delivery would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide the majority of their services from within the country in which our clients operate 

restrictions on immigration may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients which could hamper our growth and cause our revenue to decline 

our future success continues to depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills including those from developing countries especially india the ability of foreign nationals to work in the united states europe the asia pacific and other regions in which we have clients depends on their and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits for our personnel who need to travel internationally if we are unable to obtain such visas or work permits or if their issuance is delayed or if their length is shortened we may not be able to provide services to our clients or to continue to provide services on a timely and costeffective basis receive revenues as early as expected or manage our delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the countries in which we have clients are subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement for example the united states congress has recently considered and may consider in the future extensive changes to us immigration laws regarding the admission of highskilled temporary and permanent workers if such provisions are signed into law our cost of doing business in the united states would increase and that may discourage customers from seeking our services our international expansion strategy and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed 

 increased regulation of the financial services industry healthcare industry or other industries in which our clients operate could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

the industries in which our clients are concentrated such as the financial services industry and the healthcare industry are or may be increasingly subject to governmental regulation and intervention for instance the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a provider of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by a number of regulatory agencies these agencies regulate the services we provide and manner in which we operate for example some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required our business may be harmed in addition clients in the financial services sector have been subject to increased regulation following the enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in the united states new or changing regulations under doddfrank as well as other regulations or legislation affecting our customers in the financial services industry may reduce demand for our services or cause us to incur costly changes in our processes or personnel thereby negatively affecting our business results of operations and financial condition 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the federal state and local levels and is subject to changing legislative regulatory political and other influences many healthcare laws such as the affordable care act are complex subject to frequent change and dependent on interpretation and enforcement decisions from government agencies with broad discretion the application of these laws to us our clients or the specific services and relationships we have with our clients is not always clear our failure to anticipate accurately the application of the affordable care act and similar or future laws and regulations 

or our failure to comply with them could create liability for us result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition further the growth of our business results of operations and financial condition rely in part on clients in the healthcare industry that receive substantial revenues from governmental and other thirdparty payor programs a reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs a change in allocation methodologies or the termination of our clients’ government contracts could negatively affect our clients’ businesses and in turn negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition in addition as a service provider to clients who are government contractors we may in the future become involved in governmental investigations to evaluate our or our clients’ compliance with government healthcare programs which could result in the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased regulation changes in existing regulation or increased government intervention in the other industries in which our clients operate also may adversely affect the growth of their respective businesses and therefore negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating to our common stock and governing documents 

our stock price continues to be volatile 

our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline 

provisions in our charter and bylaws and provisions under delaware law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals 

provisions in our charter and bylaws each as amended and delaware general corporate law or dgcl may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover proposals or delaying or preventing changes in our control or management including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices these provisions include 

 these provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock

the following table sets forth key financial results for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  



the key drivers of our revenue growth in 2015  were as follows 

 in december 2015 chennai india experienced heavy rains that caused unprecedented flooding this event did not materially impact our financial results for the three months and year ended december 31 2015 and we do not expect it to materially affect our 2016 financial results 

 

 35 

we saw a continued demand from our customers for a broad range of services including it strategy and business consulting application development and systems integration enterprise information management application testing application maintenance infrastructure services and business process services in addition we are seeing continued customer interest in digital solutions including our social mobile analytics and cloudbased services and increased demand for mobility data and security services we are also seeing an increase in demand for larger more complex projects that are transformational for our customers such contracts may have longer sales cycles and rampup periods and could lead to greater variability in our periodtoperiod operating results we increased the number of strategic clients by 29  during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 300  we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate at least 5 million to 50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity 

in 2015  our operating margin decreased to 173  from 184 in 2014  the decrease in our operating margin was due to increases in compensation and benefit costs inclusive of the impact of higher incentivebased compensation and increases in depreciation and amortization due to recent acquisitions partially offset by the impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar lower realized losses on our cash flow hedges and decreases in certain operating expenses including travel in 2015 compared to 2014 

our nongaap operating margin in 2015  decreased to 197 2  from 202 2  in 2014  the decrease in our nongaap operating margin was due to increases in compensation and benefit costs inclusive of the impact of higher incentivebased compensation partially offset by the impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar lower realized losses on our cash flow hedges and decreases in certain operating expenses including travel in 2015 compared to 2014 historically we have invested our profitability above the 19 to 20 nongaap operating margin level back into our business which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth this investment is primarily focused in the areas of hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise training our technical staff in a broader range of service offerings strengthening our business analytics and digital technology capabilities strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery as well as recognizing and rewarding employee performance by means of enhanced incentivebased compensation in addition this investment includes maintaining a level of resources trained in a broad range of service offerings to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our targeted operating margin levels back into the business 

we finished the year with approximately 221700  employees which is an increase of approximately 10200  over the prior year the increase in the number of our service delivery staff and the related infrastructure costs to meet the demand for our services is the primary driver of the increase in our operating expenses in 2015  annualized turnover including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 191  for the three months ended december 31 2015  the majority of our turnover occurs in india as a result annualized attrition rates onsite at clients are below our global attrition rate in addition attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation costs in india which may continue in the future however historically this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs the mix of our professional staff as well as utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies 

at december 31 2015  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 49495 million  working capital of 51949 million   a nd debt outstanding of 12875  million we believe our cash from operations and capital resources on hand provide sufficient liquidity to continue to make investments to expand and grow our business and meet our debt repayment obligations 

 

 36 

during 2016  barring any unforeseen events we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results 

 in response to this environment we plan to 

 business segments 

our four reportable business segments are 

 our chief operating decision maker evaluates cognizant’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to different degrees expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development and delivery centers certain selling general and administrative expenses excess or shortfall of incentive compensation for delivery personnel as compared to target stockbased compensation expense a portion of depreciation and amortization and the impact of the settlements of our cash flow hedges are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker accordingly such expenses are excluded from segment operating profit 

we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for that segment however no individual customer accounted for sales in excess of 10 of our consolidated revenues during 2015  2014  or 2013  in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and we believe that a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues 

 results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2015   

the following table sets forth certain financial data for the three years ended december 31 2015  

 

 revenue  overall  revenue increased by 210  to 124160 million  during 2015  as compared to an increase of 161 to 102627 million in 2014  in 2015  revenue includes 7245 million from trizetto which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 806 million in 2014 the increase in trizetto revenue represented 299 of the year over year revenue growth in 2015 in both years the remaining increase was primarily attributed to greater acceptance of our global delivery model among an increasing number of industries continued interest in using our global delivery model as a means to reduce overall it and operations costs increased customer spending on discretionary projects and continued penetration in all our geographic markets revenues from new customers contributed 1954 million  and 2981 million representing 91  and 210 of the yearoveryear revenue growth for 2015  and 2014  respectively in 2015  our consulting and technology services revenues increased by 318  and represented 576  of total 2015  revenues while our outsourcing services revenue increased by 89  and constituted 424  of total revenues in 2014  consulting and technology services revenue increased by 221 and represented 528 of total 2014  revenues while our outsourcing services revenue increased by 100 and constituted 472 of total 2014  revenues while both consulting and technology services revenue and outsourcing services revenue grew in 2015  and 2014  we saw a shift in customer spending from legacy application maintenance toward projectbased work including digital and other transformational programs 

revenues from our top five customers as a percentage of total revenues were 110  122 and 132 in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively revenues from our top ten customers as a percentage of total revenues were 186  213 and 226 in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively as we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline over time 

revenue  reportable segments revenues by reportable business segment were as follows 



revenue from our financial services segment grew 167  or 7173 million  in 2015  as compared to 2014  our banking and insurance customers contributed 4036 million  and 3137 million  respectively to the year over year revenue increase in this segment revenue from customers added during 2015  was  573 million  and represented 80  of the year over year revenue increase in this segment key areas of focus for our financial services customers included cost optimization regulatory and compliance driven initiatives cyber security and the adoption and integration of digital technologies to align with shifts in consumer preferences revenue from our financial services segment grew 153  or 5680 million  in 2014  as compared to 2013  in 2014  our banking and insurance customers contributed 3441 million and 2239 million respectively to the year over year revenue growth in 2014  revenue from customers added during that year was 496 million and represented 87 of the year over year revenue increase in this segment we believe future demand from certain of our banking customers may be negatively affected by the current macroeconomic conditions affecting the industry 

revenue from our healthcare segment grew 364  or  9781 million  in 2015  as compared to 2014  during 2015  our healthcare customers contributed 8240 million  to the year over year revenue growth including a 6439 million increase in year over year revenue from trizetto revenue from our life sciences customers increased by 1541 million  revenue from customers added during 2015  was 513 million  and represented 52  of the year over year revenue increase in this segment the demand among our healthcare payer customers was partially driven by cost optimization initiatives revenue from our healthcare segment grew 187  or 4246 million  in 2014  as compared to 2013  and included 806 million from trizetto in 2014  growth over 2013 was driven by an increase in discretionary spending and was negatively affected by uncertainty created by regulatory changes including the affordable care act initiatives in the us in 2014  revenue from customers added during that year including new trizetto customers was 1581 million and represented 372 of the year over year revenue increase in this segment the demand for our services may also be affected by the recent trend towards consolidation within the healthcare payer industry we believe that in the long term the health care industry continues to present a growth opportunity due to factors that are transforming the industry including the changing regulatory environment increasing focus on medical costs and the consumerization of healthcare 

revenue from our manufacturingretaillogistics segment grew 120  or 2503 million  in 2015  as compared to 2014  during 2015  our manufacturing and logistics customers contributed 1303 million  to the year over year revenue growth as compared to 1200 million  for our retail and hospitality customers revenue from customers added during 2015  was 633 million  and represented 253  of the year over year revenue increase in this segment demand within this segment continues to be driven by omnichannel commerce implementation and integration efforts analytics supply chain consulting and implementation initiatives and increased adoption of digital technologies to align with shifts in consumer preferences revenue from our manufacturingretaillogistics segment grew 121  or 2253 million  in 2014  as compared to 2013  in 2014  growth within this segment was stronger among our manufacturing and logistics customers where revenue increased by 1244 million while revenue for our retail and hospitality customers increased by 1008 million in 2014  revenue from customers added during that year was 596 million and represented 265 of the year over year revenue increase in this segment 

revenue from our other segment grew 174  or 2076 million  in 2015  as compared to 2014  in 2015  growth within other was due primarily to increased demand for digital services and was strong among our information media and entertainment customers where revenue increased by 850 million  and our technology customers where revenue increased by 888 million  revenue from customers added during 2015  was 234 million  and represented 113  of the year over year revenue increase in this segment revenue from our other segment grew 203  or 2016 million  in 2014  as compared to 2013  in 2014  growth within other was particularly strong among our telecommunication and high technology customers where revenue increased by 933 million and 710 million respectively due to an increase in discretionary spending in 2014  revenue from customers added during that year was 308 million and represented 153 of the year over year revenue increase in this segment 

revenue  geographic locations  revenues by geographic market as determined by customer location were as follows 



  

north america continues to be our largest market representing 786  of total 2015  revenue and accounting for 18796 million  of the 21533 million  revenue increase in 2015  revenue growth among our north america customers includes 6439 million year over year growth in trizetto revenue 

  

in 2015  revenue from europe grew 66  after a negative currency impact of 102 driven by the increasing acceptance of our global delivery model partially offset by the recent strength of the us dollar against the british pound the euro and other currencies in 2014  revenue from europe grew 193  which included the fullyear benefit of our acquisition of equinox consulting which closed in the fourth quarter of 2013 the 2014  revenue growth in europe was driven by the strength of europes economy and the increasing acceptance of our global delivery model in 2015  revenue from our rest of world customers grew 299  after a negative currency impact of 92 in 2014  revenue from our rest of world customers grew 236 in 2015  and 2014  growth was primarily driven by the india singapore australia japan and hong kong markets we believe that europe the middle east the asia pacific and latin america regions will continue to be areas of significant investment for us as we see these regions as long term growth opportunities 

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense  our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries incentivebased compensation stockbased compensation expense payroll taxes employee benefits immigration and projectrelated travel for technical personnel subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues our cost of revenues increased by 212  or 12991 million  during 2015  as compared to an increase of 166 or 8756 million  during 2014  in both 2015  and 2014  the increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits costs inclusive of the impact of higher incentivebased compensation costs partially offset by the impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar and lower realized losses on our cash flow hedges in 2015  compared to 2014  in 2015  compensation and benefit costs increased by 11121 million  as a result of the increase in the number of our service delivery personnel including new trizetto employees and higher incentivebased compensation costs in 2015  as compared to 2014  in 2014  the increase in compensation and benefit costs was 6506 million as a result of the increase in the number of our service delivery personnel partially offset by lower incentivebased compensation costs in 2014 as compared to 2013 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries incentivebased compensation stockbased compensation expense payroll taxes employee benefits immigration travel marketing communications management finance administrative and occupancy costs selling general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization increased by 267  or 5971 million  during 2015  as compared to an increase of 177 or 3369 million during 2014  selling general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue to 228  in 2015  as compared to 218 in 2014  and 215 in 2013  in 2015  the increase as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefit costs inclusive of the impact of higher incentivebased compensation costs and increases in depreciation and amortization due to recent acquisitions partially offset by the impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar and lower realized losses on our cash flow hedges in 2015  compared to 2014  in 2014  the increase as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to increases in compensation and benefit costs net of the impact of lower incentivebased compensation professional services including acquisitionrelated costs and investments to grow our business partially offset by the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar and lower realized losses on our cash flow hedges in 2014 compared to 2013 

income from operations and operating margin  overall  income from operations increased 136  or 2571 million  in 2015  as compared to an increase of 123 or 2070 million in 2014  our operating margin decreased to 173  of revenues in 

2015  from 184 of revenues in 2014  due to increases in compensation and benefit costs inclusive of the impact of higher incentivebased compensation and increases in depreciation and amortization due to recent acquisitions partially offset by the impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar lower realized losses on our cash flow hedges and decreases in certain operating expenses including travel in 2015  compared to 2014  in 2014  operating margin decreased to 184 of revenues from 190 of revenues in 2013  due to increases in compensation and benefit costs net of the impact of lower incentivebased compensation subcontractor expense professional fees and investments to grow our business partially offset by the impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar and lower realized losses on our cash flow hedges in 2014 compared to 2013 

excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 98  basis points or 098  percentage points in 2015  and 86 basis points or 086 percentage points in 2014  each additional 10 change in exchange rate between the indian rupee and the us dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 19  basis points or 019  percentage points 

we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain indian rupee denominated payments in india these hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the indian rupee during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  the settlement of certain cash flow hedges negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately 57  basis points or 057  percentage points 133 basis points or 133 percentage points and 184 basis points or 184 percentage points respectively 

for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  our nongaap operating margins were 197 3  202 3  and 206 3  respectively as set forth in the “nongaap financial measures” section below our nongaap operating margin excludes stockbased compensation expense and acquisitionrelated charges 

segment operating profit segment operating profits were as follows 



in our financial services healthcare and manufacturingretaillogistics segments segment operating profit increased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to revenue growth outpacing headcount growth and the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits costs and continued investments to grow our business in our other segment segment operating profit decreased as a percentage of revenues due to continued investments to grow our business partially offset by the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar in 2015  the unallocated costs increased when compared to 2014 due to continued investments to grow our business higher incentivebased compensation accrual rates in 2015  compared to 2014  and increases in selling general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization due to recent acquisitions 

the 2014  increase in segment operating profit within our reportable segments was attributable primarily to increased revenues and the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting primarily from additional headcount to support our revenue growth and continued investments to grow our business in 2014 the unallocated costs increased when compared to 2013 due to continued investments to grow our business partially offset by the impact of lower incentivebased compensation accrual rates in 2014

other income expense net  total other income expense net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses interest income and interest expense the following table sets forth for the periods indicated total other income expense net 



the foreign currency exchange losses in all the years presented were attributable to the remeasurement of the indian rupee denominated net monetary assets in our us dollar functional currency india subsidiaries as well as the remeasurement of other net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries the gains losses on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments relate to the realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts entered into primarily to offset foreign currency exposure to the indian rupee and other nonus dollar denominated net monetary assets as of december 31 2015  the notional value of our undesignated hedges was 1655 million  the increases in interest income in 2015  and 2014  were primarily attributed to the increase in average invested balances the 2015  and 2014 increases in interest expense are primarily attributable to the interest on debt originated in the fourth quarter of 2014 

provision for income taxes  the provision for income taxes was 5400 million  in 2015  4847 million in 2014  and 4593 million in 2013  the effective income tax rate decreased to 250  in 2015  from 252 in 2014  primarily due to discrete tax benefits recorded in 2015 partially offset by changes in the geographic mix of our current year taxable income the effective income tax rate decreased to 252 in 2014  from 272 in 2013  primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of taxable income and discrete tax benefits recorded in 2014 partially offset by a scheduled reduction of certain income tax holiday benefits in india in 2014 

net income  net income increased to 16236 million  in 2015  from 14393 million in 2014  and 12286 million in 2013  net income as a percentage of revenues decreased to 131  in 2015  from 140 in 2014  primarily as a result of the decrease in the operating margin partially offset by the decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2014  net income as a percentage of revenues increased slightly to 140 from 139 in 2013  

nongaap financial measures   

portions of our disclosure including the following table include nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share these nongaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies in addition these nongaap measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap the reconciliations of cognizant’s nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures should be carefully evaluated 

we seek to manage the company to a targeted nongaap operating margin of 19 to 20 of revenues we believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the company provides enhanced transparency into the operating results of the company for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes we use nongaap financial information that does not include stockbased compensation expense acquisitionrelated charges and net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses for financial and operational decision making to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors therefore it is our belief that the use of nongaap financial measures excluding these costs provides a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance accordingly we believe that the presentation of nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share when read in conjunction with our reported gaap results can 

provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 

a limitation of using nongaap financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap is that nongaap measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with gaap and exclude costs that are recurring namely stockbased compensation expense certain acquisitionrelated charges and net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses in addition other companies may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than us thereby limiting the usefulness of these nongaap financial measures as a comparative tool we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share to allow investors to evaluate such nongaap financial measures 

the following table presents a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to the most comparable gaap measure for the years ended december 31 



 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash generated from operations has historically been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to grow our business in addition as of december 31 2015  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 49495  million and additional available capacity under our revolving credit facility of approximately 4000 million we have used and plan to continue to use a combination of our cash flow from operations cash on hand and capacity available under our revolving credit facility for expansion of existing operations including our offshore development and delivery centers continued development of new service lines acquisitions of related businesses formation of joint ventures stock repurchases and general corporate purposes including funding working capital requirements 

the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the three years ended december 31 



operating activities the increase in operating cash flow for 2015  compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increase in net income further impacted by the increase in noncash expenses and higher incentivebased compensation accruals that will be paid in the first quarter of 2016 the increase in operating cash flow for 2014 was primarily attributed to the increase in net income trade accounts receivable increased to 22526 million  at december 31 2015  as compared to 19687 million at december 31 2014  and 16488 million at december 31 2013  unbilled accounts receivable increased to 3690 million  at december 31 2015  from 3246 million at december 31 2014  and 2265 million at december 31 2013  the increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable during 2015  was primarily due to increased revenues we monitor turnover aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff our days sales outstanding calculation includes billed and unbilled accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts reduced by the uncollected portion of our deferred revenue our days sales outstanding was 70 days as of december 31 2015  2014 and 2013 

investing activities  the reduction in net cash used in investing activities in 2015  compared to 2014 is due to lower payments for acquisitions as we acquired trizetto in 2014 partially offset by greater net purchases of investments and higher outflows for capital expenditures in 2015 in 2014  the increase in investing outflows when compared to 2013  was primarily related to our payment for the acquisition of trizetto 

financing activities  in 2015  we had net outflows from financing activities primarily due to our net repayments of debt and greater stock repurchases as compared to net cash inflows from financing activities in 2014 driven by our net borrowings under the credit agreement in 2014 the increase in net cash provided by financing activities when compared to 2013  was primarily related to proceeds from borrowings under the 2014 credit agreement 

on november 20 2014 we entered into a credit agreement with a commercial bank syndicate providing for a 10000 million unsecured term loan and a 7500 million revolving credit facility the term loan was used to pay a portion of the cash consideration in connection with our acquisition of trizetto the revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes the term loan and the revolving credit facility both mature on november 20 2019 as of december 31 2015  we had 9375 million outstanding under the term loan and 3500 million  outstanding under the revolving credit facility 

the credit agreement requires interest to be paid at either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate plus a margin the margin over the base rate is 000  and the margin over the eurocurrency rate ranges from 075  to 1125  depending on our debt ratings or if we have not received debt ratings from 0875 to 100  depending on our debt to total stockholders equity ratio thus our debt exposes us to market risk from changes in interest rates under the credit agreement we are required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility which vary based on our debt ratings or if we have not received debt ratings our debt to total stockholders equity ratio additionally we are required to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the term loan 

the credit agreement contains certain negative covenants including limitations on liens mergers consolidations and acquisitions subsidiary indebtedness and affiliate transactions as well as certain affirmative covenants in addition the credit agreement requires us to maintain a debt to total stockholders equity ratio not in excess of 040 to 100 as of december 31 2015  we are in compliance with our debt covenants and have provided a quarterly certification to our lenders to that effect we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the credit agreement to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the remaining available capacity under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2015  and through the date of this filing 

we intend to continue to use a portion of our available capital resources for stock repurchases during 2016 the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our openmarket share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including without limitation our stock price and other market conditions our ongoing capital allocation planning the levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic andor business conditions and 

board and management discretion additionally as these factors may change over the course of the year the amount of stock repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time stock repurchases may be made from time to time through openmarket purchases and through the use of rule 10b51 plans andor by other means the stock repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time without notice 

we believe our us cash flows continue to be sufficient to fund our current domestic operations and obligations including debt service the amount of funds held in us tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business including debt repayments and due to other reasons such as acquisitionrelated activities the company’s us operations historically have generated and are expected to continue to generate substantial cash flows in circumstances where the company has additional cash requirements in the united states we have several additional liquidity options available to meet those requirements these options may include borrowing additional funds including borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility temporarily utilizing intercompany loans with certain foreign subsidiaries on a limited basis and while we currently do not have plans to do so repatriating certain of our foreign earnings we also believe we have access to the credit and equity markets and could borrow additional funds under acceptable terms and conditions or raise additional capital through an equity transaction 

many of our operations are conducted outside the united states and significant portions of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are held internationally as of december 31 2015  45057 million  of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held outside the united states as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows and cash balances we utilize certain strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to income taxes in the united states less applicable foreign tax credits other than amounts for which we have already accrued us taxes we intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these amounts to fund our liquidity needs in the united states if such earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings at that time due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation 

we expect our operating cash flow cash and investment balances and available capacity under our revolving credit facility to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our longterm capital requirements beyond a twelve month period will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock our continued intent not to repatriate foreign earnings and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we cannot be certain that additional financing if required will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all 

commitments and contingencies 

as of december 31 2015  we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments 



  

 45 

 as of december 31 2015  we had 1387 million  of unrecognized tax benefits this represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution the resolution of these income tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india as of december 31 2015  these contracts were in a net unrealized loss position of 144 million  and have settlement dates in 2016 2017 and 2018 the actual amounts at which these contracts will be settled may be significantly impacted by fluctuations in the indian rupee to us dollar foreign currency exchange rate prior to settlement therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period related to the settlement of these foreign exchange forward contracts 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in the opinion of management the outcome of any existing claims and legal or regulatory proceedings if decided adversely is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our clients including any breach involving a customer’s confidential information or sensitive data or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our services there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover all types of claims continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed or are not covered by our insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

foreign currency risk 

overall we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as 786  of our revenues during 2015  were generated from customers located in north america revenue from our customers in the united kingdom rest of europe and rest of world represented 96  66  and 52  respectively of our 2015  revenues accordingly our operating results outside the united states may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates primarily the british pound and the euro as compared to the us dollar 

a portion of our costs in india representing approximately 235  of our global operating costs during 2015  are denominated in the indian rupee and are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations in addition a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may result in nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement in 2015  we reported foreign currency exchange losses exclusive of hedging gains or losses of approximately 429  million which were attributable to the remeasurement of the indian rupee denominated net monetary assets in our us dollar functional currency india subsidiaries as well as the remeasurement of other net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to certain currencies primarily the indian rupee in our foreign subsidiaries 

we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses these hedges to buy indian rupees and sell us dollars are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs in 2015  we reported net losses of 712 million  on contracts that settled during the year as of december 31 2015  we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of 24450 million  and weighted average contract rate of 702  indian rupees to the us dollar these contracts are scheduled to mature as follows 



our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk for transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary these contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2016  which are used to hedge our foreign currency denominated net monetary assets at december 31 2015  the notional value of the outstanding contracts was 1655 million  and the related fair value was a liability of 08 million  during 2015  inclusive of gains of 03 million  on our undesignated balance sheet hedges we reported net foreign currency exchange losses of approximately 426  million 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than our foreign exchange forward contracts there were no offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2015  2014  and 2013  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

effects of inflation 

our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals in certain regions competition for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation as with other service providers in our industry we must adequately anticipate wage increases particularly on our fixedprice contracts historically we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation in india however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future 

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or us gaap we base our estimates on historical experience current trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared we evaluate our estimates on a continuous basis however the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial statements as they require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenues related to our highly complex application development contracts which are predominantly fixedprice contracts and certain other fixedprice contracts are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method and the proportional performance method of accounting respectively under the 

percentage of completion method total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized based on the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost cost to cost method under the proportional performance method total contract revenue is recognized based on the level of effort to date in relation to total expected efforts provided to the customer management reviews the assumptions related to these methods on an ongoing basis revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and such losses are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations changes in estimates related to our revenue contracts and contract losses were immaterial for the periods presented 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating the financial condition and relative creditworthiness of each customer historical collections experience and other information including the aging of the receivables 

income taxes  determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and related valuation allowance if any and liabilities requires significant judgment we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate the consolidated provision for income taxes may also change period to period based on nonrecurring events such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of reserves established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related interest which may require us to apply judgment to complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit to the extent that the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies if it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred income tax asset will not be realized a valuation allowance is provided in the event we change our determination as to the amount of deferred income tax assets that can be realized we will adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact recorded to our provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our indian subsidiaries collectively referred to as cognizant india are primarily exportoriented companies and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the government of india for export activities conducted within sezs for periods of up to 15 years a majority of our sez income tax holiday benefits are currently scheduled to expire in whole or in part during the years 2016 to 2025 and may be extended on a limited basis for an additional five years per unit if certain reinvestment criteria are met we have constructed and expect to continue to operate most of our newer development facilities in sezs our indian profits ineligible for sez benefits are subject to corporate income tax at the rate of 346 in addition all indian profits including those generated within sezs are subject to the mat at the rate of 213 any mat paid is creditable against future indian corporate income tax subject to limitations currently we anticipate utilizing our existing mat balances against our future corporate income tax obligations in india however our ability to do so could be impacted by possible changes to the indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of cognizant india additionally the indian government recently announced a proposal which includes among other items phasing out of certain tax exemptions and deductions discontinuation of tax holidays for new sezs commencing activity from april 1 2017 and a phased reduction of the current indian corporate income tax rate upon enactment we will evaluate the impact of these proposals on our effective income tax rate 

stockbased compensation  stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised the expected volatility of our stock and the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited in addition for performance stock units we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to 

determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period to the extent that actual results differ significantly from our estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

derivative financial instruments  derivative financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that each derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date our derivative financial instruments consist of foreign exchange forward contracts we estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange forward contract by using a present value of expected cash flows model this model utilizes various assumptions including but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows discount rates and credit risk factors the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

investments  our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of time deposits mutual funds invested in fixed income securities and us dollar denominated corporate bonds municipal bonds certificates of deposit commercial paper debt issuances by the us government us government agencies foreign governments and supranational entities and assetbacked securities the assetbacked securities included government national mortgage association gnma mortgage backed securities and securities backed by auto loans credit card receivables and other receivables the years of issuance of our assetbacked securities fall in the 2005 to 2015 range 

we utilize various inputs to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio to the extent they exist unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets level 1 or quoted prices on similar assets level 2 are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in the absence of quoted prices or liquid markets valuation techniques would be used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable level 3 valuation techniques are based on various assumptions including but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows discount rates rate of return and adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity a significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using level 3 inputs the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our security valuation methodologies 

we periodically evaluate if unrealized losses as determined based on the security valuation methodologies discussed above on individual securities classified as availableforsale in the investment portfolio are considered to be otherthantemporary the analysis of otherthantemporary impairment requires the use of various assumptions including but not limited to the length of time an investment’s book value is greater than fair value the severity of the investment’s decline any credit deterioration of the investment whether management intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is generally recorded to income and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

business combinations  accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions we account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation of the purchase price utilizes significant estimates in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets the significant estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to the timing and amount of future revenue and cash flows based on among other things anticipated growth rates and customer attrition rates and the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows as well as the determination of useful lives for finitelived assets 

longlived assets and finitelived intangibles  we review longlived assets and certain finitelived identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable we recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such assets the impairment loss would equal the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset assessing the fair value of assets involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows if such assets were determined to be impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles  we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination reporting units are our operating segments or one level below the operating segments goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate regulatory environment established 

business plans operating performance indicators or competition evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach using market multiples under the income approach we need to estimate projected future cash flows the timing of such cash flows and long term growth rates and determine the appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows the discount rate used is based on our weightedaverage cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected future cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit 

the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant our 2015 qualitative assessment included the review of relevant macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets was below carrying value 

based on our most recent evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which was performed as of december 31 2015 none of our reporting units or indefinitelived intangible assets was considered to be at risk of impairment as of december 31 2015  our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset balances were 24047 million  and 630 million respectively

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses these us dollar  indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs as of december 31 2015  the notional value and weighted average contract rates of these contracts were as follows 



as of december 31 2015  the net unrealized loss on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was 144 million  based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2015  which estimates the 

fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 2277 million  

our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk for transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary these contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2016  which are used to hedge our foreign currency denominated net monetary assets at december 31 2015  the notional value of the outstanding contracts was 1655 million  and the related fair value was a liability of 08 million  based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2015  which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 165 million  

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we entered into a credit agreement providing for a 1000 million  unsecured term loan and a 7500 million  unsecured revolving credit facility the term loan and the revolving credit facility both mature on november 20 2019 as of december 31 2015  we have 3500 million  outstanding under the revolving credit facility the credit agreement requires interest to be paid at either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate plus a margin the margin over the base rate is 000  and the margin over the eurocurrency rate ranges from 075  to 1125  depending on our debt ratings or if we have not received debt ratings from 0875 to 100  depending on our debt to total stockholders equity ratio thus our debt exposes us to market risk from changes in interest rates we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our interest expense a 10 change in interest rates with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an approximately 03 million change to our reported interest expense for 2015 

in addition our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are subject to market risk from changes in interest rates as of december 31 2015  a 10 change in interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a change in the fair market value of our availableforsale investment securities of approximately 25 million 

information provided by the sensitivity analysis does not necessarily represent the actual changes that would occur under normal market conditions 

we typically invest in highlyrated securities and our policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss we may sell our investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes in anticipation of credit deterioration or for duration management as of december 31 2015  our shortterm investments totaled 28243  million our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of time deposits mutual funds invested in fixed income securities and us dollar denominated corporate bonds municipal bonds certificates of deposit commercial paper debt issuances by the us government us government agencies foreign governments and supranational entities and assetbacked securities the assetbacked securities included government national mortgage association gnma mortgage backed securities and securities backed by auto loans credit card receivables and other receivables

 business strategies 

our objectives are to maximize shareholder value and enhance our position as a leading provider of information technology consulting and business process services we implement the following core strategies to achieve these objectives 

growth through reinvestment  we aim to invest our profits above the 19 to 20 nongaap operating margin level excluding stockbased compensation expense and acquisitionrelated charges back into our business we believe this is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth this investment is primarily focused in the areas of strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise training our technical staff in a broader range of service offerings recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees and maintaining a level of resources trained in a broad range of service offerings to be well positioned to respond to our client requests as described below 

 we believe that the continued expansion of our service offerings will provide new sources of revenue reduce our reliance on any one technology initiative and foster longterm relationships with our customers by allowing us to better serve their needs additionally as part of our vision to continue our growth and anticipate our clients’ and the markets’ rapidly changing demands in the nearterm midterm and longterm we are investing in emerging digital opportunities which will transform client and user platforms to internet cloud and mobilebased experiences 

 9 

development around the latest technology developments most of our technical staff is trained in multiple technologies and architectures as a result we are able to react to clients’ needs quickly and efficiently redeploy our technical staff to support a variety of technologies also to develop and maintain this flexibility we have made a substantial investment in our competency centers so that the experience gained from particular projects and research and development efforts is leveraged across our entire organization through our investment in research and development activities and the continuing education of our technical personnel we enlarge our knowledge base and develop the necessary skills to keep pace with emerging technologies we believe that our ability to work in new technologies allows us to foster longterm relationships by having the capacity to continually address the needs of both existing and new clients 

 we have invested considerably in automation to improve process institutionalization across the organization for example we have built and deployed “cognizant 20” an intelligent delivery ecosystem which orchestrates processes methodologies and best practices driving effective usage of knowledge while providing a collaborative framework for our worldwide client service personnel our process framework has been extensively adapted to cater to different types of projects managed by the organization across different service lines such as application development managed services application testing bps and it is 

global delivery model  we have a fourtiered global architecture for service delivery and operations consisting of employees colocated at clients’ sites at local facilities or incountry delivery centers at regional delivery centers and at global delivery centers our extensive facilities technology and communications infrastructure facilitate the seamless integration of our global workforces this is accomplished by permitting team members in different locations to access common project information and to work directly on client projects this infrastructure allows for rapid completion of projects highest level of quality efficient use of clients’ technological resources and realtime access to project information by the onsite account manager or the client in addition for large projects with short time frames our offshore facilities allow for parallel processing of various development phases to accelerate delivery time key aspects of our global delivery model include 

 10 

 further development of longterm client relationships  we have strong longterm strategic relationships with our clients and business partners we seek to establish longterm relationships that present recurring revenue opportunities frequently trying to establish relationships with our clients’ chief information officers or other it and business decision makers by offering a wide array of costeffective high quality services approximately 971 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 were derived from clients who had been using our services at the end of 2013 we also seek to leverage our experience with a client’s it systems into new business opportunities a successful track record and indepth knowledge of a client’s processes and it systems gained during the performance of application maintenance services can provide us with a competitive advantage in securing additional maintenance development and other projects 

pursuit of selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances  we believe that opportunities continue to exist in the fragmented market in which we operate to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances we believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence service offering and capabilities more rapidly for example in 2014 we completed several acquisitions which we believe will accelerate our ability to provide multiservice integrated solutions to the healthcare industry and enhance our overall digital delivery capabilities we believe that our fourth quarter acquisition of trizetto the largest acquisition in our history broadens our offerings and creates an opportunity for us to crosssell our business process infrastructure management and consulting services to the trizetto clients where we currently do not have relationships more importantly we believe a greater longer term opportunity exists for us to combine trizetto’s platforms with our services and program management capabilities to create endtoend integrated platformbased solutions that bring together infrastructure applications the cloud and business process services during 2014 we completed three other acquisitions to strengthen our digital delivery capabilities across several industry groups 

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our services directly through our professional staff senior management and direct sales personnel operating out of our teaneck new jersey global headquarters and our business development offices which are strategically located in various metropolitan areas around the world the sales and marketing group works with our client delivery team as the sales process moves closer to the customer’s selection of a services provider the duration of the sales process varies depending on the type of service ranging from approximately two months to over one year 

customers 

the number of customers served by us has increased significantly in recent years as of december 31 2014  we increased the number of strategic clients to 271  we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate at least 5 million to 50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity accordingly we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment however no individual customer exceeded 100 of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services generally would require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  768  776 and 794 of our revenue respectively was from north american customers see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional financial information by geographic area 

for the year ended december 31 2014  the distribution of our revenues across our business segments was as follows 418  from financial services 262  from healthcare 204  from manufacturingretaillogistics and 116  from other

 item 1a risk factors 

factors that may affect future results 

we face various important risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition and as a result cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock  

risks relating to our business 

we face intense competition from other service providers 

we operate in intensely competitive industries that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards and changes in customer requirements the intensely competitive information technology consulting and business process services markets include a large number of participants and are subject to rapid change these markets include participants from a variety of market segments including 

 these markets also include numerous smaller local competitors in the various geographic markets in which we operate which may be able to provide services and solutions at lower costs or on terms more attractive to clients than we can our direct competitors include among others accenture capgemini computer sciences corporation genpact hcl technologies hp enterprise formerly electronic data systems ibm global services infosys technologies tata consultancy services and wipro in certain markets our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals there is a risk that increased competition could put downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services and in turn our operating margins similarly if our competitors develop and implement processes and methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices without adversely affecting their profit margins if we are unable to provide our clients with superior services and solutions at competitive prices or successfully market those services to current and prospective clients our business results of operations and financial condition may suffer 

our international expansion plans may not be successful if we are unable to compete effectively in other countries we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations additionally such companies may have longstanding or wellestablished relationships with desired clients which may put us at a competitive disadvantage if we fail to compete effectively in the new markets we enter our ability to continue to grow our business could be adversely affected in addition if we cannot compete effectively we may be required to reconsider our strategy to expand internationally as well as our intent not to repatriate our nonus earnings 

we may also face competition from companies that increase in size or scope as the result of strategic mergers or acquisitions these transactions may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers software companies and vendors and service providers which could result in the convergence of products and services if buyers of products and services in the markets we serve favor using a single provider of integrated products and services such buyers may direct more business to such providers which could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and in turn adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating margin may decline and we may not be able to sustain our current level of profitability 

our operating margin may decline if we experience declines in demand and pricing for our services an increase in our operating costs including imposition of new nonincome related taxes or adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition wages in india have historically increased at a faster rate than in the united states which has in the past and may in the future put pressure on our operating margins due to our offshore delivery model additionally the number and type of equitybased compensation awards and the assumptions used in valuing equitybased compensation awards may change resulting in increased stockbased compensation expense and lower margins 

further our operating margin and therefore our profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to recover for our services if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our operating margin and our profitability could suffer the rates we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 in addition if we are not able to maintain an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals our profitability may suffer our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 if we are unable to control our costs and operate our business in an efficient manner our operating margin and therefore our profitability may decline 

we could be held liable for damages or our reputation could suffer from security breaches or disclosure of confidential information or personal data 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and securely store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or data including personal data in addition many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses the theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our or our clients’ confidential information or other proprietary business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce marketplace acceptance of our services any failure in the networks or computer systems used by us or our customers could result in a claim for substantial damages against us and significant reputational harm regardless of our responsibility for the failure 

in addition we often have access to or are required to manage utilize collect and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data including personal data as a result we are subject to numerous us and nonus laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of personal data if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches controls or procedures with which we are responsible for complying with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data or if unauthorized access to or disclosure of data in our possession or control occurs we could be subject to liability and penalties in connection with any violation of applicable privacy laws andor criminal prosecution as well as significant liability to our clients or our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or privacy laws these risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloudbased offerings and services and store and process increasingly large amounts of our customers’ confidential information and data and host or manage parts of our customers’ businesses especially in industries involving particularly sensitive data such as the financial services industry and the healthcare industry unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data including personal data whether through breach of computer systems systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation or otherwise could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems and networks or those we develop or manage for our clients whether by our employees or third parties could result in negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation which could in turn have a material adverse affect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 healthcarerelated data protection privacy and similar laws restrict access use and disclosure of information and failure to comply with or adapt to changes in these laws could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as a service provider in the healthcare industry we are subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act or hitech which are federal laws that apply to firms that provide services to certain entities in the healthcare industry 

a portion of the data that we obtain and handle for or on behalf of our healthcare clients is subject to hipaa and we are required to maintain the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information in accordance with hipaa and the terms of our agreements with clients hitech increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against us and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal court to enforce hipaa’s requirements we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs to establish and maintain hipaarequired safeguards and if additional safeguards are required to comply with hipaa or our healthcare clients requirements our costs could increase further which would negatively affect our results of operations furthermore if we fail to maintain adequate safeguards or we inappropriately use or disclose individually identifiable health information we could be subject to significant liabilities and consequences including without limitation 

 laws and expectations relating to privacy security and data protection continue to evolve and we continue to adapt to changing needs nevertheless changes in these laws may limit our data access use and disclosure and may require increased expenditures by us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide services to our healthcare clients and in turn on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our revenues and operating results may experience significant quarterly fluctuations 

we may experience significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations among the factors that could cause these variations are 

 20 

as a result of these factors it is possible that in some future periods our revenues and results of operations may be significantly below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such an event the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on a few customers for a large portion of our revenues 

our top five and top ten customers generated approximately 122  and 213  respectively of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2014  the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a major customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year the loss of one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business results of operations and financial condition will suffer if we fail to enhance our existing services and solutions and develop new services and solutions that allow us to keep pace with rapidly evolving technological developments 

the information technology consulting and business process services markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions our future success will depend on our ability to develop services and solutions that keep pace with changes in the markets in which we operate we cannot be sure that we will be successful in developing new services and solutions addressing evolving technologies in a timely or costeffective manner or that any services and solutions we do develop will be successful in the marketplace our failure to address the demands of the rapidly evolving technological environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain and attract clients and our competitive position which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business results of operations and financial condition may be affected by the rate of growth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of technology spending by our clients 

our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients as well as their customers and suppliers in challenging economic environments our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities or may choose to use their own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm to perform the types of services and solutions we provide in addition many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel processes and infrastructures if the growth of technology usage in business or our clients’ spending on technology in business declines or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new technological solutions our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

most of our contracts with our customers are shortterm and our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if our clients terminate their contracts on short notice 

consistent with industry practice most of our contracts with our customers are shortterm a majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice and without significant early termination cost terminations may result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project including the business or financial condition of a client changes in ownership management or the strategy of a client or economic or market conditions generally or specific to a client’s industry when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to eliminate our associated costs in a timely manner consequently our operating margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected if we are unable to replace the lost revenue with other work on terms we find acceptable or effectively eliminate costs our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions we predominantly contract to provide services either on a timeandmaterials basis or on a fixedprice basis fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 355  of our revenues for the 12 months ended december 31 2014  and we expect that an increasing number of our future projects will be contracted on a fixedprice basis our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations and utilizing workforces with different skill sets and competencies across geographically diverse service locations our pricing cost and operating margin estimates for the work that we perform frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life 

of the contract there is a risk that we will underprice our projects fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future we may not be able to report our financial results accurately which may adversely affect our stock price and our business 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations require our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we have committed and will be required to continue to commit significant financial and managerial resources in order to comply with these requirements 

further we are required to integrate trizetto and other acquired businesses into our system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as may be the case with other companies we acquire prior to being acquired by us trizetto was not required to implement or maintain the disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are required of public companies and we cannot provide assurance as to how long the integration process may take 

internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls we may not have adequate accurate or timely financial information and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company or comply with the requirements of the sec or the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 this could result in a restatement of our financial statements the imposition of sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information any such consequence or other negative effect of our inability to meet our reporting requirements or comply with legal and regulatory requirements as well as any disclosure of an accounting reporting or control issue could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our business 

we may not be able to successfully acquire target companies or integrate acquired companies or technologies into our company and we may become subject to certain liabilities assumed or incurred in connection with our acquisitions that could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses including trizetto into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services the process of integrating an acquired company business or technology has created and will continue to create operating difficulties the risks we face include 

 although we conduct due diligence in connection with each of our acquisitions there may be liabilities that we fail to discover that we inadequately assess or that are not properly disclosed to us in particular to the extent that any acquired business or any assets thereof i failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations ii failed to fulfill contractual obligations to customers or iii incurred material liabilities or obligations to customers that are not identified during the diligence process we as the successor owner may be financially responsible for these violations failures and liabilities and may suffer financial andor reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected in addition as part of an acquisition we may assume responsibilities and obligations of the acquired business pursuant to the terms and conditions of agreements entered by the acquired entity that are not consistent with the terms and conditions that we typically accept and require we also have been and may in the future be subject to litigation or other claims in connection with an acquired company including claims from terminated employees customers former stockholders or other third parties any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

we cannot predict or guarantee that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates consummate any acquisition or integrate any acquired business any failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

system failure or disruptions in our communications or information technology could negatively impact our operations and ability to provide our services and solutions which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

to deliver our services and solutions to our customers we must maintain a high speed network of satellite fiber optic and land lines and active voice and data communications 24 hours a day between our main operating offices in india our other development and delivery centers and the offices of our customers worldwide any systems failure or a significant lapse in our ability to transmit voice and data through satellite and telephone communications could result in curtailed operations and a loss of customers which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business results of operations and financial condition could be impaired if we lose key members of our management team 

our future performance depends upon the continued service of the key members of our management team competition for experienced executive officers and other key employees in the industries in which we compete is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain key persons or that we will be successful in attracting and retaining replacements in the future the loss of any one or more of our executive officers or significant employees or the failure to attract integrate and retain additional talent could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or significant employees 

in addition our business could be harmed if any key member of our management team leaves our employment and joins one of our competitors currently we have entered into noncompetition agreements with the majority of our executive officers we cannot be certain however that the restrictions in these agreements prohibiting such executive officers from engaging in competitive activities are enforceable any defection by a key member of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

competition for highlyskilled technical personnel is intense and our ability to compete for and manage client engagements depends on our ability to attract and retain such personnel 

our ability to maintain and renew existing client engagements and obtain new business depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highlyskilled technical personnel so as to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in particular in order to serve client needs and grow our business we must attract train and retain appropriate numbers of talented people including project managers it engineers and other senior technical personnel who are able to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences we cannot guarantee that we will be able to train and assimilate new employees successfully in addition we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for professionals with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer we have subcontracted in the past and may continue to subcontract in the future with other service providers in order to meet our obligations to our customers if we are unable to attract and retain highlyskilled technical personnel our ability to effectively lead our current projects and develop new business could be jeopardized and our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our services and solutions 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our clients we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important financial opportunity by doing so or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines in addition the contracting practices of our competitors may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become standard in the marketplace if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide services and solutions and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the enforceable terms of our agreements we might face significant legal liability and our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients or other parties with whom we conduct business with respect to certain matters these arrangements can include provisions whereby we agree to hold the indemnified party and certain of their affiliated entities harmless with respect to thirdparty claims including matters such as our breach of certain representations or covenants our infringement of the intellectual property of others or our gross negligence or willful misconduct payments by us under any of these arrangements are generally conditioned on the client making a claim and providing us with full control over the defense and settlement of such claim it is not possible to determine our maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement if events arise requiring us to make payment for indemnification claims under our contractual 

indemnification obligations such payments could have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally our clients may perform audits or require us to perform audits and provide audit reports with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such clients especially when we process data belonging to them our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit in a timely manner we could also incur liability if our controls and procedures or the controls and procedures we manage for a client were to result in an internal control failure or impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements 

we may face difficulties in providing endtoend business solutions or delivering complex and large projects for our clients that could cause clients to discontinue their work with us which in turn could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have been expanding the nature and scope of our engagements and have added new service offerings such as consulting business process services systems integration and outsourcing of entire portions of it infrastructure across the industries we serve the success of these service offerings depends in part upon continued demand for such services by our existing and prospective clients and our ability to meet this demand in a costcompetitive and effective manner to obtain engagements for such endtoend solutions we also are more likely to compete with large wellestablished international consulting firms resulting in increased competition and pricing pressure accordingly we cannot be certain that our new service offerings will effectively meet client needs or that we will be able to attract existing and prospective clients to these service offerings 

the increased breadth of our service offerings has resulted and may continue to result in larger and more complex projects with our clients this requires us to establish closer relationships with our clients and achieve a thorough understanding of their operations our ability to establish such relationships depends on a number of factors including the proficiency of our professionals and our management personnel our failure to understand our client requirements or our failure to deliver services that meet the requirements specified by our clients could result in termination of client contracts and we could be liable to our clients for significant penalties or damages which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

larger projects often involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements these terminations cancellations or delays may result from factors that have little or nothing to do with the quality of our services such as the business or financial condition of our clients or the economy generally such cancellations or delays make it difficult to plan for project resource requirements and inaccuracies in such resource planning and allocation may have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our clients our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients including limited access to the credit markets insolvency or bankruptcy and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

if our clients are not satisfied with our services and solutions or if our reputation in the marketplace is damaged our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing clients our business model also depends on our account teams’ ability to develop relationships with our clients that enable us to understand our clients’ needs and deliver services and solutions that are tailored to those needs if a client is not satisfied with the quality of 

work performed by us or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client in particular clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors 

in addition negative publicity related to our client services or relationships regardless of its accuracy could adversely affect our business by inhibiting our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage due to actions or statements made by current or former clients that are dissatisfied with our services or work product as well as competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators former and current employees members of the investment community and the media damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements and in turn result in a loss of business adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts reduce the value and effectiveness of the cognizant brand name and reduce investor confidence in us any one of which could adversely affecting our business results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on third parties for certain software products 

certain of our software products contain components that are developed by third parties in addition we resell certain software products of third parties and we use thirdparty software products to deliver our services and solutions we may not be able to replace the functions provided by these thirdparty software components or products if they become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or with our services and solutions or if they are not adequately maintained or updated any defects in or significant interruption in the availability of these thirdparty software products or components could harm the sale of our products and our delivery of services and solutions to our clients unless and until we can secure or develop an alternative source in addition thirdparty suppliers of software or other intellectual property assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired as a result of any such denial our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

alternate sources for the technology currently licensed to us may not be available to us in a timely manner may not provide us with the same functions as currently provided to us or may be more expensive than products we currently use further our success depends on our ability to maintain our existing relationships with thirdparty software providers and build new relationships with other providers in order to enhance our services and remain competitive if we are unable to maintain such existing relationships or successfully build new relationships our business results of operations and financial condition could suffer   

we are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio 

any deterioration of the credit and capital markets in the united states europe or other regions of the world could result in volatility of our investment earnings and impairments to our investment portfolio which could negatively impact our financial condition and reported income any decline in economic activity could adversely affect the ability of counterparties to certain financial instruments such as marketable securities and derivatives to meet their obligations to us 

our revenues are highly dependent on clients concentrated in certain industries including the financial services and healthcare industries consolidation and factors that negatively affect these industries may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

during the year ended december 31 2014  we earned approximately 418  of our revenues from the financial services industry which includes insurance and 262  from the healthcare industry significant consolidation or a decrease in growth in the financial services industry or the healthcare industry may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example two or more of our current clients may merge or consolidate and combine their operations which may cause us to lose work or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies may also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing regulatory economic and political conditions affecting the industries in which we operate we may be unable to effectively plan for or respond to those changes and our business results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected 

our revenues are highly dependent on clients located in the united states and europe any weakening of economic conditions in these markets may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

approximately 768  of our revenues during the year ended december 31 2014  were derived from clients located in north america in the same period approximately 184  of our revenues were derived from clients located in europe any weakening of economic conditions in the united states or european economies could depress the pricing for our services and cause our customers to reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we do not continue to improve our operational financial and other internal controls and systems to manage our rapid growth and size our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

our recent and anticipated growth including our acquisition of trizetto will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls in particular our growth will increase the challenges involved in 

 in addition the increasing size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that a member of our personnel will engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity breach our contractual obligations or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train our people and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

there can be no assurance that our business results of operations and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of indebtedness 

on november 20 2014 in conjunction with our acquisition of trizetto we entered into a credit agreement with a bank syndicate providing for a 10 billion unsecured term loan and a 7500 million unsecured revolving credit facility both of which mature on november 20 2019 we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which may be significant we will be required to have sufficient cash available in the united states to pay scheduled installments of principal accrued interest and fees from time to time and at maturity if we do not have sufficient cash available in the united states we may be required to repatriate earnings held by our foreign subsidiaries any such repatriation would cause us to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings at that time which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we may not have sufficient cash in the united states or abroad to make payments on our debt obligations which could cause us to seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our existing indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

in addition the credit agreement contains certain covenants including a requirement that we maintain a debt to total stockholders equity ratio not in excess of 040100 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter failure to comply with this covenant or other provisions of the credit agreement could result in a default under the credit agreement requiring us to either cure such default receive a waiver or in the absence of such cure or waiver refinance any outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement there is no assurance that we would be able to refinance our debt on acceptable terms and conditions 

risks relating to our international operations 

our global operations are subject to complex risks some of which might be beyond our control 

we have offices and operations in various countries around the world and provide services to clients globally in 2014  approximately 768  of our revenues were attributable to the north american region 184  were attributable to the european region and the remainder was attributable to the rest of the world primarily the asia pacific region we anticipate that revenues from customers outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the 

foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence particularly in europe the asia pacific region and the latin america region 

in addition the majority of our employees along with our development and delivery centers are located in india as a result we may be subject to risks inherently associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations difficulties in enforcing intellectual property andor contractual rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable international hostilities terrorism and natural disasters we may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india and we are subject to regulatory economic political and other uncertainties in india 

we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india where a majority of our technical professionals are located while wage costs are lower in india than in the united states and other developed countries for comparably skilled professionals wages in india have historically increased at a faster rate than in the united states and other countries in which we operate if this trend continues in the future it would result in increased costs for our skilled professionals and thereby potentially reduce our operating margins also there is no assurance that in future periods competition for skilled professionals will not drive salaries higher in india thereby resulting in increased costs for our technical professionals and reduced operating margins 

india has also recently experienced civil unrest and terrorism and has been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries in recent years there have been military confrontations between india and pakistan that have occurred in the region of kashmir and along the indiapakistan border the potential for hostilities between the two countries has been high in light of tensions related to recent terrorist incidents in india and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment including events in and related to afghanistan iraq and syria if india becomes engaged in armed hostilities particularly if these hostilities are protracted or involve the threat of or use of weapons of mass destruction it is likely that our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 

in the past the indian economy has experienced many of the problems that commonly confront the economies of developing countries including high inflation erratic gross domestic product growth and shortages of foreign exchange the indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy and indian government actions concerning the economy could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities like us in the past the indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy including the software development services industry changes in government leadership in india or a change in policies of the existing government in india that results in the elimination of any of the benefits realized by us from our indian operations or the imposition of new taxes applicable to such operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the indian rupee and other foreign currency exchange rates restrictions on the deployment of cash across our global operations and our use of derivative financial instruments 

although we report our operating results in us dollars a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues income from operations net income and the value of balance sheet items originally denominated in other currencies there is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations in addition in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which could limit our ability to use these funds across our global operations further as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee against the us dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain rupee denominated payments in india these contracts are intended to partially offset the impact of the movement of the exchange rates on future operating costs in addition we have also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to 

mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign currency denominated net monetary assets the hedging strategies that we have implemented or may in the future implement to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market operational and counterparty credit risks accordingly we may incur losses from our use of derivative financial instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violations of these regulations could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

because we provide services to clients throughout the world we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal rules on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations violations of these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business damage to our reputation and other unintended consequences such as liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

among other anticorruption laws and regulations we are subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which prohibits improper payments or offers of improper payments to foreign officials to obtain business or any other benefit and the uk bribery act violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions including fines and suspension or disqualification from government contracting or contracting with private entities in certain highly regulated industries any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

international hostilities terrorist activities other violence or war natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could delay or reduce the number of new service orders we receive and impair our ability to service our customers thereby adversely affecting our business results of operations and financial condition 

hostilities involving acts of terrorism violence or war natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat or perceived potential for these events could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to provide services to our customers such events may cause customers to delay their decisions on spending for information technology consulting and business process services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our personnel and to our and our clients’ physical facilities and operations around the world additionally by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to some or all of our clients the majority of our employees are located in india and the vast majority of our technical professionals in the united states and europe are indian nationals who are able to work in the united states and europe only because they hold current visas and work permits any inability to travel could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs and expenses or could impair our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

hostilities involving the united states the united kingdom india and other countries in which we provide services to our clients and other acts of terrorism violence or war natural disasters global health risks or pandemics may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues if we fail to defend against any of these occurrences we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks relating to taxes 

our earnings and financial condition may be negatively impacted by certain tax related matters 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods in addition our income tax returns are subject to examination in the jurisdictions in which we operate we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for 

income taxes an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these examinations may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate foreign earnings or if such earnings become subject to us tax on a current basis 

we earn a significant amount of our earnings outside of the united states other than amounts for which we have already accrued us taxes we consider foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur that could effectively force us to change our intent not to repatriate such earnings if such earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states or if legislation is enacted in the united states providing for a tax on foreign earnings or profits prior to their repatriation we may have to accrue taxes associated with such earnings or profits at a substantially higher rate than our projected effective income tax rate in 2015 these increased taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our earnings may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided by india to companies in our industry as well as by possible changes in indian tax laws 

our indian subsidiaries collectively referred to as cognizant india are primarily exportoriented and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the indian government for export activities conducted within special economic zones or sezs for periods of up to 15 years changes in indian tax laws that would reduce or deny sez tax benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition all indian profits including those generated within sezs are subject to the minimum alternative tax or mat at the current rate of approximately 210 including surcharges any mat paid is creditable against future corporate income tax subject to limitations currently we anticipate utilizing our existing mat balances against future corporate income tax our ability to fully do so may be influenced by possible changes to the indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of cognizant india our potential inability to fully utilize our deferred income tax assets related to the mat could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating to intellectual property 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other valuable intellectual property we presently hold a limited number of issued patents and we have filed and intend to file patent applications there is no guarantee that any patents will issue in the united states or in any other country we may seek protection or that they will serve as a barrier from competition from other organizations additionally the protection afforded by international patent laws as well as the enforcement actions differ from country to country there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain adequate protection or enforcement of our intellectual property rights 

we also rely upon a combination of copyright and trade secret laws nondisclosure and related contractual arrangements and other security measures to protect our intellectual property rights we believe that laws rules regulations and treaties in effect in the united states india and other countries in which we operate are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property however there can be no assurance that these laws will not change in ways that may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components libraries toolsets and other technology or data we use in the performance of our services and existing laws of some countries in which we provide services such as china might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights there also can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property 

unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in development of technology products or services that compete with our products and services and unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products services or proprietary information if we are unable to protect our intellectual property our business may be adversely affected and our ability to compete may be impaired 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed or used in connection with a contract than we normally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create and intend to reuse across multiple client engagements which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose 

revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

our ability to enforce our software license agreements service agreements and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries to the extent that we seek to enforce our rights we could be subject to claims that an intellectual property right is invalid otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are pursuing a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights may result in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights or assert other claims against us which could harm our business if we are not successful in defending such claims in litigation we may not be able to sell or license a particular service or solution due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations in addition governments may adopt regulations or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others or governments may require that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others third parties may assert against us or our customers claims alleging infringement of patent copyright trademark or other intellectual property rights to technologies or services that are important to our business infringement claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions in our contracts we generally agree to indemnify our clients for certain expenses or liabilities resulting from potential infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of our liability under these indemnities could be substantial any claims that our products services or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims may result in significant costs in defending and resolving such claims and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business in addition as a result of such intellectual property infringement claims we could be required or otherwise decide that it is appropriate to 

 the occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets which would reduce the value of our assets and increase expenses in addition if we alter or discontinue our offering of affected items or services our revenue could be affected if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages 

we expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our competitors are able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights for software products and methods technological solutions and processes we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals or companies that have acquired patent portfolios for the primary purpose of asserting such claims against other companies the risk of infringement claims against us may also increase as we continue to develop and license our intellectual property to our clients and other third parties any infringement claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating to legislation and government regulation 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted and negative perceptions associated with offshore outsourcing could impair our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in the united states which is our largest market as well as in europe the asia pacific and other regions in which we have clients for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by united states companies are periodically considered in the us congress and in numerous state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs domestically if enacted such measures may broaden existing restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource 

services directly or indirectly or impact private industry with measures that include but are not limited to tax disincentives fees or penalties intellectual property transfer restrictions mandatory government audit requirements and new standards that have the effect of restricting the use of certain business andor work visas in the event that any of these measures become law our ability to provide services to our customers could be impaired which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition existing and future legislative and administrativeregulatory policies restricting the performance of business process services from an offshore location in jurisdictions in europe the asia pacific or any other region in which we have clients could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as domestic job loss and theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data particularly involving service providers in india current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from utilizing global service delivery providers due to negative perceptions that may be associated with using global service delivery models or firms any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward global service delivery would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide the majority of their services from within the country in which our clients operate 

restrictions on immigration may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients which could hamper our growth and cause our revenue to decline 

our future success continues to depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills including those from developing countries especially india the ability of foreign nationals to work in the united states europe the asia pacific and other regions in which we have clients depends on their and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits for our personnel who need to travel internationally if we are unable to obtain such visas or work permits or if their issuance is delayed or if their length is shortened we may not be able to provide services to our clients or to continue to provide services on a timely and costeffective basis receive revenues as early as expected or manage our delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the countries in which we have clients are subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement for example the united states congress has recently considered and may consider in the future extensive changes to us immigration laws regarding the admission of highskilled temporary and permanent workers if such provisions are signed into law our cost of doing business in the united states would increase and that may discourage customers from seeking our services our international expansion strategy and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed 

 increased regulation of the financial services industry healthcare industry or other industries in which our clients operate could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

the industries in which our clients are concentrated such as the financial services industry and the healthcare industry are or may be increasingly subject to governmental regulation and intervention for instance the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation as a provider of services to financial institutions portions of our operations are examined by a number of regulatory agencies these agencies regulate the services we provide and manner in which we operate for example some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required our business may be harmed in addition clients in the financial services sector have been subject to increased regulation following the enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in the united states new or changing regulations under doddfrank as well as other regulations or legislation affecting our customers in the financial services industry may reduce demand for our services or cause us to incur costly changes in our processes or personnel thereby negatively affecting our business results of operations and financial condition 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the federal state and local levels and is subject to changing legislative regulatory political and other influences many healthcare laws such as the affordable care act are complex subject to frequent change and dependent on interpretation and enforcement decisions from government agencies with broad discretion the application of these laws to us our clients or the specific services and relationships we have with our clients is not always clear our failure to anticipate accurately the application of the affordable care act and similar or future laws and regulations 

or our failure to comply with them could create liability for us result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition further the growth of our business results of operations and financial condition rely in part on clients in the healthcare industry that receive substantial revenues from governmental and other thirdparty payor programs a reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs a change in allocation methodologies or the termination of our clients’ government contracts could negatively affect our clients’ businesses and in turn negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition in addition as a service provider to clients who are government contractors we may in the future become involved in governmental investigations to evaluate our or our clients’ compliance with government healthcare programs which could result in the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased regulation changes in existing regulation or increased government intervention in the other industries in which our clients operate also may adversely affect the growth of their respective businesses and therefore negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating to our common stock and governing documents 

our stock price continues to be volatile 

our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline 

provisions in our charter and bylaws and provisions under delaware law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals 

provisions in our charter and bylaws each as amended and delaware general corporate law or dgcl may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover proposals or delaying or preventing changes in our control or management including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices these provisions include 

 these provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

we are a leading provider of it consulting and business process services dedicated to helping the world’s leading companies build stronger businesses our clients engage us to help them build more efficient operations provide solutions to critical business and technology problems and help them drive technologybased innovation and growth our core competencies include business process operations and it consulting application development and systems integration eim application testing application maintenance it is and bps we tailor our services to specific industries and utilize an integrated global delivery model this seamless global sourcing model combines client service teams based onsite at the client locations with delivery teams located at dedicated nearshore and offshore global delivery centers 

we completed several acquisitions during 2014 that we believe will accelerate our ability to provide multiservice integrated solutions to the healthcare industry and enhance our overall digital delivery capabilities we believe that our fourth quarter acquisition of trizetto the largest acquisition in our history broadens our solutions offerings and creates an opportunity for us to crosssell our business process infrastructure management and consulting services to the trizetto clients where we currently do not have relationships more importantly we believe a greater longer term opportunity exists for us to combine trizetto’s platforms with our services and program management capabilities to create endtoend integrated platformbased solutions that bring together infrastructure applications the cloud and business process services during 2014 we completed three other acquisitions to strengthen our digital delivery capabilities across several industry groups 

we closed the acquisition of trizetto on november 20 2014 for an aggregate purchase price after giving effect to various purchase price adjustments and net of cash acquired of approximately 26278 million  in cash in connection with the acquisition we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with a commercial bank syndicate providing for a  10000  million unsecured term loan the term loan and  7500  million unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving facility we funded the purchase price for the acquisition of trizetto with cash on hand and the  10000  million of proceeds of the term loan 

in 2014  our revenue increased to 102627  million compared to 88432 million in 2013  net income increased to 14393 million or 235  per diluted share compared to net income of 12286 million or 202 per diluted share on a nongaap basis our 2014  diluted earnings per share increased to 260 1  compared to 227 1  during 2013  

the key drivers of our revenue growth in 2014  were as follows 

 

 

 38 

we saw a continued demand from our customers for a broad range of services including it strategy and business consulting application development and systems integration eim application testing application maintenance it is and bps in addition we are seeing increasing customer interest in digital solutions including our social mobile analytics and cloudbased services and increased demand for mobility data and security services we are also seeing an increase in demand for larger more complex projects that are transformational for our customers such contracts may have longer sales cycles and rampup periods and could lead to greater variability in our periodtoperiod operating results we increased the number of strategic clients by 28  during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 271  we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate at least 5 million to 50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity 

in 2014  our operating margin decreased to approximately 184  compared to 190 in 2013  our nongaap operating margin in 2014  was approximately 202 2 compared to 206 2  in 2013  the decrease in our gaap and nongaap operating margins was due to increases in compensation and benefit costs net of the impact of lower incentivebased compensation subcontractor expense and investments to grow our business partially offset by the impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar and lower realized losses on our cash flow hedges in 2014 compared to 2013 historically we have invested our profitability above the 19 to 20 nongaap operating margin level back into our business which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth this investment is primarily focused in the areas of hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise training our technical staff in a broader range of service offerings strengthening our business analytics and digital technology capabilities strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery as well as recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees in addition this investment includes maintaining a level of resources trained in a broad range of service offerings to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our targeted operating margin levels back into the business 

we finished the year with approximately 211500  employees which is an increase of approximately 40100  over the prior year and includes approximately 3770 employees from the acquisition of trizetto the increase in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs to meet the demand for our services is the primary driver of the increase in our operating expenses in 2014  annualized turnover including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 145  for the three months ended december 31 2014  the majority of our turnover occurs in india as a result annualized attrition rates onsite at clients are below our global attrition rate in addition attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff historically we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation costs in india which may continue in the future however historically this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs the mix of our professional staff as well as utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies 

at december 31 2014  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 37747 million  working capital of 41582 million   a nd debt outstanding under the credit agreement of approximately 16375  million the term loan and the revolving facility both mature on november 20 2019 as of december 31 2014  we have drawn down 6500  million under the revolving facility which is available for general corporate purposes we believe our cash from operations and capital resources on hand provide sufficient liquidity to continue to make investments to expand and grow our business and meet our repayment obligations under the credit agreement 

during 2015  barring any unforeseen events we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results 

 

 

 39 

in response to this environment we plan to 

 business segments 

our four reportable business segments are 

 our chief operating decision maker evaluates cognizant’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to different degrees expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development and delivery centers certain selling general and administrative expenses excess or shortfall of incentive compensation for delivery personnel as compared to target stockbased compensation expense a portion of depreciation and amortization and the impact of the settlements of our cash flow hedges are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker accordingly such expenses are excluded from segment operating profit 

we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for that segment however no individual customer accounted for sales in excess of 10 of our consolidated revenues during 2014  2013  or 2012  in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and we believe that a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues 

results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2014   

the following table sets forth certain financial data for the three years ended december 31 2014  

 

 revenue  overall  revenue increased by 161  to 102627 million  during 2014  as compared to an increase of 204 to 88432 million in 2013  in both years the increase was primarily attributed to greater acceptance of our global delivery model among an increasing number of industries continued interest in using our global delivery model as a means to reduce overall it and operations costs increased customer spending on discretionary projects and continued penetration in all our geographic markets revenue growth in 2014  includes 806 million from our november 2014 acquisition of trizetto revenues from new customers contributed 2981 million  and 2434 million representing 210  and 163 of the yearoveryear revenue growth for 2014  and 2013  respectively in 2014  our consulting and technology services revenues increased by approximately 221  and represented approximately 528  of total 2014  revenues while our outsourcing services revenue increased by approximately 100  and constituted approximately 472  of total revenues in 2013  consulting and technology services revenue increased by 183 and represented approximately 502 of total 2013  revenues while our outsourcing services increased by approximately 226 and constituted approximately 498 of total 2013  revenues 

revenues from our top five customers as a percentage of total revenues were 122  132 and 140 in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively revenues from our top ten customers as a percentage of total revenues were 213  226 and 250 in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively as we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline over time 

revenue  reportable segments revenues by reportable business segment were as follows 



revenue from our financial services segment grew 153  or 5680 million  in 2014  as compared to 2013  our banking and insurance customers contributed approximately 3441 million  and 2239 million  respectively to the yearoveryear revenue increase in this segment revenue from customers added during 2014  was approximately  496 million  and represented 87  of the yearoveryear revenue increase in this segment key areas of focus for our financial services customers included cost optimization regulatory and compliance driven initiatives risk management and the adoption and integration of digital technologies to align with shifts in consumer preferences revenue from our financial services segment grew 225 or 6821 million in 2013  as compared to 2012  this strength was driven by revenue growth of 4941 million from our banking customers who benefited from the improving economy in 2013  revenue from customers added during that year was approximately 753 million and represented 110 of the yearoveryear revenue increase in this segment 

revenue from our healthcare segment grew 187  or  4246 million  in 2014  as compared to 2013  during 2014 revenue growth was stronger among our healthcare customers where revenue increased by approximately  3403 million  as compared to an increase of approximately  843 million  from our life sciences customers revenue growth among our healthcare customers includes 806 million from our november 20 2014 acquisition of trizetto revenue from customers added during 2014  including new customers from our acquisition of trizetto was approximately 1581 million  and represented 372  of the yearoveryear revenue increase in this segment although discretionary spending by our healthcare customers recently has been negatively affected by uncertainty created by regulatory changes including the affordable care act initiatives in the united states we believe that the healthcare industry continues to present a growth opportunity in the long term additionally in 2014 it spending by some of our life sciences customers has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by the patent cliff affecting the pharmaceutical industry revenue from our healthcare segment grew 171 or 3299 million in 2013  as compared to 2012  in 2013  growth within the segment was driven by work related to affordable care act initiatives including extended support for member enrollment and the implementation of direct to customer programs through mobile platforms revenue from customers added during 2013  was approximately 304 million and represented 92 of the yearoveryear revenue increase in this segment

revenue  geographic locations  revenues by geographic market as determined by customer location were as follows 



  

north america continues to be our largest market representing approximately 768  of total revenue in 2014  and accounting for 10197 million  of the 14195 million  revenue increase in 2014  revenue growth among our north america customers includes 806 million from our november 20 2014 acquisition of trizetto revenue from europe grew 193  in 2014  driven by the increasing acceptance of our global delivery model revenue growth in 2014 for our rest of europe market includes the fullyear benefit of our acquisition of equinox consulting which closed in the fourth quarter of 2013  we believe the european market is underpenetrated and represents a significant future growth opportunity for us in 2013  revenue in europe grew 321  excluding approximately 935 million of revenue from our 2013 acquisitions of the c1 group companies and equinox consulting revenue from europe grew 243 in 2013  the 2013  revenue growth in europe was driven by the strength of europes economy and the increasing acceptance of our global delivery model revenue growth from rest of world customers in 2014  was primarily driven by the india singapore australia japan and hong kong markets in 2013  the revenue growth for rest of world was driven primarily by the middle east singapore and india markets we believe that europe the middle east the asia pacific and latin america regions will continue to be areas of significant investment for us as we see these regions as growth opportunities for the long term in 2015 we expect the recent strength of the us dollar to negatively impact our revenue from countries outside the united states primarily eurozone countries and the uk 

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense  our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries incentivebased compensation stockbased compensation expense payroll taxes employee benefits immigration and projectrelated travel for technical personnel subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues our cost of revenues increased by 166  or 8756 million  during 2014  as compared to an increase of approximately 231 or 9872 million during 2013  in both 2014  and 2013  the increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits costs in 2014  compensation and benefit costs increased by approximately 6506 million  as a result of the increase in the number of our technical personnel partially offset by lower incentivebased compensation costs in 2014  as compared to 2013  in 2013  the increase in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation was approximately 8702 million as a result of the increase in the number of our technical personnel and higher accrual of individual bonus payouts as compared to 2012 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries incentivebased compensation stockbased compensation expense payroll taxes employee benefits immigration travel marketing communications management finance administrative and occupancy costs selling general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization increased by 177  or 3369 million  during 2014  as compared to an increase of approximately 113 or 1931 million during 2013  selling general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue to 218  in 2014  as compared to 215 in 2013  and 232 in 2012  in 2014  the increase as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefit costs net of the impact of lower incentivebased compensation costs professional services including acquisitionrelated costs and investments to grow our business partially offset by the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar and lower realized losses on our cash flow hedges in 2014  compared to 2013  

income from operations and operating margin  overall  income from operations increased 123  or approximately 2070 million  in 2014  as compared to an increase of 232 or approximately 3164 million in 2013  our operating margin decreased to 184  of revenues in 2014  from 190 of revenues in 2013  due to increases in compensation and benefit costs net of the impact of lower incentivebased compensation subcontractor expense professional fees and investments to grow our business partially offset by the impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar and lower realized losses on our cash flow hedges in 2014  compared to 2013  in 2013  operating margin increased to 190 of revenues from 185 of revenues in 2012  due to revenue growth outpacing headcount growth and the impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar net of losses on our cash flow hedges partially offset by increases in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation costs excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges the 

depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 86  basis points or 086  percentage points in 2014  and 209 basis points or 209 percentage points in 2013  each additional 10 change in exchange rate between the indian rupee and the us dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 20  basis points or 020  percentage points 

we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain indian rupee denominated payments in india these hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the indian rupee during the years ended december 31 2014   2013  and 2012  the settlement of certain cash flow hedges negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately 133  basis points or 133  percentage points 184 basis points or 184 percentage points and 131 basis points or 131 percentage points respectively 

for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  our nongaap operating margins were 202 3  206 3  and 202 3  respectively as set forth in the “nongaap financial measures” section below our nongaap operating margin excludes stock based compensation expense and acquisitionrelated charges 

segment operating profit segment operating profits were as follows 



the increase in segment operating profit within all reportable segments during 2014  and 2013  was attributable primarily to increased revenues and the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar in each year partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting primarily from additional headcount to support our revenue growth and continued investments to grow our business in 2014  the unallocated costs increased when compared to 2013 due to continued investments to grow our business partially offset by the impact of lower incentivebased compensation accrual rates in 2014

other income expense net  total other income expense net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses interest income and interest expense the following table sets forth for the periods indicated total other income expense net 



the foreign currency exchange losses in all the years presented were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of the indian rupee denominated net monetary assets on the books of our indian subsidiaries to the us dollar functional currency as well as the remeasurement of other net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary the losses gains on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments relate to the realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts entered into primarily to offset foreign currency exposure to the indian rupee and other nonus dollar denominated net monetary assets as of december 31 2014  the notional value of our undesignated hedges was 2156 million  the increase in interest income in 2014  and 2013  was primarily attributed to the increase in average invested balances the 2014  increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to the interest on the term loan used to fund a portion of our acquisition of trizetto and on amounts drawn down under our revolving facility 

provision for income taxes  the provision for income taxes was 4848 million  in 2014  4593 million in 2013  and 3363 million in 2012  the effective income tax rate decreased to 252  in 2014  from 272 in 2013  primarily due to changes in the geographical mix of our current year earnings and discrete tax benefits recorded in 2014 partially offset by a scheduled reduction of certain income tax holiday benefits in india in 2014 the effective income tax rate increased to 272 in 2013  from 242 in 2012  due primarily to a shift in the geographic mix of our 2013  earnings towards countries with higher statutory rates an increase in the india statutory rate effective april 1 2013 and a scheduled reduction of certain income tax holiday benefits in india in 2013 

net income  net income increased to approximately 14393 million  in 2014  from approximately 12286 million in 2013  and approximately 10513 million in 2012  net income as a percentage of revenues increased slightly to 140  in 2014  from 139 in 2013  in 2013  net income as a percentage of revenues decreased to 139 from 143 in 2012  as a result of the increase in the provision of income taxes and an increase in net foreign currency exchange losses partially offset by the increase in the operating margin 

nongaap financial measures   

portions of our disclosure including the following table include nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share these nongaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies in addition these nongaap measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap the reconciliations of cognizant’s nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures should be carefully evaluated 

our nongaap income from operations and nongaap operating margin exclude stockbased compensation expense and acquisitionrelated charges in 2014 we modified our definition of nongaap diluted earnings per share to exclude net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses in addition to excluding stockbased compensation expense and acquisitionrelated charges our definition of nongaap income from operations and nongaap operating margin remains unchanged 

we seek to manage the company to a targeted nongaap operating margin of 19 to 20 of revenues we believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the company provides enhanced transparency into 

the operating results of the company for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes we use nongaap financial information that does not include stockbased compensation expense acquisitionrelated charges and net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses for financial and operational decision making to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors therefore it is our belief that the use of nongaap financial measures excluding these costs provides a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance accordingly we believe that the presentation of nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share when read in conjunction with our reported gaap results can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 

a limitation of using nongaap financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap is that nongaap measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with gaap and exclude costs that are recurring namely stockbased compensation expense certain acquisitionrelated charges and net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses in addition other companies may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than us thereby limiting the usefulness of these nongaap financial measures as a comparative tool we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share to allow investors to evaluate such nongaap financial measures 

the following table presents a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to the most comparable gaap measure for the years ended december 31

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash generated from operations has historically been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to grow our business in addition as of december 31 2014  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 37747  million and additional available capacity under our revolving facility of 1000 million in 2014 we funded the acquisition trizetto with 18000 million of cash on hand and 10000 million of proceeds from the term loan we have used and plan to continue to use a combination of our cash flow from operations cash on hand and capacity available under our revolving facility for expansion of existing operations including our offshore development and delivery centers continued development of new service lines acquisitions of related businesses formation of joint ventures stock repurchases and general corporate purposes including funding working capital requirements 

the following table provides a summary of the major cash flows and liquidity trends for the three years ended december 31 



operating activities the increase in operating cash flow for both 2014  and 2013  was primarily attributed to the increase in net income the 2013  increase was also due to more efficient deployment of working capital trade accounts receivable increased to approximately 19687 million  at december 31 2014  as compared to approximately 16488 million at december 31 2013  and approximately 13457 million at december 31 2012  unbilled accounts receivable increased to approximately 3246 million  at december 31 2014  from approximately 2265 million at december 31 2013  and 1831 million at december 31 2012  the increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable during 2014  was primarily due to increased revenues we monitor turnover aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff 

in the fourth quarter of 2014  we modified our days sales outstanding calculation to net the uncollected portion of deferred revenue from our total accounts receivable balance our reported days sales outstanding have historically included trade accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts and unbilled accounts receivable our new methodology reduces these balances by the uncollected portion of deferred revenue for the purpose of calculating our days sales outstanding under this modified method our days sales outstanding as of december 31 2014  was approximately 70 days as compared to 70 days as of december 31 2013  and 69 days as of december 31 2012  under our historical method our days sales outstanding as of december 31 2014  was approximately 77 days as compared to 73 days as of december 31 2013  and 72 days as of december 31 2012  

investing activities  the increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2014  is primarily related to our payment for the acquisition of trizetto in 2014 in 2013  the increase in net cash used in investing activities when compared to 2012  was primarily related to higher net investment purchases and payments for acquisitions during 2013  as compared to the 2012  period partially offset by lower spending for capital expenditures in 2013  

financing activities  the increase in net cash provided by financing activities during 2014  compared to the use of cash in 2013  primarily related to proceeds from borrowings under the 2014 credit agreement in 2013 the decrease in net cash used in financing activities when compared to 2012  was primarily related to lower levels of repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program in 2013  

on november 20 2014 we entered into a credit agreement with a commercial bank syndicate providing for a 10000 million unsecured term loan and a 7500 million revolving facility the term loan was used to pay a portion of the cash consideration in connection with our acquisition of trizetto the revolving facility is available for general corporate purposes the term loan and the revolving facility both mature on november 20 2019 as of december 31 2014  we have drawn down 6500 million  under the revolving facility 

the credit agreement requires interest to be paid at either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate plus a margin the margin over the base rate is 000 and the margin over the eurocurrency rate ranges from 075 to 1125 depending on our debt ratings or if we have not received debt ratings from 0875 to 100 depending on our debt to total stockholders equity ratio under the credit agreement we are required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving facility which vary based on our debt ratings or if we have not received debt ratings our debt to total stockholders equity ratio we are required under the credit agreement to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the term loan 

the credit agreement contains certain negative covenants including limitations on liens mergers consolidations and acquisitions subsidiary indebtedness and affiliate transactions as well as certain affirmative covenants in addition the credit agreement requires us to maintain a debt to total stockholders equity ratio not in excess of 040100 as of december 31 

2014  we are in compliance with our debt covenants and have provided a quarterly certification to our lenders to that effect we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the credit agreement to borrow thereunder and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the remaining available capacity under the revolving facility as of december 31 2014  and through the date of this filing 

we intend to continue to use a portion of our available capital resources for stock repurchases during 2015 the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our openmarket share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including without limitation our stock price and other market conditions our ongoing capital allocation planning the levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic andor business conditions and board and management discretion additionally as these factors may change over the course of the year the amount of stock repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time stock repurchases may be made from time to time through openmarket purchases and through the use of rule 10b51 plans andor by other means the stock repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time without notice 

we believe our us cash flows continue to be sufficient to fund our current domestic operations and obligations including debt service the amount of funds held in us tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business including debt repayments and due to other reasons such as acquisitionrelated activities the company’s us operations historically have generated and are expected to continue to generate substantial cash flows in circumstances where the company has additional cash requirements in the united states we have several additional liquidity options available to meet those requirements these options may include borrowing additional funds including borrowings under our committed revolving facility temporarily utilizing intercompany loans with certain foreign subsidiaries on a limited basis and while we currently do not have plans to do so repatriating certain of our foreign earnings we also believe we have access to the credit and equity markets and could borrow additional funds under acceptable terms and conditions or raise additional capital through an equity transaction 

many of our operations are conducted outside the united states and significant portions of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are held internationally as of december 31 2014  34333  million of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held outside the united states as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows and cash balances we utilize certain strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to income taxes in the united states less applicable foreign tax credits other than amounts for which we have already accrued us taxes we intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these amounts to fund our liquidity needs in the united states if such earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings at that time due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation 

we expect our operating cash flow cash and investment balances and available capacity under our revolving facility to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our longterm capital requirements beyond a twelve month period will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock our continued intent not to repatriate foreign earnings and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we cannot be certain that additional financing if required will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all 

commitments and contingencies 

as of december 31 2014  we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately 205 million  related to our india development center expansion program which includes expenditures for land acquisition facilities construction and furnishings to build new stateoftheart development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as sezs located in india 

as of december 31 2014  we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments 



  

 as of december 31 2014  we had 1356 million  of unrecognized tax benefits this represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution the resolution of these income tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india as of december 31 2014  these contracts were in a net unrealized loss position of 1026 million  and have settlement dates in 2015 2016 and 2017 the actual amounts at which these contracts will be settled may be significantly impacted by fluctuations in the indian rupee to us dollar foreign currency exchange rate prior to settlement therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period related to the settlement of these foreign exchange forward contracts 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in the opinion of management the outcome of any existing claims and legal or regulatory proceedings if decided adversely is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our clients including any breach involving a customer’s confidential information or sensitive data or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our services there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover all types of claims continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed or are not covered by our insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

foreign currency risk 

overall we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as approximately 768  of our revenues during 2014  were generated from customers located in north america revenue from our customers in the united kingdom and europe represented 107 and 76 respectively of our 2014  revenues accordingly 

our european operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate of the british pound euro swiss franc and other european currencies to the us dollar 

a portion of our costs in india representing approximately 250  of our global operating costs during 2014  are denominated in the indian rupee and are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations in addition a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may result in nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement in 2014  we reported foreign currency exchange losses exclusive of hedging gains or losses of approximately 165  million which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of the indian rupee denominated net monetary assets on the books of our india subsidiaries to the us dollar functional currency on an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to certain currencies in our foreign subsidiaries primarily the indian rupee 

we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses these hedges to buy indian rupees and sell us dollars are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs in 2014  we reported net losses of 1366 million  on contracts that settled during the year as of december 31 2014  we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of 24600 million  and weighted average contract rate of 648  indian rupees to the us dollar these contracts are scheduled to mature as follows 



our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk for transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary these contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2015  which are used to hedge our foreign currency denominated net monetary assets at december 31 2014  the notional value of the outstanding contracts was 2156 million  and the related fair value was an asset of 20 million  during 2014  inclusive of losses of 39 million  on our undesignated balance sheet hedges we reported net foreign currency exchange losses of approximately 204  million 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than our foreign exchange forward contracts there were no offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2014  2013  and 2012  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

effects of inflation 

our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals in certain regions competition for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation as with other service providers in our industry we must adequately anticipate wage increases particularly on our fixedprice contracts historically we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation in india however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future 

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities including the recoverability of tangible and 

intangible assets disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixedbid contracts the allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes assumptions used in valuing stockbased compensation arrangements derivative financial instruments and investments goodwill intangible assets and other longlived assets contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts which are predominantly fixedprice contracts are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting under this method total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost cost to cost method this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations changes in estimates related to our revenue contracts and contract losses were immaterial for the periods presented 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative creditworthiness of each customer historical collections experience and other information including the aging of the receivables if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

income taxes  determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and related valuation allowance if any and liabilities requires significant judgment we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate the consolidated provision for income taxes may also change period to period based on nonrecurring events such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of reserves established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related interest which can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit to the extent that the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies if it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred income tax asset will not be realized a valuation allowance is provided in the event we change our determination as to the amount of deferred income tax assets that can be realized we will adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact recorded to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 

our indian subsidiaries collectively referred to as cognizant india are primarily exportoriented companies and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the government of india for export activities conducted within sezs for periods of up to 15 years our sez income tax holiday benefits are currently scheduled to expire in whole or in part during the years 2016 to 2024 and may be extended on a limited basis for an additional five years per unit if certain reinvestment criteria are met we have constructed and expect to continue to locate most of our newer development facilities in sezs our indian profits ineligible for sez benefits are subject to corporate income tax at the current rate of 3399 in addition all 

indian profits including those generated within sezs are subject to the mat at the current rate of approximately 210 including surcharges any mat paid is creditable against future corporate income tax subject to limitations currently we anticipate utilizing our existing mat balances against our future corporate income tax obligations in india however our ability to do so could be impacted by possible changes to the indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of cognizant india 

stockbased compensation  utilizing the fair value recognition provisions prescribed by the authoritative guidance stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised the expected volatility of our stock and the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited in addition for performance stock units we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period if actual results differ significantly from our estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

derivative financial instruments  derivative financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that each derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date our derivative financial instruments consist of foreign exchange forward contracts we estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange forward contract by using a present value of expected cash flows model this model utilizes various assumptions including but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows discount rates and credit risk factors the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

investments  our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of time deposits mutual funds invested in fixed income securities and us dollar denominated corporate bonds municipal bonds certificates of deposit commercial paper debt issuances by the us government us government agencies foreign governments and supranational entities and assetbacked securities the assetbacked securities included government national mortgage association gnma mortgage backed securities and securities backed by auto loans credit card receivables and other receivables the years of issuance of our assetbacked securities fall in the 2005 to 2014 range 

we utilize various inputs to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio to the extent they exist unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets level 1 or quoted prices on similar assets level 2 are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in the absence of quoted prices or liquid markets valuation techniques would be used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable level 3 valuation techniques are based on various assumptions including but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows discount rates rate of return and adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity a significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using level 3 inputs the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our security valuation methodologies 

we periodically evaluate if unrealized losses as determined based on the security valuation methodologies discussed above on individual securities classified as availableforsale in the investment portfolio are considered to be otherthantemporary the analysis of otherthantemporary impairment requires the use of various assumptions including but not limited to the length of time an investment’s book value is greater than fair value the severity of the investment’s decline any credit deterioration of the investment whether management intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is generally recorded to income and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

business combinations  the application of business combination accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions we account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the allocation of the purchase price utilizes significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets the significant estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to the timing and amount of future revenue and cash flows based on among other things anticipated growth rates and customer attrition rates and the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows 

longlived assets and finitelived intangibles  we review longlived assets and certain finitelived identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not 

be recoverable in general we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset if such assets were determined to be impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles  we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant when determining the fair value of our reporting units we utilize various assumptions including discount rates and projections of future cash flows any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge based upon our most recent valuation of goodwill there are no significant risks of impairment for any of our reporting units as of december 31 2014  our goodwill balance was 24136 million  

recently adopted accounting pronouncement 

in july 2013 the fasb issued new guidance which requires the netting of any unrecognized tax benefits against all available samejurisdiction deferred income tax carryforward assets that would apply if the uncertain tax positions were settled we adopted this standard on january 1 2014 as of december 31 2014  we netted an unrecognized tax benefit of 94784  against samejurisdiction noncurrent deferred income tax assets in our december 31 2013 consolidated statement of financial position we reclassified 74196 from other noncurrent liabilities to noncurrent deferred income tax assets net to conform to current periods presentation the adoption of this standard had no effect on our consolidated results of operations or stockholders equity 

new accounting pronouncement 

in may 2014 the fasb issued a standard on revenue from contracts with customers the new standard sets forth a single comprehensive model for recognizing and reporting revenue the standard also requires additional financial statement disclosures that will enable users to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts the new standard will be effective for periods beginning on or after january 1 2017 early adoption is not permitted the standard allows for two methods of adoption the full retrospective adoption which requires the standard to be applied to each prior period presented or the modified retrospective adoption which requires the cumulative effect of adoption to be recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption we are currently evaluating the effect the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses these us dollar  indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs as of december 31 2014  the notional value and weighted average contract rates of these contracts were as follows 



as of december 31 2014  the net unrealized loss on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was 1026 million  based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2014  which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 2223 million  

our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk for transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary these contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2015  which are used to hedge our foreign currency denominated net monetary assets at december 31 2014  the notional value of the outstanding contracts was 2156 million  and the related fair value was an asset of 20 million  based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2014  which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 211 million  

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we entered into the credit agreement providing for a 1000 million  unsecured term loan and a 7500 million  unsecured revolving facility the term loan and the revolving facility both mature on november 20 2019 as of december 31 2014  we have drawn down 6500 million  under the revolving facility the credit agreement requires interest to be paid at either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate plus a margin the margin over the base rate is 000  and the margin over the eurocurrency rate ranges from 075  to 1125  depending on our debt ratings or if we have not received debt ratings from 0875 to 100  depending on our debt to total stockholders equity ratio thus our debt exposes us to market risk from changes in interest rates we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our interest expense a 10  change in interest rates with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a 15  change to our reported interest expense 

in addition our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are subject to market risk from changes in interest rates as of december 31 2014  a 10 change in interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a change in the fair market value of our availableforsale investment securities of approximately 19 million 

information provided by the sensitivity analysis does not necessarily represent the actual changes that would occur under normal market conditions 

we typically invest in highlyrated securities and our policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss we may sell our investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes in anticipation of credit deterioration or for duration management as of december 31 2014  our shortterm investments totaled 17646  million our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of time deposits mutual funds invested in fixed income securities and us dollar denominated corporate bonds municipal bonds certificates of deposit commercial paper debt issuances by the us government us government agencies foreign governments and supranational entities and assetbacked securities the assetbacked securities included government national mortgage association gnma mortgage backed securities and securities backed by auto loans credit card receivables and other receivables

 outsourcing services 

 

 by supporting some or all of a client’s applications our services help ensure that a user’s core operational systems are free of defects and responsive to changing needs as part of this process we are often able to introduce product and process enhancements and improve service levels to customers requesting modifications and ongoing support we also provide application value management solutions that can help balance cost complexity and capacity and can help clients reduce cost of ownership improve service levels and create new operational efficiencies 

  

our global delivery business model enables us to provide a range of rapid response and costeffective support services to our clients our onsite team members often provide helpdesk services at the client’s facility these team members typically are available in the event of an emergency service request and are able to quickly resolve customer problems from remote locations in the case of more complex maintenance services including modifications enhancements and documentation which typically have longer turnaround times we take full advantage of our offshore resources to develop solutions more costeffectively than would be possible relying on higher cost local professionals 

as part of our application maintenance services we assist clients in renovating their core systems to meet the requirements imposed by new regulations new standards or other external events we seek to anticipate the operational environment of our clients’ it systems as we design and develop such systems we also offer diagnostic services to clients to assist them in identifying shortcomings in their it systems and optimizing the performance of their systems 

 

  

 business strategies 

our objectives are to maximize stockholder value and enhance our position as a leading provider of information technology consulting and business process services we implement the following core strategies to achieve these objectives 

growth through reinvestment  we aim to invest our profits above the 19 to 20 nongaap operating margin level excluding stockbased compensation expense and acquisitionrelated charges back into our business we believe this to be a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth this investment is primarily focused in the areas of strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise training our technical staff in a broader range of service offerings recognizing and 

  

rewarding exceptional performance by our employees and maintaining a level of resources trained in a broad range of service offerings to be well positioned to respond to our client requests as described below 

 

 we believe that the continued expansion of our service offerings will provide new sources of revenue reduce our reliance on any one technology initiative and help foster longterm relationships with our customers by allowing us to better serve their needs additionally as part of our vision to continue our growth and anticipate our clients’ and the markets’ rapidly changing demands in the nearterm midterm and longterm we are investing in emerging opportunities which seek to transform client and user platforms to internet cloud and mobilebased experiences 

 

  

  

   

we have invested considerably in automation to improve process institutionalization across the organization for example we have built and deployed “cognizant 20” an intelligent delivery ecosystem which orchestrates processes methodologies and best practices driving effective usage of knowledge while providing a collaborative framework for our worldwide client service personnel our process framework has been extensively adapted to cater to different types of projects managed by the organization across different service lines such as application development managed services application testing bps and it is 

global delivery model we have a fourtiered global architecture for service delivery and operations consisting of employees colocated at clients’ sites local or incountry delivery centers regional delivery centers and global delivery centers our extensive facilities technology and communications infrastructure facilitate the seamless integration of our global workforces this is accomplished by permitting team members in different locations to access common project information and to work directly on client projects this infrastructure allows for rapid completion of projects highest level of quality efficient use of clients’ technological resources and realtime access to project information by the onsite account manager or the client in addition for large projects with short time frames our offshore facilities allow for parallel processing of various development phases to accelerate delivery time 

 

  

  

 further develop longterm client relationships  we have strong longterm strategic relationships with our clients and business partners we seek to establish longterm relationships that present recurring revenue opportunities frequently trying to establish relationships with our clients’ chief information officers or other it and business decision makers by offering a wide array of costeffective high quality services approximately 972 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 were derived from clients who had been using our 

  

services at the end of 2012 we also seek to leverage our experience with a client’s it systems into new business opportunities knowledge of a client’s processes and it systems gained during the performance of application maintenance services for example may provide us with a competitive advantage in securing additional maintenance development and other projects from that client 

pursue selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances  we believe that opportunities continue to exist in the fragmented market in which we operate to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances we believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence service offering and capabilities more rapidly for example in february 2013 we completed an acquisition of the c1 group companies this transaction expanded our local presence in germany and switzerland and deepened our expertise in enterprise application services and highend testing services in october 2013 we acquired equinox consulting a financial services consulting firm based in france in addition to expanding our presence in europe this transaction strengthened our financial services management and regulatory consulting practice 

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our services directly through our professional staff senior management and direct sales personnel operating out of our teaneck new jersey headquarters and our business development offices which are strategically located in various metropolitan areas around the world the sales and marketing group works with our client delivery team as the sales process moves closer to the customer’s selection of a services provider the duration of the sales process varies depending on the type of service ranging from approximately two months to over one year 

customers 

the number of customers served by us has increased significantly in recent years as of december 31 2013 we were providing services to approximately 1197 clients as compared to approximately 821 clients as of december 31 2012 and approximately 785 clients as of december 31 2011 as of december 31 2013 we increased the number of strategic clients to 243 we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate at least 5 million to 50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity accordingly we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment however no individual customer exceeded 100 of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services generally would require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 776 794 and 785 of our revenue respectively was from north american customers see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional financial information by geographic area 

for the year ended december 31 2013 we derived our revenues from the following business segments 420 from financial services 256 from healthcare 211 from manufacturingretaillogistics and 112 from other 

we generally provide our services on a timeandmaterial fixed price or pertransaction basis the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a significant customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year presented in the table below is additional information about our customers

corporate history

 item 1a risk factors tableend factors that may affect future results 

in addition to the risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

our global operations are subject to complex risks some of which might be beyond our control 

we have offices and operations in various countries around the world and provide services to clients globally in 2013 approximately 776 of our revenues were attributable to the north american region 179 were attributable to the european region and 46 were attributable to the rest of the world primarily the asia pacific region if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations including regulatory economic political and other uncertainties in india fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates international hostilities terrorism natural disasters and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india and we are subject to regulatory economic political and other uncertainties in india 

we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india where a majority of our technical professionals are located while wage costs are lower in india than in the united states and other developed countries for comparably skilled professionals wages in india have historically increased at a faster rate than in the united states and other countries in which we operate if this trend continues in the future it would result in increased costs for our skilled professionals and thereby potentially reduce our operating margins also there is no assurance that in future periods competition for skilled professionals will not drive salaries higher in india thereby resulting in increased costs for our technical professionals and reduced operating margins 

india has also recently experienced civil unrest and terrorism and has been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries in recent years there have been military confrontations between india and pakistan that have occurred in the region of kashmir and along the indiapakistan border the potential for hostilities between the two countries has been high in light of tensions related to recent terrorist incidents in india and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment including events in and related to afghanistan and iraq if india becomes engaged in armed hostilities particularly if these hostilities are protracted or involve the threat of or use of weapons of mass destruction it is likely that our operations would be materially adversely affected in addition companies may decline to contract with us for services in light of international terrorist incidents or armed hostilities even where india is not involved because of more generalized concerns about relying on a service provider utilizing international resources that may be viewed as less stable than those provided domestically 

in the past the indian economy has experienced many of the problems that commonly confront the economies of developing countries including high inflation erratic gross domestic product growth and shortages of foreign exchange the indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy and indian government actions concerning the economy could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities like us in the past the indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy including the software development services industry programs that have benefited us include among others tax holidays liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation notwithstanding these benefits as noted above india’s central and state governments remain significantly involved in the indian economy as regulators in recent years the indian government has introduced nonincome related taxes including new service taxes and incomerelated taxes 

  

including the minimum alternative tax or mat in addition a change in government leadership in india or a change in policies of the existing government in india that results in the elimination of any of the benefits realized by us from our indian operations or the imposition of new taxes applicable to such operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the emergence of a widespread health emergency or pandemic which may be more difficult to prevent or contain in a country like india as compared to more developed countries could create economic or financial disruption that could negatively affect our revenue and operations or impair our ability to manage our business in certain parts of the world 

our international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties 

revenues from customers outside north america represented approximately 224 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 we anticipate that revenues from customers outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence particularly in europe the asia pacific region and the latin america region in addition the majority of our employees along with our development and delivery centers are located in india as a result we may be subject to risks inherently associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may cause volatility in our reported income and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions from time to time we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate our risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations the use of hedging contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of our foreign operations but does not completely eliminate volatility and risk in addition the use of hedging contracts includes the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property andor contractual rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in addition we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations additionally such companies may have longstanding or wellestablished relationships with local officials andor desired clients which may put us at a competitive disadvantage we may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture our international expansion plans may not be successful and we may not be able to compete effectively in other countries there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not impede the success of our international expansion plans limit our ability to compete effectively in other countries or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the indian rupee and other foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on the deployment of cash across our global operations 

although we report our operating results in us dollars a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues income from operations other income expense net and the value of balance sheet items originally denominated in other currencies there is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations or that any efforts by us to engage in currency hedging activities will be effective in addition in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which could limit our ability to use these funds across our global operations finally as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of 

  

our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee against the us dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency 

our operating results may be adversely affected by our use of derivative financial instruments 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain rupee denominated payments in india these contracts are intended to partially offset the impact of the movement of the exchange rates on future operating costs in addition we also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign currency denominated net monetary assets the hedging strategies that we have implemented or may in the future implement to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market operational and counterparty credit risks accordingly we may incur losses from our use of derivative financial instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violations of these regulations could harm our business 

because we provide services to clients throughout the world we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal rules on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations violations of these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business damage to our reputation and other unintended consequences such as liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

among other anticorruption laws and regulations including the uk bribery act we are subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which prohibits improper payments or offers of improper payments to foreign officials to obtain business or any other benefit the fcpa also requires covered companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate these anticorruption laws or regulations although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance our employees subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these policies or procedures or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations furthermore the us government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability fcpa violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions including fines and suspension or disqualification from government contracting or contracting with private entities in certain highly regulated industries any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

international hostilities terrorist activities other violence or war natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could delay or reduce the number of new service orders we receive and impair our ability to service our customers thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

hostilities involving the united states and acts of terrorism violence or war such as the attacks of september 11 2001 in the united states the attacks of july 7 2005 in the united kingdom the attacks of 

  

november 26 2008 and july 13 2011 in mumbai india and the continuing conflict in the middle east and afghanistan natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat or perceived potential for these events could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to provide services to our customers such events may cause customers to delay their decisions on spending for information technology consulting and business process services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our clients which could affect our financial results by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to some or all of our clients as noted above the majority of our technical professionals are located in india and the vast majority of our technical professionals in the united states and europe are indian nationals who are able to work in the united states and europe only because they hold current visas and work permits travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

although we continue to believe that we have a strong competitive position in the united states we continue to increase our efforts to geographically diversify our clients and revenue despite our efforts to diversify hostilities involving the united states the united kingdom india and other countries in which we provide services to our clients and other acts of terrorism violence or war natural disasters global health risks or pandemics may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability while we plan and prepare to defend against each of these occurrences we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our operating results could be adversely affected 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted and negative perceptions associated with offshore outsourcing could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our customers 

the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest market for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by united states companies are periodically considered in the us congress and in numerous state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs domestically on august 13 2010 president barack obama signed legislation which imposed additional fees of 2000 for certain h1b petitions and 2250 for certain l1a and l1b petitions beginning in august 2010 through september 20 2014 these fees were later extended through september 20 2015 given the ongoing debate over outsourcing the introduction and consideration of other restrictive legislation or regulations is possible if enacted such measures may broaden existing restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly or impact private industry with measures that include but are not limited to tax disincentives fees or penalties intellectual property transfer restrictions mandatory government audit requirements and new standards that have the effect of restricting the use of certain business andor work visas in the event that any of these measures become law our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to provide services to our customers could be impaired 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as domestic job loss and theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data particularly involving service providers in india current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from utilizing global service delivery providers due to negative perceptions that may be associated with using global service delivery models or firms any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward global service delivery would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide the majority of their services from within the country in which our clients operate 

  

existing and future legislative and administrative regulatory policies restricting the performance of business process services from an offshore location in jurisdictions in europe the asia pacific or any other region in which we have clients could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example legislation enacted in the united kingdom based on the 1977 ec acquired rights directive has been adopted in some form by many european union or eu countries and provides that if a company outsources all or part of its business to a service provider or changes its current service provider the affected employees of the company or of the previous service provider are entitled to become employees of the new service provider generally on the same terms and conditions as their original employment in addition dismissals of employees who were employed by the company or the previous service provider immediately prior to that transfer are automatically considered unfair dismissals that entitle such employees to compensation as a result to avoid unfair dismissal claims we may have to offer and become liable for voluntary redundancy payments to the employees of our clients who outsource business to us in the united kingdom and other eu countries that have adopted similar laws these types of policies may materially affect our ability to obtain new business from companies in the united kingdom and eu and to provide outsourced services to companies in the united kingdom and eu in a costeffective manner 

our growth may be hindered by immigration restrictions 

our future success continues to depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills including those from developing countries especially india the ability of foreign nationals to work in the united states and europe depends on their ability and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits 

the h1b visa classification enables united states employers to hire certain qualified foreign workers in positions that require an education at least equal to a fouryear bachelor degree in the united states in specialty occupations such as it systems engineering and computer systems analysis the h1b visa usually permits an individual to work and live in the united states for a period of up to six years under certain limited circumstances h1b visa extensions after the sixyear period may be available there is a limit on the number of new h1b petitions that the united states citizenship and immigration services or cis may approve in any federal fiscal year and in years in which this limit is reached we may be unable to obtain h1b visas necessary to bring foreign employees to the united states currently the limit is 65000 for holders of united states or united statesequivalent bachelor degrees the general cap and an additional 20000 for holders of advanced degrees from united states postsecondary educational institutions cis announced on april 5 2013 that the agency had reached its general cap of 65000 h1b visas and its advanced degree cap of 20000 h1b visas for the fiscal year fy 2014 we will begin filing h1b petitions with cis against the fiscal year fy 2015 caps beginning april 1 2014 for work in h1b status beginning on october 1 2014 as part of our advanced planning process we believe that we have a sufficient number of employees who are work permitready to meet our anticipated business growth in the current year in addition there are strict labor regulations associated with the h1b visa classification larger users of the h1b visa program like us face additionalhigher legal and regulatory standards and are often subject to investigations by the wage and hour division of the united states department of labor dol and unannounced random site inspections by cis’s parent agency the united states department of homeland security dhs a finding by dol dhs and or another governmental agency of willful or substantial failure to comply with existing regulations on the h1b classification may result in backpay liability substantial fines and or a ban on future use of the h1b program and or other immigration benefits 

we also regularly transfer foreign professionals to the united states to work including work on projects at client sites using the l1 visa classification companies abroad are allowed to transfer certain managers and executives through the l1a visa and employees with specialized company knowledge through the l1b visa to related united states companies such as a parent subsidiary affiliate joint venture or branch office we have an approved “blanket l” petition under which the corporate relationships of our transferring and receiving entities have been preapproved by cis thus enabling individual l1 visa applications to be presented directly to 

  

a visaissuing united states consular post abroad rather than undergoing a preapproval process through cis in the united states in recent years both the united states consular posts in india that review initial l1 applications and cis which adjudicates individual petitions for initial grants and extensions of l1 visa status have become increasingly restrictive with respect to this category particularly the l1b “specialized knowledge” standard as a result the rate of refusals of initial individual l1 petitions and extensions for indian nationals has increased in addition even where l1 visas are ultimately granted and issued security measures undertaken by united states consular posts around the world have delayed or prevented visa issuances our inability to bring qualified technical personnel into the united states to staff onsite customer locations would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

pursuant to the l1 visa reform act we must meet a number of restrictions and requirements to obtain l1 visas for our personnel for example all l1 applicants including those brought to the united states under a blanket l program must have worked abroad with the related company for one full year in the prior three years in addition l1b “specialized knowledge” visa holders may not be primarily stationed at the work site of another employer if the l1b visa holder will be principally controlled and supervised by an employer other than the petitioning employer finally l1b status may not be granted where placement of the l1b visa holder at a third party site is part of an arrangement to provide labor for the third party rather than placement at the site in connection with the provision of a product or service involving specialized knowledge specific to the petitioning employer 

we do not place l1b workers at third party sites where they are under the primary supervision of a different employer nor do we place l1b workers at third party sites in an arrangement to provide labor for the third party without providing a service involving our workers’ specialized knowledge since implementation of the l1 visa reform act we consistently have established this fact to cis’s satisfaction however if cis and or the united states department of state through its visaissuing consular posts abroad decide to interpret these provisions in a very restrictive fashion this could impair our ability to effectively staff our projects in the united states with personnel from abroad new guidance governing these and related statutory provisions from cis is anticipated and if such guidance is restrictive in nature our ability to staff our projects in the united states with personnel from abroad will be impaired 

we also process immigrant visas for lawful permanent residence green cards in the united states for employees to fill positions for which there are an insufficient number of able willing and qualified united states workers available to fill the positions compliance with existing united states immigration and labor laws changes in those laws and or increase in governmental scrutiny making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting our ability to successfully obtain permanent residence for our foreign employees in the united states could require us to incur additional unexpected labor and or other costs and expenses and or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the united states any of these restrictions or limitations on our hiring practices could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to immigration restrictions in the united states there are certain restrictions on transferring employees to work in the united kingdom where we have experienced significant growth the united kingdom currently requires that all employees who are not nationals of european union countries plus nationals of bulgaria and romania or eea nationals obtain work permission before obtaining a visaentry clearance to travel to the united kingdom european nations such as hungary poland lithuania slovakia and the czech republic do not have a work permit requirement but employees need to register to work within 30 days of arrival the united kingdom has a pointsbased system under which certain certificates of sponsorship are issued by licensed employer sponsors provided the employees they seek to employ in the united kingdom can accumulate a certain number of points based on certain attributes where the employee has not worked for a cognizant group company outside the united kingdom for at least 6 months we must carry out a resident labor market test to confirm that the intended role cannot be filled by an eea national we are currently an arated sponsor and were allocated certificates of sponsorship which we believe are sufficient to meet our current and 

  

expected demand for transfers to the united kingdom on november 23 2010 the united kingdom announced new restrictions to control annual net migration but allowed for temporary intracompany transfers of employees from outside the european economic area for up to five years as long as the employees meet certain compensation requirements 

immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the united states the united kingdom the eu switzerland and other countries are subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement immigration and work permit laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity our international expansion strategy and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed 

our revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in the united states and europe as well as on clients concentrated in certain industries including the financial services industry continuing or worsening economic conditions or factors that negatively affect the economic health of the united states europe or these industries may adversely affect our business 

approximately 776 of our revenues during the year ended december 31 2013 were derived from customers located in north america in the same period approximately 179 of our revenues were derived from customers located in europe if the united states or european economy weakens or slows and conditions in the financial markets deteriorate pricing for our services may be depressed and our customers may reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability additionally any prolonged recession in the united states and europe could have an adverse impact on our revenues because our revenues are primarily derived from the united states and europe in addition during the year ended december 31 2013 we earned approximately 420 of our revenues from the financial services industry which includes insurance deterioration in the financial services industry or significant consolidation in that industry or a decrease in growth or consolidation in other industry segments on which we focus may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability in addition if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions affecting the industries and markets in which we operate we may be unable to effectively plan for or respond to those changes and our business could be negatively affected 

we face intense competition from other service providers 

we operate in intensely competitive industries that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards and changes in customer requirements the intensely competitive information technology consulting and business process professional services markets include a large number of participants and are subject to rapid change these markets include participants from a variety of market segments including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

these markets also include numerous smaller local competitors in the various geographic markets in which we operate which may be able to provide services and solutions at lower costs or on terms more attractive to clients than we can our direct competitors include among others accenture capgemini computer sciences corporation genpact hcl technologies hp enterprise formerly electronic data systems ibm global services infosys technologies tata consultancy services and wipro many of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals there is a risk that increased competition could put downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services and on our operating margins similarly if our competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices without adversely affecting their profit margins even if our offerings address industry and client needs our competitors may be more successful at selling their services if we are unable to provide our clients with superior services and solutions at competitive prices or successfully market those services to current and prospective clients our results of operations may suffer further a client may choose to use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm to perform the types of services we provide we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain our current levels of profitability or growth in the face of competitive pressures including competition for skilled technology professionals and pricing pressure from competitors employing an onsiteoffshore business model 

in addition we may face competition from companies that increase in size or scope as the result of strategic mergers or acquisitions these transactions may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers software companies and vendors and service providers the result of any such vertical integration may be greater integration of products and services that were once offered separately by independent vendors our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of such an industry trend which could adversely affect our competitive position these types of events could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results such as reducing our revenue increasing our costs lowering our gross margin percentage and requiring us to recognize impairments on our assets 

we may not be able to sustain our current level of profitability 

for the year ended december 31 2013 we reported an operating margin of 190 our operating margin may decline if we experience declines in demand and pricing for our services an increase in our operating costs including imposition of new nonincome related taxes or due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition historically wages in india have increased at a faster rate than in the united states additionally the number and type of equitybased compensation awards and the assumptions used in valuing equitybased compensation awards may change resulting in increased stockbased compensation expense and lower margins although we have historically been able to partially offset wage increases and foreign currency fluctuations through further leveraging the scale of our operating structure obtaining price increases and issuing a lower number of stockbased compensation awards in proportion to our overall headcount we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to control our costs or improve our efficiency 

our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency affects our profitability if we are unable to control our costs or improve our efficiency our profitability could be negatively affected 

our business will suffer if we fail to develop new services and enhance our existing services in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological environment 

the information technology consulting and business process professional services markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions our future success will depend on our ability to develop solutions that keep pace with changes in the markets in which we provide services we cannot be sure that we will be 

  

successful in developing new services addressing evolving technologies in a timely or costeffective manner or if these services are developed that we will be successful in the marketplace in addition we cannot be sure that products services or technologies developed by others will not render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to address the demands of the rapidly evolving technological environment could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to remain competitive will also depend on our ability to design and implement in a timely and costeffective manner solutions for customers that both leverage their legacy systems and appropriately utilize newer technologies such as cloudbased services web 20 models and softwareasaservice our failure to design and implement solutions in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may face difficulties in providing endtoend business solutions or delivering complex and large projects for our clients that could cause clients to discontinue their work with us which in turn could harm our business 

we have been expanding the nature and scope of our engagements and have added new service offerings such as consulting business process services systems integration and outsourcing of entire portions of it infrastructure the success of these service offerings is dependent in part upon continued demand for such services by our existing new and prospective clients and our ability to meet this demand in a costcompetitive and effective manner in addition our ability to effectively offer a wider breadth of endtoend business solutions depends on our ability to attract existing or new clients to these service offerings to obtain engagements for such endtoend solutions we also are more likely to compete with large wellestablished international consulting firms resulting in increased competition and marketing costs accordingly we cannot be certain that our new service offerings will effectively meet client needs or that we will be able to attract existing and new clients to these service offerings 

the increased breadth of our service offerings may result in larger and more complex projects with our clients this will require us to establish closer relationships with our clients and a thorough understanding of their operations our ability to establish such relationships will depend on a number of factors including the proficiency of our professionals and our management personnel our failure to understand our client requirements or our failure to deliver services that meet the requirements specified by our clients could result in termination of client contracts and we could be liable to our clients for significant penalties or damages 

larger projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements these terminations cancellations or delays may result from factors that have little or nothing to do with the quality of our services such as the business or financial condition of our clients or the economy generally such cancellations or delays make it difficult to plan for project resource requirements and inaccuracies in such resource planning and allocation may have a negative impact on our profitability 

if our clients are not satisfied with our services our business could be adversely affected 

our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing clients our business model also depends on our account teams’ ability to develop relationships with our clients that enable us to understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to those needs if a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client in particular clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors in addition negative publicity related to our client services or relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients 

  

we rely on a few customers for a large portion of our revenues 

our top five and top ten customers generated approximately 132 and 226 respectively of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a major customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year the loss of one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we generally do not have longterm contracts with our customers and our results of operations could be adversely affected if our clients terminate their contracts with us on short notice 

consistent with industry practice we generally do not enter into longterm contracts with our customers a majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice and without significant early termination cost terminations may result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project including the business or financial conditions of the client changes in ownership or management at our clients changes in client strategies or the economy or markets generally when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to eliminate our associated costs in a timely manner consequently our profit margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected if we are unable to replace the lost revenue with other work on terms we find acceptable or effectively eliminate costs we may not be able to maintain our level of profitability 

our results of operations may be affected by the rate of growth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of technology spending by our clients 

our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients as well as their customers and suppliers in challenging economic environments our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities at the same time many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel processes and infrastructures if the growth of technology usage in business or our clients’ spending on technology in business declines or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new technological solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our clients our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions such as the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system could also result in financial difficulties including limited access to the credit markets insolvency or bankruptcy for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we are investing substantial cash in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately 

we have made and continue to make significant contractual commitments related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our development and delivery centers we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability may be reduced 

competition for highlyskilled technical personnel is intense and the success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled professionals 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highlyskilled professionals so as to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in particular we must attract train and retain appropriate numbers of talented people including project managers it engineers and other senior technical personnel with diverse skills in order to serve client needs and grow our business we are particularly dependent on retaining our senior executives and other experienced managers with the skill sets required by our business and if we are unable to do so our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized similarly the profitability of our business model depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to support our projects the processes and costs associated with recruiting training and retaining employees place significant demands on our resources 

we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for professionals with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer we have subcontracted to a limited extent in the past and may do so in the future with other service providers in order to meet our obligations to our customers our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend in large part on our ability to attract train and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences further we must train and manage our growing work force requiring an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel we cannot guarantee that the management skills and systems currently in place will be adequate or that we will be able to train and assimilate new employees successfully our profits and ability to compete for and manage client engagements could be adversely affected if we cannot manage employee hiring and attrition to achieve a stable and efficient workforce structure 

our ability to operate and compete effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel or if we cannot attract additional qualified personnel 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of the key members of our management team as well as marketing sales and technical personnel and our ability to attract and retain new management and other personnel we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or significant employees competition for personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting and retaining new personnel in the future the loss of any one or more of our key personnel or the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

restrictions in noncompetition agreements with our executive officers may not be enforceable 

currently we have entered into noncompetition agreements with the majority of our executive officers we cannot be certain however that the restrictions in these agreements prohibiting such executive officers from engaging in competitive activities are enforceable further substantially all of our professional nonexecutive staff are not covered by agreements that would prohibit them from working for our competitors if any of our key professional personnel leaves our employment and joins one of our competitors our business could be adversely affected 

  

our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate foreign earnings or if such earnings become subject to us tax on a current basis 

we earn a significant amount of our earnings outside of the united states other than amounts for which we have already accrued us taxes we consider foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur that could effectively force us to change our intent not to repatriate such earnings if such earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested we may have to accrue taxes associated with such earnings at a substantially higher rate than our projected effective income tax rate in 2013 these increased taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our earnings may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided by india to companies in our industry as well as by possible changes in indian tax laws 

our indian subsidiaries collectively referred to as cognizant india are primarily exportoriented and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the indian government for export activities conducted within special economic zones or sezs for periods of up to 15 years changes in indian tax laws that would reduce or deny sez tax benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition all indian profits including those generated within sezs are subject to the mat at the current rate of approximately 200 any mat paid is creditable against future corporate income tax subject to limitations currently we anticipate utilizing our existing mat balances against future corporate income tax our ability to fully do so may be influenced by possible changes to the indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of cognizant india our inability to fully utilize our deferred income tax assets related to the mat could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our earnings and financial condition may be negatively impacted by certain tax related matters 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions the provision for income taxes and cash tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods in addition our income tax returns are subject to examination in the jurisdictions in which we operate we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these examinations may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions we predominantly contract to provide services either on a timeandmaterials basis or on a fixedprice basis our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations and utilizing workforces with different skill sets and competencies across geographically diverse service locations our pricing cost and profit margin estimates for the work that we perform frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract there is a risk that we will underprice our projects fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to 

  

accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our profit margin 

in addition a significant portion of our projects are contracted on a fixedprice basis subjecting us to the foregoing risks to an even greater extent fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 340 of our revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 we expect that an increasing number of our future projects will be contracted on a fixedprice basis in addition to the other risks described in the paragraph above we bear the risk of cost overruns and operating cost inflation in connection with projects covered by fixedprice contracts our failure to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a fixedprice project or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within the time frame committed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing rates 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to recover for our services if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our profit margin and our profitability could suffer the rates we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable utilization rates 

the cost of providing our services including the utilization rate of our professionals affects our profitability if we are not able to maintain an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals our profit margin and our profitability may suffer our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

if we do not continue to improve our operational financial and other internal controls and systems to manage our rapid growth and size or if we are unable to enter operate and compete effectively in new geographic markets our business may suffer and the value of our stockholders’ investment in our company may be harmed 

our anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources our growth will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls in the united states europe india and elsewhere in particular our continued growth will increase the challenges involved in 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the increasing size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that a member of our personnel will engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity breach our contractual obligations or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train our people and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired 

as part of our growth strategy we plan to continue expanding our operations in europe asia the middle east and latin america we may not be able to compete effectively in these markets and the cost of entering these markets may be substantially greater than we expect if we fail to compete effectively in the new markets we enter or if the cost of entering those markets is substantially greater than we expect our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we cannot compete effectively we may be required to reconsider our strategy to invest in our international expansion plans and change our intent on the repatriation of our earnings 

our operating results may experience significant quarterly fluctuations 

historically we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations and expect these fluctuations to continue among the factors causing these variations have been 

 

  

  

  

 in addition our future revenues operating margins and profitability may fluctuate as a result of 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 a high percentage of our operating expenses particularly personnel and rent are relatively fixed in advance of any particular period as a result unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects or in employee wage levels and utilization rates may cause significant variations in our operating results in any particular period and could result in losses any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations any material reduction in utilization rates for our professional staff or variance in the onsiteoffshore staffing mix an unanticipated termination of a major project a customer’s decision not to pursue a new project or proceed to succeeding stages of a current project or the completion of several major customer projects during a quarter could require us to pay underutilized employees and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as a result of these factors it is possible that in some future periods our revenues and operating results may be significantly below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such an event the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 

we could be held liable for damages or our reputation could be damaged by disclosure of confidential information or personal data security breaches or system failures 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and securely store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or data including personal data in addition many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify the theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our or our clients’ confidential information or other proprietary business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce marketplace acceptance of our services any failure in the networks or computer systems used by us or our customers could result in a claim for substantial damages against us and significant reputational harm regardless of our responsibility for the failure although we attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our services we cannot assure you that any such damages are subject to a contractual limitation or that any such contractual limitations on liability will be enforceable or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages 

in addition we often have access to or are required to manage utilize collect and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data including nonpublic personal data as a result we are subject to numerous us and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches controls or procedures with which we are responsible for complying with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data or if unauthorized access to or disclosure of data in our possession or control occurs we could be subject to significant liability to our clients or our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or privacy laws as well as liability and penalties in connection with any violation of applicable privacy laws andor criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through breach of computer 

  

systems systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation or otherwise could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems and networks or those we develop or manage for our clients whether by our employees or third parties could result in negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation 

although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that our coverage will cover all claims continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be sufficient in amount to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed or are not covered by our insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability including with respect to our contractual obligations in connection with providing our solutions and services 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our clients we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important economic opportunity by doing so or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines in addition the contracting practices of our competitors may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become standard in the marketplace if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope andor amount of our potential liability if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide solutions and services and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the enforceable terms of our agreements we might face significant legal liability and our business could be adversely affected 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients or other parties with whom we conduct business with respect to certain matters these arrangements can include provisions whereby we agree to hold the indemnified party and certain of their affiliated entities harmless with respect to thirdparty claims related to such matters as our breach of certain representations or covenants or out of our intellectual property infringement our gross negligence or willful misconduct or certain other claims made against certain parties payments by us under any of these arrangements are generally conditioned on the client making a claim and providing us with full control over the defense and settlement of such claim it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically we have not made payments under these indemnification agreements so they have not had any impact on our operating results financial position or cash flows however if events arise requiring us to make payment for indemnification claims under our indemnification obligations in contracts we have entered such payments could have a material impact on our operating results financial position and cash flows 

we could incur liability or our reputation could be damaged if our provision of services and solutions to our clients contributes to our clients’ internal control deficiencies 

our clients may perform audits or require us to perform audits and provide audit reports with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such clients especially when we process data belonging to them our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit in a timely manner additionally we could incur liability if our controls and procedures or the controls and procedures we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures or impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements 

  

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other valuable intellectual property we presently hold no issued patents however we have filed patent applications and we intend to file additional patent applications there is no guarantee that any patents will issue in the united states or in any other country we may seek protection or that they will serve as a barrier from competition from other organizations additionally the protection afforded by international patent laws as well as the enforcement actions differ from country to country there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain adequate protection or enforcement of our intellectual property rights 

we also rely upon a combination of copyright and trade secret laws nondisclosure and related contractual arrangements and other security measures to protect our intellectual property rights existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions such as china might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights india is a member of the berne convention and has agreed to recognize protections on copyrights conferred under the laws of foreign countries including the laws of the united states we believe that laws rules regulations and treaties in effect in the united states india and other countries in which we operate are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property however there can be no assurance that these laws will not change in ways that may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components libraries and toolsets and other technology or data we use in the performance of our services among the countries in which we operate and provide services there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of any of our intellectual property or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight 

unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in development of technology products or services that compete with our products and services and unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products services or proprietary information if we are unable to protect our intellectual property our business may be adversely affected and our ability to compete may be impaired 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed or used in connection with a contract than we normally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create and intend to reuse across multiple client engagements which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

our ability to enforce our software license agreements service agreements and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries to the extent that we seek to enforce our rights we could be subject to claims that an intellectual property right is invalid otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are pursuing a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights may result in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights or assert other claims against us which could harm our business if we are not successful in defending such claims in litigation we may not be able to sell or license a particular service or solution due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations in addition governments may adopt regulations or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others or governments may require that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

  

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others third parties may assert against us or our customers claims alleging infringement of patent copyright trademark or other intellectual property rights to technologies or services that are important to our business infringement claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions in our contracts we generally agree to indemnify our clients for certain expenses or liabilities resulting from potential infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of our liability under these indemnities could be substantial any claims that our products services or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims may result in significant costs in defending and resolving such claims and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business in addition as a result of such intellectual property infringement claims we could be required or otherwise decide that it is appropriate to 

 

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets which would reduce the value of our assets and increase expenses in addition if we alter or discontinue our offering of affected items or services our revenue could be affected if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages 

we expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our competitors are able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights for software products and methods technological solutions and processes we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals or companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the primary purpose of asserting such claims against other companies the risk of infringement claims against us may also increase as we continue to develop and license our intellectual property to our clients and other third parties any infringement claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others which could harm our business 

we could lose our ability or be unable to secure the right to utilize the intellectual property of others thirdparty suppliers of software hardware or other intellectual property assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired as a result of any such denial our operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to successfully acquire target companies or integrate acquired companies or technologies into our company and we may become subject to certain liabilities assumed or incurred in connection with our acquisitions that could harm our operating results 

if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our 

  

planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services we expect to continue pursuing strategic acquisition and joint venture opportunities designed to enhance our capabilities expand our capacity and geographic presence andor enter new technology areas we cannot predict or guarantee that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate any acquisition or joint venture we may need to divert andor dedicate management and other resources to complete the transactions once we have consummated an acquisition transaction or entered into a joint venture transaction we may not be able to integrate the acquired business or joint venture and personnel into our operations recognize anticipated efficiencies andor benefits realize our strategic objectives or achieve the desired financial and operating results in each case both generally and as a result of our unique organizational structure acquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key personnel and the potential assumption or incurrence of liabilities andor obligations 

although we conduct due diligence in connection with each of our acquisitions there may be liabilities that we fail to discover that we inadequately assess in our due diligence efforts or that are not properly disclosed to us in particular to the extent that any acquired business or any properties thereof i failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations ii failed to fulfill contractual obligations to customers or iii incurred material liabilities or obligations to customers that are not identified during the diligence process we as the successor owner may be financially responsible for these violations failures and liabilities and may suffer financial andor reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected in addition as part of an acquisition we may assume responsibilities and obligations of the acquired business pursuant to the terms and conditions of services agreements entered by the acquired entity that are not consistent with the terms and conditions that we typically accept and require although we attempt to structure acquisitions in such a manner as to minimize our exposure to among other things the factors and conditions contemplated by the foregoing two sentences including through indemnification protection we cannot predict or guarantee that our efforts will be effective or will protect us from liability the discovery of any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions for which we are unable to recover indemnification amounts could harm our operating results 

system failure or disruptions in communications could disrupt our business and result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

to deliver our services to our customers we must maintain a high speed network of satellite fiber optic and land lines and active voice and data communications twentyfour hours a day between our main operating offices in chennai our other development and delivery centers and the offices of our customers worldwide although we maintain redundancy facilities and satellite communications links any systems failure or a significant lapse in our ability to transmit voice and data through satellite and telephone communications could result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting systems integration and technology or outsourcing services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

our ability to attract and retain business may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors since many of our specific client engagements involve unique services and solutions our corporate reputation is a significant factor 

  

in our clients’ evaluation of whether to engage our services we believe the cognizant brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former clients competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators former and current employees and personnel as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about our company even if based on false rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business in particular damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the cognizant brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us adversely affecting our share price 

provisions in our charter and bylaws and provisions under delaware law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals 

provisions in our charter and bylaws each as amended and delaware general corporate law or dgcl may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover proposals or delaying or preventing changes in our control or management including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices in addition these documents and provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests our board of directors has the authority without further action by the stockholders to fix the rights and preferences and issue shares of preferred stock our charter provides for a classified board of directors until the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders at which point the board of directors will be declassified and each director will be elected on an annual basis while our board of directors remains classified a change of control of our board of directors cannot occur at a single meeting of stockholders the prohibition of our stockholders’ ability to act by written consent and the restrictions imposed on our stockholders’ ability to call a special meeting may have the effect of delaying stockholder actions until annual meetings or until a special meeting is called by our chairman or chief executive officer or our board of directors the supermajorityvoting requirement for specified amendments to our charter and bylaws allows a minority of our stockholders to block those amendments the dgcl also contains provisions preventing stockholders from engaging in business combinations with us subject to certain exceptions these provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock 

new and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements add uncertainty to our compliance policies and increase our costs of compliance 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to accounting corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 other sec regulations and the nasdaq global select market rules are creating uncertainty for companies like ours these laws regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such corporate governance standards 

in particular our efforts to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors’ audit of that assessment requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources we consistently assess the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting remediate any control deficiencies that may be identified and validate through testing that our controls are functioning as documented while we do not anticipate any material weaknesses the inability of management and our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy and effectiveness respectively of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

  

we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure and our efforts to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities in addition the laws regulations and standards regarding corporate governance may make it more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with their performance of duties as a result we may face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which could harm our business if we fail to comply with new or changed laws regulations or standards of corporate governance our business and reputation may be harmed 

our share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our stockholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls to ensure the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis or be unable to properly report on our business and the results of our operations and the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected 

we are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio 

recent turmoil in the financial markets has adversely affected economic activity in the united states europe and other regions of the world in which we do business we believe that based on our current cash cash equivalents and investment balances and expected operating cash flows the current lack of liquidity in the credit markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity cash flow or financial flexibility continued deterioration of the credit and capital markets could result in volatility of our investment earnings and impairments to our investment portfolio which could negatively impact our financial condition and reported income the continued decline in economic activity could adversely affect the ability of counterparties to certain financial instruments such as marketable securities and derivatives to meet their obligations to us 

our stock price continues to be volatile 

our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive summary 

we are a leading provider of it consulting and business process services dedicated to helping the world’s leading companies build stronger businesses our clients engage us to help them build more efficient operations provide solutions to critical business and technology problems and to help them drive technologybased innovation and growth our core competencies include business process operations and it consulting application development and systems integration eim application testing application maintenance it is and bps we tailor our services to specific industries and utilize an integrated global delivery model this seamless global sourcing model combines client service teams based onsite at the client locations with delivery teams located at dedicated nearshore and offshore global delivery centers 

in 2013 our revenue increased to 88432 million compared to 73465 million in 2012 net income increased to 12286 million or 403 per diluted share compared to net income of 10513 million or 344 per diluted share on a nongaap basis our 2013 diluted earnings per share increased to 438 1 compared to 374 1 during 2012 

the key drivers of our revenue growth in 2013 were as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we saw a continued demand from our customers for a broad range of services including it strategy and business consulting application development and systems integration eim application testing application maintenance it is and bps in addition we are seeing an increased customer interest in our social mobile analytics and cloudbased services we finished the year with approximately 1197 active clients compared to approximately 821 active clients as of december 31 2012 and increased the number of strategic clients by 29 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 243 we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate at least 5 million to 50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity 

our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of and strong demand for offshore it software and services and bps nasscom india’s national association of software and service companies reports indicate that export revenues from india’s it software and services and bps sectors are expected to grow approximately 12 to 14 for nasscom’s fiscal year ending march 31 2014 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 the industry recorded export revenue growth of 102 which was at the lower end of nasscoms growth projection 

 

   

in 2013 our operating margin increased to approximately 190 compared to 185 in 2012 our nongaap operating margin in 2013 was approximately 206 1 compared to 202 1 in 2012 the increase in our gaap and nongaap operating margins was due to revenue growth outpacing headcount growth and the impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar net of losses on our cash flow hedges partially offset by increases in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation historically we have invested our profitability above the 19 to 20 nongaap operating margin level back into our business which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth this investment is primarily focused in the areas of hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise training our technical staff in a broader range of service offerings strengthening our business analytics capabilities strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery as well as recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees in addition this investment includes maintaining a level of resources trained in a broad range of service offerings to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our targeted operating margin levels back into the business 

we finished the year with approximately 171400 employees which is an increase of approximately 14700 over the prior year the increase in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs to meet the demand for our services is the primary driver of the increase in our operating expenses in 2013 annualized turnover including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 145 for the three months ended december 31 2013 the majority of our turnover occurs in india as a result annualized attrition rates onsite at clients are below our global attrition rate in addition attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation costs in india which may continue in the future however historically this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs the mix of our professional staff as well as utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies 

at december 31 2013 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 37475 million and working capital of 43734 million accordingly we do not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues 

during 2014 barring any unforeseen events we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results 

 

  

  

  

  

 in response to this macroeconomic environment we plan to 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 business segments 

our four reportable business segments are 

 

  

  

  

 our chief operating decision maker evaluates cognizant’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development and delivery centers certain selling general and administrative expenses excess or shortfall of incentive compensation for delivery personnel as compared to target stockbased compensation expense a portion of depreciation and amortization and the impact of the settlements of our cash flow hedges are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker accordingly such expenses are excluded from segment operating profit 

we had approximately 1197 active clients as of december 31 2013 accordingly we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for that segment however no individual customer accounted for sales in excess of 10 of our consolidated revenues during 2013 2012 or 2011 in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and we believe that a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues 

  

results of operations for the three years ended december 31 2013 

the following table sets forth certain financial data for the three years ended december 31 2013 

dollars in thousands 

 

  

  revenue—overall revenue increased by 204 to 88432 million during 2013 as compared to an increase of 200 to 73465 million in 2012 in both years the increase was primarily attributed to greater acceptance of our global delivery model among an increasing number of industries continued interest in using our global delivery model as a means to reduce overall it and operations costs increased customer spending on discretionary projects and continued penetration in all our geographic markets revenues from new customers contributed 2434 million and 1365 million representing 163 and 111 of the yearoveryear revenue growth for 2013 and 2012 respectively our acquisitions of the c1 group companies and equinox consulting contributed to new customer revenue growth in 2013 in 2013 our consulting and technology services revenues increased by approximately 183 and represented approximately 502 of total 2013 revenues while our outsourcing services revenue increased by approximately 226 and constituted approximately 498 of total revenues in 2012 consulting and technology services revenue increased by 204 and represented 

  

approximately 511 of total 2012 revenues while our outsourcing services increased by approximately 196 and constituted approximately 489 of total 2012 revenues 

we had approximately 1197 active clients as of december 31 2013 as compared to approximately 821 and 785 active clients as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively revenues from our top five customers as a percentage of total revenues were 132 140 and 163 in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively revenues from our top ten customers as a percentage of total revenues were 226 250 and 277 in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively as we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to decline over time 

revenue—reportable segments revenues by reportable business segment were as follows 

dollars in thousands 

 

 revenue from our financial services segment grew 225 or 6821 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 this strength was driven by revenue growth of 4941 million from our banking customers who benefited from the improving economy in this segment revenue from customers added during 2013 was approximately 753 million and represented 110 of the yearoveryear revenue increase in this segment during the year key areas of focus for our financial services customers included cost optimization regulatory and compliance driven initiatives risk management and the adoption and integration of smac solutions to align with shifts in consumer preferences revenue from our financial services segment grew 205 or 5170 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 during 2012 our banking and insurance customers each almost equally contributed to the yearoveryear revenue increase in 2012 revenue from customers added during that year was approximately 355 million and represented 69 of the yearoveryear revenue increase in this segment 

revenue from our healthcare segment grew 171 or 3299 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 our healthcare and life sciences customers contributed approximately 2415 million and 884 million respectively to the yearoveryear revenue increase revenue from customers added during 2013 was approximately 304 million and represented 92 of the yearoveryear revenue increase in this segment growth within the segment was driven by work related to affordable care act initiatives including extended support for member enrollment and the implementation of direct to consumer programs through mobile platforms revenue from our healthcare segment grew 193 or 3127 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 in 2012 growth was driven primarily by our healthcare customers which contributed 2224 million to yearoveryear revenue growth revenue from customers added during 2012 was approximately 198 million and represented 63 of the yearoveryear revenue increase in this segment it spending by some of our life sciences customers has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by the patent cliff affecting some of our pharmaceutical customers 

revenue from our manufacturingretaillogistics segment grew 247 or 3696 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 during 2013 growth was stronger among our manufacturing and logistics customers where revenue increased by approximately 2000 million as compared to approximately 1696 million for our retail and hospitality customers revenue from customers added during 2013 was approximately 799 million and represented 216 of the yearoveryear revenue increase in this segment demand within this segment was 

  

driven by multichannel commerce implementation and integration efforts supply chain consulting and implementation initiatives and increased adoption of smac solutions revenue from our manufacturingretaillogistics segment grew 252 or 3012 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 in 2012 growth within this segment was stronger among our retail and hospitality customers where revenue increased by approximately 2190 million while revenue for our manufacturing and logistics customers increased by approximately 822 million in 2012 revenue from customers added during that year was approximately 578 million and represented 192 of the yearoveryear revenue increase in this segment 

revenue from our other segment grew 131 or 1150 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 in 2013 growth within other was particularly strong among our high technology customers where revenue increased by approximately 540 million due to an increase in discretionary spending revenue from customers added during 2013 was approximately 579 million and represented 503 of the yearoveryear revenue increase in this segment revenue from our other segment grew 120 or 944 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 in 2012 each of our operating segments within other including information media and entertainment services communications and high technology grew slower than the company average in 2012 revenue from customers added during that year was approximately 234 million and represented 248 of the yearoveryear revenue increase in this segment 

revenue—geographic locations  revenues by geographic location were as follows 

dollars in thousands 

 

 north america continues to be our largest market representing approximately 776 of total revenue in 2013 and accounted for 10238 million of the 14967 million revenue increase in 2013 revenue from europe grew 321 in 2013 excluding approximately 935 million of revenue from our 2013 acquisitions of the c1 group companies and equinox consulting revenue from europe grew 243 the strong revenue growth in europe was driven by europes economic recovery and the increasing acceptance of our global delivery model conversely in 2012 revenue in europe grew 89 yearoveryear and was negatively impacted by the economic downturn in europe during 2012 we believe the european market is underpenetrated and represents a significant future growth opportunity for us the acquisitions of the c1 group companies and equinox consulting significantly strengthen our local presence in germany and france revenue growth from rest of world customers in 2013 was primarily driven by the middle east singapore and india markets and in 2012 the revenue growth for rest of world was driven primarily by the singapore market we believe that europe the middle east the asia pacific and latin america regions will continue to be areas of significant investment for us as we see these regions as growth opportunities for the long term 

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries incentivebased compensation stockbased compensation expense payroll taxes employee benefits immigration and projectrelated travel for technical personnel subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues our cost of revenues increased by 231 or 9872 million during 2013 as compared to an increase of approximately 209 or 7396 million during 2012 in both 2013 and 2012 the increase was due 

  

primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits costs including incentivebased compensation in 2013 compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation increased by approximately 8702 million as a result of the increase in the number of our technical personnel and higher accrual of individual bonus payouts in 2012 the increase in compensation and benefit costs including incentive based compensation was approximately 6603 million and was due primarily to the increase in the number of our technical personnel partially offset by the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar net of the impact of our cash flow hedge losses 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries incentivebased compensation stockbased compensation expense payroll taxes employee benefits immigration travel promotion communications management finance administrative and occupancy costs selling general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization increased by 113 or 1931 million during 2013 as compared to an increase of approximately 180 or 2607 million during 2012 selling general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of revenue to 215 in 2013 as compared to 232 in 2012 and 236 in 2011 in both 2013 and 2012 the decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to economies of scale that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization and the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar net of losses on our cash flow hedges 

income from operations and operating margin—overall  income from operations increased 232 or approximately 3164 million in 2013 as compared to an increase of 198 or approximately 2250 million during 2012 our operating margin increased to 190 of revenues in 2013 from 185 of revenues in 2012 due to revenue growth outpacing headcount growth and the impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar net of losses on our cash flow hedges partially offset by increases in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation costs in 2012 operating margin decreased slightly to 185 of revenues in 2012 from 186 of revenues in 2011 due to continued investments to grow our business partially offset by the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar net of losses on our cash flow hedges and economies of scale that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 209 basis points or 209 percentage points in 2013 and 355 basis points or 355 percentage points in 2012 each additional 10 change in exchange rate between the indian rupee and the us dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 22 basis points or 022 percentage points 

for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 our nongaap operating margins were 206 2  202 2  and 203 2  respectively as set forth in the “nongaap financial measures” section below our nongaap operating margin excludes stock based compensation expense and acquisitionrelated charges 

we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain indian rupee denominated payments in india these hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the indian rupee during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 the settlement of certain cash flow hedges negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately 184 basis points or 184 percentage points and 131 basis points or 131 percentage points respectively during 2011 the settlement of certain cash flow hedges favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 31 basis points or 031 percentage points 

 

   

segment operating profit segment operating profits were as follows 

dollars in thousands 

 

  

 the increase in segment operating profit within all reportable segments during 2013 and 2012 was attributable primarily to increased revenues and the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting primarily from additional headcount to support our revenue growth and continued investment in sales and marketing 

other income expense net total other income expense net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses and interest income the following table sets forth for the periods indicated total other income expense net 

dollars in thousands 

 

 the foreign currency exchange losses in all the years presented were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of the indian rupee denominated net monetary assets on the books of our india subsidiaries to the us dollar functional currency the gains losses on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments relate to the realized and unrealized gains on foreign exchange forward contracts entered into primarily to offset foreign currency exposure to indian rupee denominated net monetary assets as of december 31 2013 the notional value of our undesignated hedges was 2793 million the increase in interest income in 2013 and 2012 was primarily attributed to the increase in average invested balances partially offset by the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar 

  

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was 4593 million in 2013 3363 million in 2012 and 2855 million in 2011 the effective income tax rate increased to 272 in 2013 from 242 in 2012 due primarily to a shift in the geographic mix of our current year earnings towards countries with higher statutory rates an increase in the india statutory rate effective april 1 2013 and a scheduled reduction of certain income tax holiday benefits in india in 2013 the effective income tax rate decreased slightly to 242 in 2012 from 244 in 2011 due primarily to favorable discrete items in 2012 partially offset by the scheduled reduction of certain income tax holiday benefits in india in 2012 

net income net income increased to approximately 12286 million in 2013 from approximately 10513 million in 2012 and approximately 8836 million in 2011 net income as a percentage of revenues decreased to 139 in 2013 from 143 in 2012 and 144 in 2011 in 2013 the decrease in net income as a percentage of revenues was a result of the increase in the provision for income taxes and an increase in net foreign currency exchange losses partially offset by the increase in the operating margin 

nongaap financial measures 

portions of our disclosure including the following table include nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share these nongaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies in addition these nongaap measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap the reconciliations of cognizant’s nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures should be carefully evaluated 

historically we sought to manage the company to a targeted operating margin excluding stockbased compensation expense of 19 to 20 of revenues beginning with 2013 we continue to seek to manage the company to the same targeted operating margin but we now also exclude acquisitionrelated charges in addition to excluding stockbased compensation expense in setting our internal operating targets we believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the company provides enhanced transparency into the operating results of the company for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes we use nongaap financial information that does not include stockbased compensation expense and acquisitionrelated charges for financial and operational decision making to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors therefore it is our belief that the use of nongaap financial measures excluding these costs provides a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance accordingly we believe that the presentation of nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share when read in conjunction with our reported gaap results can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 

a limitation of using nongaap financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap is that nongaap measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with gaap and exclude costs that are recurring namely stockbased compensation expense and certain acquisitionrelated charges in addition other companies may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than us thereby limiting the usefulness of these nongaap financial measures as a comparative tool we compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin and nongaap diluted earnings per share to allow investors to evaluate such nongaap financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap 

  

the following table presents a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to the most comparable gaap measure for the years ended december 31 

dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

 

  

 liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2013 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 37475 million we have used and plan to use such cash for expansion of existing operations including our offshore development and delivery centers continued development of new service lines acquisitions of related businesses formation of joint ventures stock repurchases and general corporate purposes including working capital as of december 31 2013 we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately 43734 million accordingly we do not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues 

the following table provides a summary of the major cash flows and liquidity trends for the three years ended december 31 

dollars in thousands 

 

 operating activities the increase in operating cash flow for both 2013 and 2012 was primarily attributed to the increase in net income and more efficient deployment of working capital trade accounts receivable increased to approximately 16488 million at december 31 2013 as compared to approximately 13457 million at december 31 2012 and approximately 11790 million at december 31 2011 unbilled 

  

accounts receivable increased to approximately 2265 million at december 31 2013 from approximately 1831 million at december 31 2012 and 1396 at december 31 2011 the increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2013 was primarily due to increased revenues we monitor turnover aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff at december 31 2013 our days sales outstanding including unbilled receivables was approximately 73 days as compared to 72 days as of december 31 2012 and 73 days as of december 31 2011 

investing activities the increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2013 is primarily related to higher net investment purchases and payments for acquisitions during 2013 as compared to the 2012 period partially offset by lower spending for capital expenditures during the year the 2012 decrease in net cash used in investing activities when compared to 2011 is related to a decrease in net purchases of investments and lower payments for acquisitions partially offset by higher spending for capital expenditures 

financing activities the decrease in net cash used in financing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 primarily related to lower levels of repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program in 2013 the increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2012 when compared to 2011 primarily related to higher levels of repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program 

as of december 31 2013 25109 million of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held outside the united states we utilize certain strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to income taxes in the united states less applicable foreign tax credits other than amounts for which we have already accrued us taxes we intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these amounts to fund our cash needs in the united states if such earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings at that time due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation 

our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our longterm capital requirements beyond a twelve month period will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock our continued intent not to repatriate foreign earnings and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we cannot be certain that additional financing if required will be available on terms favorable to us if at all we expect our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months 

commitments and contingencies 

as of december 31 2013 we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately 633 million related to our india development center expansion program which includes expenditures for land acquisition facilities construction and furnishings to build new stateoftheart development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as sezs located in india 

  

as of december 31 2013 we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

  

  as of december 31 2013 we had 966 million of unrecognized tax benefits this represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution the resolution of these income tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management the outcome of such claims and legal actions if decided adversely is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our clients including any breach involving a customer’s confidential information or sensitive data or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our services there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover all types of claims continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed or are not covered by our insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

foreign currency risk 

overall we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as approximately 776 of our revenues during 2013 were generated from customers located in north america however a portion of our costs in india representing approximately 273 of our global operating costs during 2013 are denominated in the indian rupee and are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations in addition a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may result in nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement in 2013 we reported foreign currency exchange losses exclusive of hedging gains or losses of approximately 552 million which 

  

were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of the indian rupee denominated net monetary assets on the books of our india subsidiaries to the us dollar functional currency on an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to certain currencies in our foreign subsidiaries primarily the indian rupee 

we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses these hedges to buy indian rupees and sell us dollars are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs we reported losses of 1630 million in 2013 and 961 million in 2012 on contracts that settled during these periods as of december 31 2013 we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of 23400 million and weighted average forward rate of 572 rupees to the us dollar these contracts are scheduled to mature as follows outstanding contracts with a notional value of 12000 million and a weighted average forward rate of 541 rupees to the us dollar scheduled to mature in 2014 outstanding contracts with a notional value of 9000 million and a weighted average forward rate of 586 rupees to the us dollar scheduled to mature in 2015 and outstanding contracts with a notional value of 2400 million and a weighted average forward rate of 672 rupees to the us dollar scheduled to mature in 2016 

our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk for transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary these contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2014 which are used to hedge our foreign currency denominated net monetary assets at december 31 2013 the notional value of the outstanding contracts was 2793 million and the related fair value was an asset of 99 million during 2013 inclusive of gains of 141 million on our undesignated balance sheet hedges we reported net foreign currency exchange losses of approximately 411 million 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than our foreign exchange forward contracts there were no offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2013 2012 and 2011 that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company’s financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

effects of inflation 

our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals in certain regions competition for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation as with other service providers in our industry we must adequately anticipate wage increases particularly on our fixedprice contracts historically we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation in india however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future 

critical accounting estimates and risks 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting 

  

principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixedbid contracts the allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets valuation of investments and derivative financial instruments assumptions used in valuing stockbased compensation arrangements contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts which are predominantly fixedprice contracts are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting under this method total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost cost to cost method this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations changes in estimates related to our revenue contracts and contract losses were immaterial for the periods presented 

stockbased compensation  utilizing the fair value recognition provisions prescribed by the authoritative guidance stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised the expected volatility of our stock and the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited in addition for performance stock units we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period if actual results differ significantly from our estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and related valuation allowance if any and liabilities requires significant judgment we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate the consolidated provision for income taxes may also change period to period based on nonrecurring events such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of reserves established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related interest which can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance 

  

can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit to the extent that the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event we change our determination as to the amount of deferred income tax assets that can be realized we will adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact recorded to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 

our indian subsidiaries collectively referred to as cognizant india are primarily exportoriented companies and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the indian government for export activities conducted within sezs for periods of up to 15 years we have constructed and expect to continue to locate most of our newer development facilities in sezs all indian profits including those generated within sezs are subject to the mat at the current rate of approximately 200 any mat paid is creditable against future corporate income tax within a 10year expiration period subject to limitations currently we anticipate utilizing our existing mat balances against our future corporate income tax obligations in india however our ability to do so could be impacted by possible changes to the indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of cognizant india 

derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that each derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date our derivative financial instruments consist of foreign exchange forward contracts we estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange forward contract by using a present value of expected cash flows model this model utilizes various assumptions including but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows discount rates and credit risk factors the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

investments  our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of time deposits mutual funds invested in fixed income securities and us dollar denominated corporate bonds municipal bonds certificates of deposit commercial paper debt issuances by the us government us government agencies foreign governments and supranational entities and assetbacked securities the assetbacked securities included government national mortgage association gnma mortgage backed securities and securities backed by auto loans credit card receivables and other receivables the years of issuance of our assetbacked securities fall in the 2004 to 2013 range 

we utilize various inputs to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio to the extent they exist unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets level 1 or quoted prices on similar assets level 2 are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in the absence of quoted prices or liquid markets valuation techniques would be used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable level 3 valuation techniques are based on various assumptions including but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows discount rates rate of return and adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity a significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using level 3 inputs the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our security valuation methodologies 

we periodically evaluate if unrealized losses as determined based on the security valuation methodologies discussed above on individual securities classified as availableforsale in the investment portfolio are considered to be otherthantemporary the analysis of otherthantemporary impairment requires the use of 

  

various assumptions including but not limited to the length of time an investment’s book value is greater than fair value the severity of the investment’s decline any credit deterioration of the investment whether management intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is generally recorded to income and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative creditworthiness of each customer historical collections experience and other information including the aging of the receivables if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant when determining the fair value of our reporting units we utilize various assumptions including projections of future cash flows any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge based upon our most recent evaluation of goodwill there are no significant risks of impairment for any of our reporting units as of december 31 2013 our goodwill balance was 4442 million 

longlived assets and intangibles  we review longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in general we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset if such assets were determined to be impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks  the majority of our development and delivery centers including a majority of our employees are located in india as a result we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights limitations on immigration programs the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potential geopolitical and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts and potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers we are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the inability of our management to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline see part i item 1a “risk factors”

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures

 business strategies 

our objectives are to maximize stockholder value and enhance our position as a leading provider of information technology consulting and business process outsourcing services we implement the following core strategies to achieve these objectives 

growth through reinvestment  historically we have invested our profit above the 19 to 20 nongaap operating margin level excluding stockbased compensation expense back into our business we believe this to be a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth this investment is primarily focused in the areas of strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise training our technical staff in a broader range of service offerings recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees and maintaining a level of resources trained in a broad range of service offerings to be well positioned to respond to our client requests as described below 

 

   

 we believe that the continued expansion of our service offerings will provide new sources of revenue reduce our reliance on any one technology initiative and help foster longterm relationships with our customers by allowing us to better serve their needs additionally as part of our vision to continue our growth and anticipate our clients’ and the markets’ rapidly changing demands in the nearterm midterm and longterm we are investing in emerging opportunities which seek to transform client and user platforms to internet cloud and mobilebased experiences 

 

  

  

 we have invested considerably in automation to improve process institutionalization across the organization for example we have built and deployed “cognizant 20” an intelligent delivery ecosystem which orchestrates processes methodologies and best practices driving effective usage of 

  

knowledge while providing a collaborative framework for our worldwide client service personnel our process framework has been extensively adapted to cater to different types of projects managed by the organization across different service lines such as application development managed services application testing bpo and it is 

global delivery model we have a fourtiered global architecture for service delivery and operations consisting of employees colocated at clients’ sites local or incountry delivery centers regional delivery centers and global delivery centers our extensive facilities technology and communications infrastructure facilitate the seamless integration of our global workforces this is accomplished by permitting team members in different locations to access common project information and to work directly on client projects this infrastructure allows for rapid completion of projects highest level of quality efficient use of clients’ technological resources and realtime access to project information by the onsite account manager or the client in addition for large projects with short time frames our offshore facilities allow for parallel processing of various development phases to accelerate delivery time 

 

  

  

   

further develop longterm client relationships  we have strong longterm strategic relationships with our clients and business partners we seek to establish longterm relationships that present recurring revenue opportunities frequently trying to establish relationships with our clients’ chief information officers or other it and business decision makers by offering a wide array of costeffective high quality services approximately 98 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 were derived from clients who had been using our services at the end of 2011 we also seek to leverage our experience with a client’s it systems into new business opportunities knowledge of a client’s processes and it systems gained during the performance of application maintenance services for example may provide us with a competitive advantage in securing additional maintenance development and other projects from that client 

pursue selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances  we believe that opportunities continue to exist in the fragmented market in which we operate to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances we believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence service offering and capabilities more rapidly for example in late 2012 we completed an acquisition of medicall inc an offshore provider of outsourced clinical services focused on the healthcare sector the services require clinical licensure and expertise as part of the transaction we acquired over 600 uslicensed nurses located primarily in the philippines this acquisition allows us to expand our bpo expertise within the healthcare industry finally we expect to continue to form strategic alliances with select it service firms that offer complementary services to best meet the requirements of our clients 

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our services directly through our professional staff senior management and direct sales personnel operating out of our teaneck new jersey headquarters and our business development offices which are strategically located in various metropolitan areas around the world the sales and marketing group works with our client delivery team as the sales process moves closer to the customer’s selection of a services provider the duration of the sales process varies depending on the type of service ranging from approximately two months to over one year

for the year ended december 31 2012 we derived our revenues from the following business segments 413 from financial services 263 from healthcare 204 from manufacturingretaillogistics and 120 from other

we have offices and operations in various countries around the world and provide services to clients globally in 2012 approximately 794 of our revenues were attributable to the north american region 163 were attributable to the european region and 43 were attributable to the rest of the world primarily the asia pacific region if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations including regulatory economic political and other uncertainties in india fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates international hostilities terrorism natural disasters and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india and we are subject to regulatory economic political and other uncertainties in india 

we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india where a majority of our technical professionals are located while wage costs are lower in india than in the united states and other developed countries for comparably skilled professionals wages in india have historically increased at a faster rate than in the united states and other countries in which we operate if this trend continues in the future it would result in increased costs for our skilled professionals and thereby potentially reduce our operating margins also there is no assurance that in future periods competition for skilled professionals will not drive salaries higher in india thereby resulting in increased costs for our technical professionals and reduced operating margins 

india has also recently experienced civil unrest and terrorism and has been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries in recent years there have been military confrontations between india and pakistan that have occurred in the region of kashmir and along the indiapakistan border the potential for hostilities between the two countries has been high in light of tensions related to recent terrorist incidents in india and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment including events in and related to afghanistan and iraq if india becomes engaged in armed hostilities particularly if these hostilities are protracted or involve the threat of or use of weapons of mass destruction it is likely that our operations would be materially adversely affected in addition companies may decline to contract with us for services in light of international terrorist incidents or armed hostilities even where india is not involved because of more generalized concerns about relying on a service provider utilizing international resources that may be viewed as less stable than those provided domestically 

in the past the indian economy has experienced many of the problems that commonly confront the economies of developing countries including high inflation erratic gross domestic product growth and shortages of foreign exchange the indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy and indian government actions concerning the economy could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities like us in the past the indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy including the software development services industry programs that have benefited us include among others tax holidays liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation notwithstanding these benefits as noted above india’s central and state governments remain significantly involved in the indian economy as regulators in recent years the indian government has introduced nonincome related taxes including new service taxes and incomerelated taxes 

  

including the minimum alternative tax or mat in addition a change in government leadership in india or a change in policies of the existing government in india that results in the elimination of any of the benefits realized by us from our indian operations or the imposition of new taxes applicable to such operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the emergence of a widespread health emergency or pandemic which may be more difficult to prevent or contain in a country like india as compared to more developed countries could create economic or financial disruption that could negatively affect our revenue and operations or impair our ability to manage our business in certain parts of the world 

our international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties 

revenues from customers outside north america represented approximately 206 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 we anticipate that revenues from customers outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence particularly in europe the asia pacific region and the latin america region in addition the majority of our employees along with our development and delivery centers are located in india as a result we may be subject to risks inherently associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may cause volatility in our reported income and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions from time to time we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate our risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations the use of hedging contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of our foreign operations but does not completely eliminate volatility and risk in addition use of hedging contracts includes the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property andor contractual rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in addition we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations additionally such companies may have longstanding or wellestablished relationships with local officials andor desired clients which may put us at a competitive disadvantage we may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture our international expansion plans may not be successful and we may not be able to compete effectively in other countries there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not impede the success of our international expansion plans limit our ability to compete effectively in other countries or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the indian rupee and other foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on the deployment of cash across our global operations 

although we report our operating results in us dollars a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues income from operations other income expense net and the value of balance sheet items originally denominated in other currencies there is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations or that any efforts by us to engage in currency hedging activities will be effective in addition in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which could limit our ability to use these funds across our global operations finally as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of 

  

our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee against the us dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency 

our operating results may be adversely affected by our use of derivative financial instruments 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain rupee denominated payments in india these contracts are intended to partially offset the impact of the movement of the exchange rates on future operating costs in addition we also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate foreign currency risk on indian rupee denominated net monetary assets the hedging strategies that we have implemented or may in the future implement to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market operational and counterparty credit risks accordingly we may incur losses from our use of derivative financial instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violations of these regulations could harm our business 

because we provide services to clients throughout the world we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal rules on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations violations of these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business damage to our reputation and other unintended consequences such as liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

among other anticorruption laws and regulations including the uk bribery act we are subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which prohibits improper payments or offers of improper payments to foreign officials to obtain business or any other benefit the fcpa also requires covered companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate these anticorruption laws or regulations although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance our employees subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these policies or procedures or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations furthermore the us government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability fcpa violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions including fines and suspension or disqualification from government contracting or contracting with private entities in certain highly regulated industries any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

international hostilities terrorist activities other violence or war natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could delay or reduce the number of new service orders we receive and impair our ability to service our customers thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

hostilities involving the united states and acts of terrorism violence or war such as the attacks of september 11 2001 in the united states the attacks of july 7 2005 in the united kingdom the attacks of 

  

november 26 2008 and july 13 2011 in mumbai india and the continuing conflict in the middle east and afghanistan natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat or perceived potential for these events could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to provide services to our customers such events may cause customers to delay their decisions on spending for information technology consulting and business and knowledge process outsourcing services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our clients which could affect our financial results by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to some or all of our clients as noted above the majority of our technical professionals are located in india and the vast majority of our technical professionals in the united states and europe are indian nationals who are able to work in the united states and europe only because they hold current visas and work permits travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

although we continue to believe that we have a strong competitive position in the united states we continue to increase our efforts to geographically diversify our clients and revenue despite our efforts to diversify hostilities involving the united states the united kingdom india and other countries in which we provide services to our clients and other acts of terrorism violence or war natural disasters global health risks or pandemics may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability while we plan and prepare to defend against each of these occurrences we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our operating results could be adversely affected 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted and negative perceptions associated with offshore outsourcing could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our customers 

the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest market for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by united states companies are periodically considered in the us congress and in numerous state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs domestically on august 13 2010 president barack obama signed legislation which imposed additional fees of 2000 for certain h1b petitions and 2250 for certain l1a and l1b petitions beginning in august 2010 through september 20 2014 these fees were later extended through september 20 2015 given the ongoing debate over outsourcing the introduction and consideration of other restrictive legislation or regulations is possible if enacted such measures may broaden existing restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly or impact private industry with measures that include but are not limited to tax disincentives fees or penalties intellectual property transfer restrictions mandatory government audit requirements and new standards that have the effect of restricting the use of certain business andor work visas in the event that any of these measures become law our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to provide services to our customers could be impaired 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as domestic job loss and theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data particularly involving service providers in india current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from utilizing global service delivery providers due to negative perceptions that may be associated with using global service delivery models or firms any slowdown or reversal of existing 

  

industry trends toward global service delivery would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide the majority of their services from within the country in which our clients operate 

existing and future legislative and administrative regulatory policies restricting the performance of business process services from an offshore location in jurisdictions in europe the asia pacific or any other region in which we have clients could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example legislation enacted in the united kingdom based on the 1977 ec acquired rights directive has been adopted in some form by many european union or eu countries and provides that if a company outsources all or part of its business to a service provider or changes its current service provider the affected employees of the company or of the previous service provider are entitled to become employees of the new service provider generally on the same terms and conditions as their original employment in addition dismissals of employees who were employed by the company or the previous service provider immediately prior to that transfer are automatically considered unfair dismissals that entitle such employees to compensation as a result to avoid unfair dismissal claims we may have to offer and become liable for voluntary redundancy payments to the employees of our clients who outsource business to us in the united kingdom and other eu countries that have adopted similar laws these types of policies may materially affect our ability to obtain new business from companies in the united kingdom and eu and to provide outsourced services to companies in the united kingdom and eu in a costeffective manner 

our growth may be hindered by immigration restrictions 

our future success continues to depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills including those from developing countries especially india the ability of foreign nationals to work in the united states and europe depends on their ability and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits 

the h1b visa classification enables united states employers to hire certain qualified foreign workers in positions that require an education at least equal to a fouryear bachelor degree in the united states in specialty occupations such as it systems engineering and computer systems analysis the h1b visa usually permits an individual to work and live in the united states for a period of up to six years under certain limited circumstances h1b visa extensions after the sixyear period may be available there is a limit on the number of new h1b petitions that the united states citizenship and immigration services or cis may approve in any federal fiscal year and in years in which this limit is reached we may be unable to obtain h1b visas necessary to bring foreign employees to the united states currently the limit is 65000 for holders of united states or united statesequivalent bachelor degrees the general cap and an additional 20000 for holders of advanced degrees from united states postsecondary educational institutions cis announced on june 11 2012 that the agency had reached its general cap of 65000 h1b visas and on june 7 2012 that the agency had reached its advanced degree cap of 20000 h1b visas for the fiscal year fy 2013 we will begin filing h1b petitions with cis against the fiscal year fy 2014 caps beginning april 1 2013 for work in h1b status beginning on october 1 2013 as part of our advanced planning process we believe that we have a sufficient number of employees who are work permitready to meet our anticipated business growth in the current year in addition there are strict labor regulations associated with the h1b visa classification larger users of the h1b visa program like us face additionalhigher legal and regulatory standards and are often subject to investigations by the wage and hour division of the united states department of labor dol and unannounced random site inspections by cis’s parent agency the united states department of homeland security dhs a finding by dol dhs and or another governmental agency of willful or substantial failure to comply with existing regulations on the h1b classification may result in backpay liability substantial fines and or a ban on future use of the h1b program and or other immigration benefits 

we also regularly transfer foreign professionals to the united states to work including work on projects at client sites using the l1 visa classification companies abroad are allowed to transfer certain managers and 

  

executives through the l1a visa and employees with specialized company knowledge through the l1b visa to related united states companies such as a parent subsidiary affiliate joint venture or branch office we have an approved “blanket l” petition under which the corporate relationships of our transferring and receiving entities have been preapproved by cis thus enabling individual l1 visa applications to be presented directly to a visaissuing united states consular post abroad rather than undergoing a preapproval process through cis in the united states in recent years both the united states consular posts in india that review initial l1 applications and cis which adjudicates individual petitions for initial grants and extensions of l1 visa status have become increasingly restrictive with respect to this category particularly the l1b “specialized knowledge” standard as a result the rate of refusals of initial individual l1 petitions and extensions for indian nationals has increased in addition even where l1 visas are ultimately granted and issued security measures undertaken by united states consular posts around the world have delayed or prevented visa issuances our inability to bring qualified technical personnel into the united states to staff onsite customer locations would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

pursuant to the l1 visa reform act we must meet a number of restrictions and requirements to obtain l1 visas for our personnel for example all l1 applicants including those brought to the united states under a blanket l program must have worked abroad with the related company for one full year in the prior three years in addition l1b “specialized knowledge” visa holders may not be primarily stationed at the work site of another employer if the l1b visa holder will be principally controlled and supervised by an employer other than the petitioning employer finally l1b status may not be granted where placement of the l1b visa holder at a third party site is part of an arrangement to provide labor for the third party rather than placement at the site in connection with the provision of a product or service involving specialized knowledge specific to the petitioning employer 

we do not place l1b workers at third party sites where they are under the primary supervision of a different employer nor do we place l1b workers at third party sites in an arrangement to provide labor for the third party without providing a service involving our workers’ specialized knowledge since implementation of the l1 visa reform act we consistently have established this fact to cis’s satisfaction however if cis and or the united states department of state through its visaissuing consular posts abroad decide to interpret these provisions in a very restrictive fashion this could impair our ability to effectively staff our projects in the united states with personnel from abroad new guidance governing these and related statutory provisions from cis is anticipated and if such guidance is restrictive in nature our ability to staff our projects in the united states with personnel from abroad will be impaired 

we also process immigrant visas for lawful permanent residence green cards in the united states for employees to fill positions for which there are an insufficient number of able willing and qualified united states workers available to fill the positions compliance with existing united states immigration and labor laws changes in those laws and or increase in governmental scrutiny making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting our ability to successfully obtain permanent residence for our foreign employees in the united states could require us to incur additional unexpected labor and or other costs and expenses and or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the united states any of these restrictions or limitations on our hiring practices could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to immigration restrictions in the united states there are certain restrictions on transferring employees to work in the united kingdom where we have experienced significant growth the united kingdom currently requires that all employees who are not nationals of european union countries plus nationals of bulgaria and romania or eea nationals obtain work permission before obtaining a visaentry clearance to travel to the united kingdom european nations such as hungary poland lithuania slovakia and the czech republic do not have a work permit requirement but employees need to register to work within 30 days of arrival the united kingdom has a pointsbased system under which certain certificates of sponsorship are issued by licensed employer sponsors provided the employees they seek to employ in the united kingdom can 

  

accumulate a certain number of points based on certain attributes where the employee has not worked for a cognizant group company outside the united kingdom for at least 6 months we must carry out a resident labor market test to confirm that the intended role cannot be filled by an eea national we are currently an arated sponsor and were allocated certificates of sponsorship which we believe are sufficient to meet our current and expected demand for transfers to the united kingdom on november 23 2010 the united kingdom announced new restrictions to control annual net migration but allowed for temporary intracompany transfers of employees from outside the european economic area for up to five years as long as the employees meet certain compensation requirements 

immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the united states the united kingdom the eu switzerland and other countries are subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement immigration and work permit laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity our international expansion strategy and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed 

our revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in the united states and europe as well as on clients concentrated in certain industries including the financial services industry continuing or worsening economic conditions or factors that negatively affect the economic health of the united states europe or these industries may adversely affect our business 

approximately 794 of our revenues during the year ended december 31 2012 were derived from customers located in north america in the same period approximately 163 of our revenues were derived from customers located in europe if the united states or european economy continues to weaken or slow and conditions in the financial markets continue to deteriorate pricing for our services may be depressed and our customers may reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability additionally any prolonged recession in the united states and europe could have an adverse impact on our revenues because our revenues are primarily derived from the united states and europe in addition during the year ended december 31 2012 we earned approximately 413 of our revenues from the financial services industry which includes insurance deterioration in the financial services industry or significant consolidation in that industry or a decrease in growth or consolidation in other industry segments on which we focus may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability in addition if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions affecting the industries and markets in which we operate we may be unable to effectively plan for or respond to those changes and our business could be negatively affected 

we face intense competition from other service providers 

we operate in intensely competitive industries that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards and changes in customer requirements the intensely competitive information technology consulting and business process outsourcing professional services markets include a large number of participants and are subject to rapid change these markets include participants from a variety of market segments including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

 these markets also include numerous smaller local competitors in the various geographic markets in which we operate which may be able to provide services and solutions at lower costs or on terms more attractive to clients than we can our direct competitors include among others accenture capgemini computer sciences corporation genpact hcl technologies hp enterprise formerly electronic data systems ibm global services infosys technologies tata consultancy services and wipro many of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals there is a risk that increased competition could put downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services and on our operating margins similarly if our competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices without adversely affecting their profit margins even if our offerings address industry and client needs our competitors may be more successful at selling their services if we are unable to provide our clients with superior services and solutions at competitive prices or successfully market those services to current and prospective clients our results of operations may suffer further a client may choose to use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm to perform the types of services we provide we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain our current levels of profitability or growth in the face of competitive pressures including competition for skilled technology professionals and pricing pressure from competitors employing an onsiteoffshore business model 

in addition we may face competition from companies that increase in size or scope as the result of strategic mergers or acquisitions these transactions may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers software companies and vendors and service providers the result of any such vertical integration may be greater integration of products and services that were once offered separately by independent vendors our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of such an industry trend which could adversely affect our competitive position these types of events could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results such as reducing our revenue increasing our costs lowering our gross margin percentage and requiring us to recognize impairments on our assets 

we may not be able to sustain our current level of profitability 

for the year ended december 31 2012 we reported an operating margin of 185 our operating margin may decline if we experience declines in demand and pricing for our services an increase in our operating costs including imposition of new nonincome related taxes or due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition historically wages in india have increased at a faster rate than in the united states additionally the number and type of equitybased compensation awards and the assumptions used in valuing equitybased compensation awards may change resulting in increased stockbased compensation expense and lower margins although we have historically been able to partially offset wage increases and foreign currency fluctuations through further leveraging the scale of our operating structure obtaining price increases and issuing a lower number of stockbased compensation awards in proportion to our overall headcount we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to control our costs or improve our efficiency 

our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency affects our profitability if we are unable to control our costs or improve our efficiency our profitability could be negatively affected 

our business will suffer if we fail to develop new services and enhance our existing services in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological environment 

the information technology consulting and business process outsourcing professional services markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changing customer preferences and 

  

new product and service introductions our future success will depend on our ability to develop solutions that keep pace with changes in the markets in which we provide services we cannot be sure that we will be successful in developing new services addressing evolving technologies in a timely or costeffective manner or if these services are developed that we will be successful in the marketplace in addition we cannot be sure that products services or technologies developed by others will not render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to address the demands of the rapidly evolving technological environment could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to remain competitive will also depend on our ability to design and implement in a timely and costeffective manner solutions for customers that both leverage their legacy systems and appropriately utilize newer technologies such as cloudbased services web 20 models and softwareasaservice our failure to design and implement solutions in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may face difficulties in providing endtoend business solutions or delivering complex and large projects for our clients that could cause clients to discontinue their work with us which in turn could harm our business 

we have been expanding the nature and scope of our engagements and have added new service offerings such as it consulting business and knowledge process outsourcing systems integration and outsourcing of entire portions of it infrastructure the success of these service offerings is dependent in part upon continued demand for such services by our existing new and prospective clients and our ability to meet this demand in a costcompetitive and effective manner in addition our ability to effectively offer a wider breadth of endtoend business solutions depends on our ability to attract existing or new clients to these service offerings to obtain engagements for such endtoend solutions we also are more likely to compete with large wellestablished international consulting firms resulting in increased competition and marketing costs accordingly we cannot be certain that our new service offerings will effectively meet client needs or that we will be able to attract existing and new clients to these service offerings 

the increased breadth of our service offerings may result in larger and more complex projects with our clients this will require us to establish closer relationships with our clients and a thorough understanding of their operations our ability to establish such relationships will depend on a number of factors including the proficiency of our professionals and our management personnel our failure to understand our client requirements or our failure to deliver services that meet the requirements specified by our clients could result in termination of client contracts and we could be liable to our clients for significant penalties or damages 

larger projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements these terminations cancellations or delays may result from factors that have little or nothing to do with the quality of our services such as the business or financial condition of our clients or the economy generally such cancellations or delays make it difficult to plan for project resource requirements and inaccuracies in such resource planning and allocation may have a negative impact on our profitability 

if our clients are not satisfied with our services our business could be adversely affected 

our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing clients our business model also depends on our account teams’ ability to develop relationships with our clients that enable us to understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to those needs if a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client in particular clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their 

  

scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors in addition negative publicity related to our client services or relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients 

we rely on a few customers for a large portion of our revenues 

our top five and top ten customers generated approximately 140 and 250 respectively of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a major customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year the loss of one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we generally do not have longterm contracts with our customers and our results of operations could be adversely affected if our clients terminate their contracts with us on short notice 

consistent with industry practice we generally do not enter into longterm contracts with our customers a majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice and without significant early termination cost terminations may result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project including the business or financial conditions of the client changes in ownership or management at our clients changes in client strategies or the economy or markets generally when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to eliminate our associated costs in a timely manner consequently our profit margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected if we are unable to replace the lost revenue with other work on terms we find acceptable or effectively eliminate costs we may not be able to maintain our level of profitability 

our results of operations may be affected by the rate of growth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of technology spending by our clients 

our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients as well as their customers and suppliers in challenging economic environments our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities at the same time many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel processes and infrastructures if the growth of technology usage in business or our clients’ spending on technology in business declines or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new technological solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our clients our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions such as the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system could also result in financial difficulties including limited access to the credit markets insolvency or bankruptcy for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of 

  

operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

we are investing substantial cash in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately 

we have made and continue to make significant contractual commitments related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our development and delivery centers we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability may be reduced 

competition for highlyskilled technical personnel is intense and the success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled professionals 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highlyskilled professionals so as to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in particular we must attract train and retain appropriate numbers of talented people including project managers it engineers and other senior technical personnel with diverse skills in order to serve client needs and grow our business we are particularly dependent on retaining our senior executives and other experienced managers with the skill sets required by our business and if we are unable to do so our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized similarly the profitability of our business model depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to support our projects the processes and costs associated with recruiting training and retaining employees place significant demands on our resources 

we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for professionals with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer we have subcontracted to a limited extent in the past and may do so in the future with other service providers in order to meet our obligations to our customers our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend in large part on our ability to attract train and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences further we must train and manage our growing work force requiring an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel we cannot guarantee that the management skills and systems currently in place will be adequate or that we will be able to train and assimilate new employees successfully our profits and ability to compete for and manage client engagements could be adversely affected if we cannot manage employee hiring and attrition to achieve a stable and efficient workforce structure 

our ability to operate and compete effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel or if we cannot attract additional qualified personnel 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of the key members of our management team as well as marketing sales and technical personnel and our ability to attract and retain new management and other personnel we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or significant employees competition for personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting and retaining new personnel in the future the loss of any one or more of our key personnel or the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

restrictions in noncompetition agreements with our executive officers may not be enforceable 

currently we have entered into noncompetition agreements with the majority of our executive officers we cannot be certain however that the restrictions in these agreements prohibiting such executive officers from 

  

engaging in competitive activities are enforceable further substantially all of our professional nonexecutive staff are not covered by agreements that would prohibit them from working for our competitors if any of our key professional personnel leaves our employment and joins one of our competitors our business could be adversely affected 

our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate foreign earnings or if such earnings become subject to us tax on a current basis 

effective january 1 2002 and in accordance with authoritative literature we no longer accrue incremental us taxes on our indian earnings recognized after 2001 as these earnings as well as other foreign earnings for all periods are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur that could effectively force us to change our intent not to repatriate such earnings if we change our intent and repatriate such earnings we will have to accrue taxes associated with such earnings at a substantially higher rate than our effective income tax rate in 2012 these increased taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our earnings may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided by india to companies in our industry as well as by proposed tax legislation in india 

our indian subsidiaries collectively referred to as cognizant india are primarily exportoriented and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the indian government for export activities conducted within special economic zones or sezs for periods of up to 15 years changes in indian tax laws that would reduce or deny sez tax benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition all indian profits including those generated within sezs are subject to the mat at the current rate of approximately 200 any mat paid is creditable against future corporate income tax subject to limitations currently we anticipate utilizing our existing mat balances against future corporate income tax our ability to fully do so may be influenced by possible changes to the indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of cognizant india our inability to fully utilize our deferred income tax assets related to the mat could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our earnings and financial condition may be negatively impacted by certain tax related matters 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions the provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods in addition our income tax returns are subject to examination in the jurisdictions in which we operate we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these examinations may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions we predominantly contract to provide services either on a timeandmaterials basis or on a fixedprice basis our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail 

  

the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations and utilizing workforces with different skill sets and competencies across geographically diverse service locations our pricing cost and profit margin estimates for the work that we perform frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract there is a risk that we will underprice our projects fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our profit margin 

in addition a significant portion of our projects are on a fixedprice basis subjecting us to the foregoing risks to an even greater extent fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 331 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 we expect that an increasing number of our future projects will be contracted on a fixedprice basis in addition to the other risks described in the paragraph above we bear the risk of cost overruns and operating cost inflation in connection with projects covered by fixedprice contracts our failure to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a fixedprice project or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within the time frame committed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing rates 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to recover for our services if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our profit margin and our profitability could suffer the rates we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable utilization rates 

the cost of providing our services including the utilization rate of our professionals affects our profitability if we are not able to maintain an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals our profit margin and our profitability may suffer our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

   

  

 if we do not continue to improve our operational financial and other internal controls and systems to manage our rapid growth and size or if we are unable to enter operate and compete effectively in new geographic markets our business may suffer and the value of our stockholders’ investment in our company may be harmed 

our anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources our growth will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls in the united states europe india and elsewhere in particular our continued growth will increase the challenges involved in 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the increasing size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that a member of our personnel will engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity breach our contractual obligations or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train our people and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired 

as part of our growth strategy we plan to continue expanding our operations in europe asia the middle east and latin america we may not be able to compete effectively in these markets and the cost of entering these markets may be substantially greater than we expect if we fail to compete effectively in the new markets we enter or if the cost of entering those markets is substantially greater than we expect our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we cannot compete effectively we may be required to reconsider our strategy to invest in our international expansion plans and change our intent on the repatriation of our earnings 

our operating results may experience significant quarterly fluctuations 

historically we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations and expect these fluctuations to continue among the factors causing these variations have been 

 

  

  

  

 in addition our future revenues operating margins and profitability may fluctuate as a result of 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a high percentage of our operating expenses particularly personnel and rent are relatively fixed in advance of any particular period as a result unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects or in employee wage levels and utilization rates may cause significant variations in our operating results in any particular period and could result in losses any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations any material reduction in utilization rates for our professional staff or variance in the onsiteoffshore staffing mix an unanticipated termination of a major project a customer’s decision not to pursue a new project or proceed to succeeding stages of a current project or the completion of several major customer projects during a quarter could require us to pay underutilized employees and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as a result of these factors it is possible that in some future periods our revenues and operating results may be significantly below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such an event the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 

we could be held liable for damages or our reputation could be damaged by disclosure of confidential information or personal data security breaches or system failures 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and securely store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or data including personal data in addition many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify the theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our or our clients’ confidential information or other proprietary business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce marketplace acceptance of our services any failure in the networks or computer systems used by us or our customers could result in a claim for substantial damages against us and significant reputational harm regardless of our responsibility for the failure although we attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our services we cannot assure you that any such damages are subject to a contractual limitation or that any such contractual limitations on liability will be enforceable or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages 

in addition we often have access to or are required to manage utilize collect and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data including nonpublic personal data as a result we are subject to numerous us and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches controls or procedures with which we are responsible for complying with respect to 

  

such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data or if unauthorized access to or disclosure of data in our possession or control occurs we could be subject to significant liability to our clients or our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or privacy laws as well as liability and penalties in connection with any violation of applicable privacy laws andor criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through breach of computer systems systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation or otherwise could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems and networks or those we develop or manage for our clients whether by our employees or third parties could result in negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation 

although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be sufficient in amount to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability including with respect to our contractual obligations in connection with providing our solutions and services 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our clients we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important economic opportunity by doing so or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines in addition the contracting practices of our competitors may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become standard in the marketplace if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope andor amount of our potential liability if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide solutions and services and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the enforceable terms of our agreements we might face significant legal liability and our business could be adversely affected 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients or other parties with whom we conduct business with respect to certain matters these arrangements can include provisions whereby we agree to hold the indemnified party and certain of their affiliated entities harmless with respect to thirdparty claims related to such matters as our breach of certain representations or covenants or out of our intellectual property infringement our gross negligence or willful misconduct or certain other claims made against certain parties payments by us under any of these arrangements are generally conditioned on the client making a claim and providing us with full control over the defense and settlement of such claim it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically we have not made payments under these indemnification agreements so they have not had any impact on our operating results financial position or cash flows however if events arise requiring us to make payment for indemnification claims under our indemnification obligations in contracts we have entered such payments could have a material impact on our operating results financial position and cash flows 

we could incur liability or our reputation could be damaged if our provision of services and solutions to our clients contributes to our clients’ internal control deficiencies 

our clients may perform audits or require us to perform audits and provide audit reports with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such clients especially when we process data belonging to them our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified 

  

opinion with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit in a timely manner additionally we could incur liability if our controls and procedures or the controls and procedures we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures or impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other valuable intellectual property we presently hold no issued patents or registered copyrights however we have filed patent applications and we intend to file additional patent applications there is no guarantee that any patents will be granted in the united states or in any other country we may seek protection or that they will serve as a barrier from competition from other organizations additionally the protection afforded by international patent laws as well as the enforcement actions differ from country to country there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain adequate protection or enforcement of our intellectual property rights 

we also rely upon a combination of copyright and trade secret laws nondisclosure and related contractual arrangements and other security measures to protect our intellectual property rights existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions such as china might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights india is a member of the berne convention and has agreed to recognize protections on copyrights conferred under the laws of foreign countries including the laws of the united states we believe that laws rules regulations and treaties in effect in the united states india and other countries in which we operate are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property however there can be no assurance that these laws will not change in ways that may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components libraries and toolsets and other technology or data we use in the performance of our services among the countries in which we operate and provide services there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of any of our intellectual property or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight 

unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in development of technology products or services that compete with our products and services and unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products services or proprietary information if we are unable to protect our intellectual property our business may be adversely affected and our ability to compete may be impaired 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed or used in connection with a contract than we normally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create and intend to reuse across multiple client engagements which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

our ability to enforce our software license agreements service agreements and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries to the extent that we seek to enforce our rights we could be subject to claims that an intellectual property right is invalid otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are pursuing a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights may result in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights or assert other claims against us which could harm our business if we are not successful in defending such claims in litigation we may not be able to sell or license a particular service or solution due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations in addition governments may adopt regulations or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others or governments may require that products meet specified 

  

standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others third parties may assert against us or our customers claims alleging infringement of patent copyright trademark or other intellectual property rights to technologies or services that are important to our business infringement claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions in our contracts we generally agree to indemnify our clients for certain expenses or liabilities resulting from potential infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of our liability under these indemnities could be substantial any claims that our products services or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims may result in significant costs in defending and resolving such claims and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business in addition as a result of such intellectual property infringement claims we could be required or otherwise decide that it is appropriate to 

 

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets which would reduce the value of our assets and increase expenses in addition if we alter or discontinue our offering of affected items or services our revenue could be affected if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages 

we expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our competitors are able to obtain patents and other intellectual property rights for software products and methods technological solutions and processes we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the primary purpose of asserting such claims against other companies the risk of infringement claims against us may also increase as we continue to develop and license our intellectual property to our clients and other third parties any infringement claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others which could harm our business 

we could lose our ability or be unable to secure the right to utilize the intellectual property of others thirdparty suppliers of software hardware or other intellectual property assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired as a result of any such denial our operating results could be adversely affected 

  

we may not be able to successfully acquire target companies or integrate acquired companies or technologies into our company and we may become subject to certain liabilities assumed or incurred in connection with our acquisitions that could harm our operating results 

if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services we expect to continue pursuing strategic acquisition and joint venture opportunities designed to enhance our capabilities expand our capacity and geographic presence andor enter new technology areas we cannot predict or guarantee that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate any acquisition or joint venture we may need to divert andor dedicate management and other resources to complete the transactions once we have consummated an acquisition transaction or entered into a joint venture transaction we may not be able to integrate the acquired business or joint venture and personnel into our operations recognize anticipated efficiencies andor benefits realize our strategic objectives or achieve the desired financial and operating results in each case both generally and as a result of our unique organizational structure acquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key personnel and the potential assumption or incurrence of liabilities andor obligations 

although we conduct due diligence in connection with each of our acquisitions there may be liabilities that we fail to discover that we inadequately assess in our due diligence efforts or that are not properly disclosed to us in particular to the extent that any acquired business or any properties thereof i failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations ii failed to fulfill contractual obligations to customers or iii incurred material liabilities or obligations to customers that are not identified during the diligence process we as the successor owner may be financially responsible for these violations failures and liabilities and may suffer financial andor reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected in addition as part of an acquisition we may assume responsibilities and obligations of the acquired business pursuant to the terms and conditions of services agreements entered by the acquired entity that are not consistent with the terms and conditions that we typically accept and require although we attempt to structure acquisitions in such a manner as to minimize our exposure to among other things the factors and conditions contemplated by the foregoing two sentences including through indemnification protection we cannot predict or guarantee that our efforts will be effective or will protect us from liability the discovery of any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions for which we are unable to recover indemnification amounts could harm our operating results 

system failure or disruptions in communications could disrupt our business and result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

to deliver our services to our customers we must maintain a high speed network of satellite fiber optic and land lines and active voice and data communications twentyfour hours a day between our main operating offices in chennai our other development and delivery centers and the offices of our customers worldwide although we maintain redundancy facilities and satellite communications links any systems failure or a significant lapse in our ability to transmit voice and data through satellite and telephone communications could result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting systems integration and technology or outsourcing services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

  

our ability to attract and retain business may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors since many of our specific client engagements involve unique services and solutions our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our clients’ evaluation of whether to engage our services we believe the cognizant brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former clients competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators former and current employees and personnel as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about our company even if based on false rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business in particular damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the cognizant brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us adversely affecting our share price 

provisions in our charter bylaws and stockholders’ rights plan and provisions under delaware law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals 

provisions in our charter and bylaws each as amended our stockholders’ rights plan and delaware general corporate law or dgcl may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover proposals or delaying or preventing changes in our control or management including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices in addition these documents and provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests our board of directors has the authority without further action by the stockholders to fix the rights and preferences and issue shares of preferred stock our charter provides for a classified board of directors which will prevent a change of control of our board of directors at a single meeting of stockholders the prohibition of our stockholders’ ability to act by written consent and the restrictions imposed on our stockholders’ ability to call a special meeting may have the effect of delaying stockholder actions until annual meetings or until a special meeting is called by our chairman or chief executive officer or our board of directors the supermajorityvoting requirement for specified amendments to our charter and bylaws allows a minority of our stockholders to block those amendments the dgcl also contains provisions preventing stockholders from engaging in business combinations with us subject to certain exceptions these provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock 

new and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements add uncertainty to our compliance policies and increase our costs of compliance 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to accounting corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 other sec regulations and the nasdaq global select market rules are creating uncertainty for companies like ours these laws regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such corporate governance standards 

in particular our efforts to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors’ audit of that assessment requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources we consistently assess the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting remediate any control deficiencies that may be identified and validate through testing that our controls are functioning as documented while we do not anticipate any material weaknesses the inability of management and our independent auditor to 

  

provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy and effectiveness respectively of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure and our efforts to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities in addition the laws regulations and standards regarding corporate governance may make it more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with their performance of duties as a result we may face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which could harm our business if we fail to comply with new or changed laws regulations or standards of corporate governance our business and reputation may be harmed 

our share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our stockholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls to ensure the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis or be unable to properly report on our business and the results of our operations and the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected 

we are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio 

recent turmoil in the financial markets has adversely affected economic activity in the united states europe and other regions of the world in which we do business we believe that based on our current cash cash equivalents and investment balances and expected operating cash flows the current lack of liquidity in the credit markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity cash flow or financial flexibility continued deterioration of the credit and capital markets could result in volatility of our investment earnings and impairments to our investment portfolio which could negatively impact our financial condition and reported income the continued decline in economic activity could adversely affect the ability of counterparties to certain financial instruments such as marketable securities and derivatives to meet their obligations to us 

our stock price continues to be volatile 

our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive summary 

in 2012 our revenues increased to 73465 million compared to 61212 million in 2011 net income increased to 10513 million or 344 per diluted share including stockbased compensation expense net of tax equal to 026 per diluted share during 2012 this is compared to net income of 8836 million or 285 per diluted share including stockbased compensation expense net of tax equal to 022 per diluted share during 2011 the key drivers of our revenue growth in 2012 were as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we saw a continued demand from our customers for a broad range of it solutions including application maintenance complex systems development engagements testing erp infrastructure management bpo and business intelligence we finished the year with approximately 821 active clients compared to approximately 785 as of december 31 2011 and increased the number of strategic clients by 23 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 214 we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate at least 5 million to 50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity our top five and top ten customers accounted for 140 and 250 respectively of our total revenues in 2012 as compared to 163 and 277 respectively for the year ended december 31 2011 as we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to decline over time 

our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of and strong demand for offshore it software and services and business process outsourcing nasscom india’s national association of software and service companies reports indicate that export revenues from india’s it software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to meet the lowerend of its growth guidance and at least achieve a double digit growth for nasscom’s fiscal year 2013 according to nasscom’s “perspective 2020 transform business transform india” report global changes and new megatrends within economic demographic business social and environmental areas are set to expand the outsourcing industry by creating new dynamics and opportunities and are expected to result in export revenues of 175 billion by 2020 

our revenue from european customers increased by 89 to approximately 11955 million in 2012 compared to approximately 10975 million in 2011 revenue from europe excluding the uk increased by approximately 319 million from approximately 3986 million in 2011 to approximately 4306 million in 2012 and revenue from the uk increased by approximately 661 million from approximately 6989 million in 2011 to approximately 7649 million in 2012 we believe that europe the middle east and the asia pacific regions particularly japan india australia and singapore will continue to be areas of significant investment for us as we see these regions as growth opportunities for the long term 

in 2012 our operating margin decreased slightly to 185 compared to 186 in 2011 excluding stockbased compensation expense of approximately 1074 million operating margin in 2012 was 200 this was 

  

within our historic targeted operating margin range excluding stockbased compensation costs of 19 to 20 of total revenues the slight decrease in operating margin was primarily due to continued investments to grow our business partially offset by the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar net of the impact of our cash flow hedge losses and economies of scale driven by increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization historically we have invested our profitability above the 19 to 20 operating margin level which excludes stockbased compensation back into our business which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth this investment is primarily focused in the areas of hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise training our technical staff in a broader range of service offerings strengthening our business analytics capabilities strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery as well as recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees in addition this investment includes maintaining a level of resources trained in a broad range of service offerings to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects for the year ending december 31 2013 we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our targeted operating margin levels back into the business 

we finished the year with approximately 156700 employees which is an increase of approximately 19000 over the prior year the increase in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs to meet the demand for our services is the primary driver of the increase in our operating expenses in 2012 annualized turnover including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 107 for 2012 the majority of our turnover occurs in india as a result annualized attrition rates onsite at clients are below our global attrition rate in addition attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation costs in india which may continue in the future however historically this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs the mix of our professional staff as well as utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies 

our current india real estate development program includes planned construction of 105 million square feet of new space between 2011 and the end of 2015 this program includes the expenditure of over 7000 million during this period on land acquisition facilities construction and furnishings to build new companyowned stateoftheart development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as special economic zones or sezs located in india during 2013 we expect to spend approximately 400 million globally for capital expenditures including the indian real estate development program 

at december 31 2012 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 28638 million and working capital of 34370 million accordingly we do not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues during 2012 we repurchased approximately 4860 million of our class a common stock under our existing stock repurchase program stock repurchases were funded from working capital 

during 2013 barring any unforeseen events we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results 

 

  

  

  

  

   

in response to this macroeconomic environment we plan to

  the following table includes nongaap income from operations excluding stockbased compensation a measure defined by the securities and exchange commission as a nongaap financial measure this nongaap financial measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies in addition this nongaap measure should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap the reconciliations of cognizant’s gaap financial measures to the corresponding nongaap measures should be carefully evaluated 

  

we seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin excluding stockbased compensation expense of 19 to 20 of revenues accordingly we believe that nongaap income from operations excluding stockbased compensation expense is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance we believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the company provides enhanced transparency into the operating results of the company for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes we use financial statements that do not include stockbased compensation expense for financial and operational decision making to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors moreover because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use to account for stockbased compensation expense we believe that providing a nongaap financial measure that excludes stockbased compensation expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies accordingly we believe that the presentation of nongaap income from operations when read in conjunction with our reported gaap income from operations can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 

a limitation of using nongaap income from operations versus income from operations reported in accordance with gaap is that nongaap income from operations excludes stockbased compensation expense which is recurring stockbased compensation expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business in addition other companies may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than us thereby limiting the usefulness of this nongaap financial measure as a comparative tool we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from nongaap income from operations to allow investors to evaluate such nongaap financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap 

a reconciliation of income from operations as reported and nongaap income from operations excluding stockbased compensation expense is as follows for the years ended december 31

results by business segment 

our reportable segments are financial services which includes customers providing bankingtransaction processing capital markets and insurance services healthcare which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers manufacturingretaillogistics which includes manufacturers retailers travel and other hospitality customers as well as customers providing logistics services and other which is an aggregation of industry operating segments each of which individually represents less than 100 of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit the other segment includes information media and entertainment services communications and high technology operating segments our sales managers account executives account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve 

our chief operating decision maker evaluates cognizant’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development and delivery centers certain selling general and administrative expenses excess or shortfall of incentive compensation for delivery personnel as compared to target stockbased compensation expense a portion of depreciation and amortization and the impact of the settlements of our cash flow hedges are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker accordingly such expenses are excluded from segment operating profit 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 821 active clients accordingly we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment however no individual customer exceeded 100 of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 or 2010 in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and we believe that a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues

net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 11726 million for the year ended december 31 2012 8752 million for the year ended december 31 2011 and 7647 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in 2012 was primarily attributed to the increase in net income and more efficient deployment of working capital during 2012 as compared to 2011 the increase in 2011 as compared to 2010 is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income trade accounts receivable increased to 13457 million at december 31 2012 as compared to approximately 11790 million at december 31 2011 and approximately 9013 million at december 31 2010 unbilled accounts receivable increased to approximately 1831 million at december 31 2012 as compared to 1396 at december 31 2011 and approximately 1130 million at december 31 2010 the increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2012 was due primarily to increased revenues we monitor turnover aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff at december 31 2012 our days sales outstanding including unbilled receivables was approximately 72 days as compared to 73 days as of december 31 2011 and 71 days as of december 31 2010 

our investing activities used net cash of approximately 5701 million for the year ended december 31 2012 8503 million for the year ended december 31 2011 and 4469 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2012 is related to a decrease in net purchases of investments lower payments for acquisitions partially offset higher spending for capital expenditures during the year the increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2011 as compared to 2010 related to an increase in net purchases of investments an increase in spending for capital expenditures during the year and higher payments for acquisitions 

  

our financing activities used net cash of approximately 3430 million for the year ended december 31 2012 and 2555 million for the year ended december 31 2011 and provided net cash of approximately 1200 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in net cash used in financing activities in both years is primarily related to higher levels of repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program 

as of december 31 2012 20545 million of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries we utilize a variety of strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to income taxes in the united states less applicable foreign tax credits however other than amounts representing pre2002 undistributed indian earnings for which we have already accrued us taxes we intend to permanently reinvest these funds outside the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these amounts to fund our us operations if such earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings at that time due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation 

our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our longterm capital requirements beyond a twelve month period will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock our continued intent not to repatriate foreign earnings and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we cannot be certain that additional financing if required will be available on terms favorable to us if at all we expect our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months 

commitments and contingencies 

as of december 31 2012 we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately 1635 million related to our india development center expansion program which included expenditures for land acquisition facilities construction and furnishings to build new stateoftheart development and delivery centers primarily in regions designated as sezs located in india as of december 31 2012 we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

  

  as of december 31 2012 we had 927 million of unrecognized tax benefits this represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been 

  

recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution the resolution or settlement of these income tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management the outcome of such claims and legal actions if decided adversely is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results cash flows or consolidated financial position additionally many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our clients including any breach involving a customer’s confidential information or sensitive data or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our services there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results financial position and cash flows 

foreign currency risk 

overall we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as approximately 794 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 were generated from customers located in north america however a portion of our costs in india representing approximately 305 of our global operating costs for the year ended december 31 2012 are denominated in the indian rupee and are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations in addition a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may result in nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement in 2012 we reported foreign currency exchange losses exclusive of hedging gains or losses of approximately 117 million which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of indian rupee net monetary assets on cognizant india’s books to the us dollar functional currency on an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to certain currencies in our foreign subsidiaries primarily the indian rupee 

we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses these hedges to buy indian rupees and sell us dollars are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs we recorded losses of 961 million in 2012 and gains of 188 million in 2011 on contracts that settled during each year as of december 31 2012 we have outstanding contracts with a total notional value of 33530 million at a weighted average forward rate of 5413 rupees to the us dollar these contracts are scheduled to mature as follows outstanding contracts with a notional value of 12530 million and a weighted average forward rate of 510 rupees to the us dollar scheduled to mature in 2013 outstanding contracts with a notional value of 1200 million and a weighted average forward rate of 541 rupees to the us dollar scheduled to mature in 2014 outstanding contracts with a notional value of 7800 million and a weighted average forward rate of 575 rupees to the us dollar scheduled to mature in 2015 and outstanding contracts with a notional value of 1200 million and a weighted average forward rate of 652 rupees to the us dollar scheduled to mature in 2016 

  

our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk for transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary these contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2013 which are primarily used to hedge our indian rupee denominated net monetary assets at december 31 2012 the notional value of the outstanding contracts was 2086 million and the related fair value was a net liability of 52 million during 2012 inclusive of losses of 83 million on these undesignated balance sheet hedges we reported net foreign currency exchange losses of approximately 200 million 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than our foreign exchange forward contracts there were no offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2012 2011 and 2010 that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company’s financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

effects of inflation 

our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals competition in india the united states and europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation as with other service providers in our industry we must adequately anticipate wage increases particularly on our fixedprice contracts historically we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation in india however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future 

critical accounting estimates and risks 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixedbid contracts the allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets valuation of investments and derivative financial instruments assumptions used in valuing stockbased compensation arrangements contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts which are predominantly fixedprice contracts are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting under this method total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost cost to cost method this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations contract losses for the periods presented were immaterial 

stockbased compensation  utilizing the fair value recognition provisions prescribed by the authoritative guidance stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised the expected volatility of our stock and the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited in addition for performance stock units we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period if actual results differ significantly from our estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and related valuation allowance if any and liabilities requires significant judgment we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate the consolidated provision for income taxes may also change period to period based on nonrecurring events such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related net interest which can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event we change our determination as to the amount of deferred income tax assets that can be realized we will adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact recorded to income tax expense in the period in which such determination was made 

our indian subsidiaries collectively referred to as cognizant india are primarily exportoriented companies and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the indian government for export activities conducted within special economic zones or sezs for periods of up to 15 years we have constructed and 

  

expect to continue to locate most of our newer development facilities in sezs all indian profits including those generated within sezs are subject to the minimum alternative tax or mat at the current rate of approximately 200 any mat paid is creditable against future corporate income tax within a 10year expiration period subject to certain limitations currently we anticipate utilizing our existing mat balances against our future corporate income tax obligations in india however our ability to do so could be impacted by possible changes to the indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of cognizant india 

derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that each derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date our derivative financial instruments consist of foreign exchange forward contracts we estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange forward contract by using a present value of expected cash flows model this model utilizes various assumptions including but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows discount rates and credit risk factors the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

investments  our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of time deposits mutual funds invested in fixed income securities and us dollar denominated corporate bonds municipal bonds certificates of deposit commercial paper debt issuances by the us government us government agencies foreign governments and supranational entities and assetbacked securities the assetbacked securities include securities backed by auto loans credit card receivables mortgage loans and other receivables and are rated aaaaaa the years of issuance of our assetbacked securities fall in the 2003 to 2012 range 

we utilize various inputs to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio to the extent they exist unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets level 1 or quoted prices on similar assets level 2 are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in the absence of quoted prices or liquid markets valuation techniques would be used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable level 3 valuation techniques are based on various assumptions including but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows discount rates rate of return and adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity a significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using level 3 inputs the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our security valuation methodologies 

we periodically evaluate if unrealized losses as determined based on the security valuation methodologies discussed above on individual securities classified as availableforsale in the investment portfolio are considered to be otherthantemporary the analysis of otherthantemporary impairment requires the use of various assumptions including but not limited to the length of time an investment’s book value is greater than fair value the severity of the investment’s decline any credit deterioration of the investment whether management intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is generally recorded to income and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative creditworthiness of each customer historical collections experience and other information including the aging of the receivables if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant when determining the fair value of our reporting units we utilize various assumptions including projections of future cash flows any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse 

  

change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge based upon our most recent evaluation of goodwill there are no significant risks of impairment for any of our reporting units as of december 31 2012 our goodwill balance was 3092 million 

longlived assets and intangibles  we review longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in general we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset if such assets were determined to be impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks  the majority of our development and delivery centers including a majority of our employees are located in india as a result we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights limitations on immigration programs the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potential geopolitical and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts and potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers we are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the inability of our management to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline see part i item 1a “risk factors” 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued guidance related to accumulated other comprehensive income requiring the presentation of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to the respective line items in the statement of operations for those amounts required by us gaap to be reclassified to earnings in their entirety in the same reporting period this presentation is required either on the statement of operations or in a single footnote for items that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to earnings the presentation requirement can be met by crossreferencing disclosures elsewhere in the footnotes the pronouncement is effective on a prospective basis effective for interim and annual reporting periods that start after december 15 2012 the adoption of this standard affects financial statement presentation only and will have no effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses these us dollar  indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs as of december 31 the notional value of these contracts was 33530 million the outstanding contracts as of 

  

december 31 2012 are scheduled to mature each month during 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 at december 31 2012 the net unrealized loss on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was 2966 million based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2012 which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 2855 million 

our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk for transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary these contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2013 which are primarily used to hedge our indian rupee denominated net monetary assets at december 31 2012 the notional value of the outstanding contracts was 2086 million and the related fair value was a liability of 52 million based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2012 which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 177 million 

we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 31 2012 we had 28638 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments most of which are impacted almost immediately by changes in shortterm interest rates 

we typically invest in highlyrated securities and our policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss we may sell our investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes in anticipation of credit deterioration or for duration management as of december 31 2012 our shortterm investments totaled 12937 million our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of time deposits mutual funds invested in fixed income securities and us dollar denominated corporate bonds municipal bonds debt issuances by the us government and us government agencies debt issuances by foreign governments and supranational entities and assetbacked securities

industry background 

many companies today face intense competitive pressure and rapidly changing market dynamics driven by such factors as changes in the economy government regulations globalization virtualization and other technology innovations in response to these challenges many companies are focused on improving efficiencies enhancing effectiveness and driving innovation to favorably impact both the bottomline and the topline in order to achieve these goals companies are focusing on a number of services such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these solutions facilitate faster more responsive and lowercost business operations however their development integration and ongoing maintenance present major challenges and require a large number of highlyskilled professionals trained in many diverse technologies and specialized industries in addition companies also require additional technical resources to maintain enhance and reengineer their core legacy it systems and to address application maintenance projects increasingly companies are relying on custom it solutions providers such as us to provide these services 

additionally in order to respond effectively to a changing and challenging business environment it departments of many companies have focused increasingly on improving returns on it investments lowering costs and accelerating the delivery of new systems and solutions to accomplish these objectives many it departments have shifted all or a portion of their it development integration and maintenance requirements to outside service providers operating with global delivery models 

  

global demand for high quality lower cost it services from outside providers has created a significant opportunity for it service providers that can successfully leverage the benefits of and address the challenges in using a global talent pool the effective use of personnel from across the globe can offer a variety of benefits including lower costs faster delivery of new it solutions and innovations in vertical solutions processes and technologies certain countries particularly india the philippines singapore and china have large talent pools of highly qualified technical professionals who can provide high quality it and business and knowledge process outsourcing services at a lower cost india is a leader in it services and is regarded as having one of the largest and highest quality pools of talent in the world historically it service providers have used offshore labor pools primarily to supplement the internal staffing needs of customers however evolving customer demands have led to the increasing acceptance and use of offshore resources for higher valueadded services these services include application design development testing integration and maintenance as well as technology consulting and infrastructure management india’s services and software exports continue to see significant growth nasscom india’s national association of software and service companies reports indicate that india’s it software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to exceed 87 billion at the end of nasscom’s fiscal year 2012 this is an expected growth rate of approximately 15 over the prior fiscal year according to the latest nasscom “perspective 2020 transform business transform india” report global changes and new megatrends within economic demographic business social and environmental areas are set to expand the outsourcing industry by creating new dynamics and opportunities and are expected to result in export revenues of approximately 175 billion by 2020 

using a globally distributed workforce to provide valueadded services presents a number of challenges to it services and bpokpo providers the offshore implementation of valueadded it services requires that it service providers continually and effectively attract train and retain highlyskilled software development professionals with advanced technical and industry skills necessary to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences these skills are necessary to design develop and deploy highquality technology solutions in a costeffective and timely manner in addition it service providers must have the methodologies processes and communications capabilities to enable offshore workforces to be successfully integrated with onsite personnel service providers must also have strong research and development capabilities technology competency centers and relationship management skills in order to compete effectively 

the cognizant approach 

our business is organized and managed primarily around our four verticallyoriented business segments 

 

  

  

  

 this vertical focus has been central to our revenue growth and high customer satisfaction as the it services industry continues to mature clients are looking for service providers who understand their businesses industry initiatives cultures and have solutions tailored to meet their individual business needs we continue to hire experts out of industry establish a broad base of business analysts and consultants invest in industry training for our staff and build out industryspecific services and solutions this approach is central to our highlevels of ontime delivery and customer satisfaction as we understand the full context of our clients’ challenges and have deep experience in addressing them 

  

our key service areas it consulting and technology services and outsourcing services are delivered to our clients across our four business segments in a standardized highquality manner through a global delivery model these service areas include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 business segments 

we are organized around our four vertically–oriented business segments and we report the operations of our business as follows 

 

 financial services 

in 2011 our financial services business segment represented approximately 411 of our total revenues revenues from our financial services business segment were 25184 million 19445 million and 14066 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively this business segment provides services to our customers operating in the following industries

 our solution and services 

we believe that we have developed an effective integrated global delivery business model and this business model is expected to be a critical element of our continued growth to support this business model at december 31 2011 we employed approximately 137700 professionals and support staff globally we also have established facilities and technology and communication infrastructures to support our business model 

across each of our business segments we provide a broad and expanding range of consulting information technology and outsourcing services including 

consulting and technology services 

 

  

  

  

  

 in both of these approaches our onsite team members work closely and collaboratively with our clients detailed design implementation and testing are generally performed at dedicated nearshore and offshore development and delivery centers located primarily in india china the united states canada argentina hungary and the philippines in addition we maintain an onsite presence at each customer location in order to address evolving customer needs and resulting changes to the project 

a key part of our application development and integration offering is a suite of services to help organizations build and integrate business applications with the rest of their operations in this suite of services we leverage our skills in business application development and enterprise application integration to build sophisticated business applications and to integrate these new applications and 

  

websites with client server and legacy systems we build and deploy robust scalable and extensible architectures for use in a wide range of industries we maintain competency centers specializing in various areas such as microsoft solutions ibm sap oracle and java applications and cloud computing and mobile solutions these competency centers enable us to provide application development and integration services to a broad spectrum of customers 

our reengineering service offerings assist customers migrating from systems based on legacy computing environments to newer standardsbased distribution architectures often in response to the more stringent demands of business our reengineering tools automate many of the processes required to implement advanced technology platforms we believe that this automation substantially reduces the time and cost to perform reengineering services savings that benefit both our customers and us these tools also enable us to perform source code analysis and to redesign target databases and convert certain programming languages if necessary our programmers also help customers redesign and convert user interfaces 

 

 outsourcing services 

 

 we provide services to help ensure that a customer’s core operational systems are free of defects and responsive to the customer’s changing needs as part of this process we are often able to introduce product and process enhancements and improve service levels to customers requesting modifications and ongoing support 

our global delivery business model enables us to provide a range of rapid response and costeffective support services to our customers our onsite team members often provide helpdesk services at the customer’s facility these team members typically are available in the event of an emergency service request and are able to quickly resolve customer problems from remote locations in the case of more complex maintenance services including modifications enhancements and documentation which typically have longer turnaround times we take full advantage of our offshore resources to develop solutions more costeffectively than would be possible relying on higher cost local professionals the services provided by our offshore team members are delivered to customers using satellite and fiberoptic communications 

as part of our application maintenance services we assist customers in renovating their core systems to meet the requirements imposed by new regulations new standards or other external events these services include or have previously included year 2000 compliance eurocurrency compliance decimalization within the securities industry and compliance with the health insurance portability and accountability act for the healthcare industry 

we seek to anticipate the operational environment of our customers’ it systems as we design and develop such systems we also offer diagnostic services to customers to assist them in identifying shortcomings in their it systems and optimizing the performance of their systems 

  

  

 in addition to our industryspecific expertise and focus our strengths which we believe differentiate us from other it service providers include the following 

established and scalable proprietary processes we have a comprehensive process framework that addresses the entire software engineering life cycle and support activities which are scalable for projects of different sizes and complexities this proprietary framework which we refer to as “process space” part of cognizant 20 is supported by inhouse project management metrics management and workflow tools and is available to all of our programmers globally process space has evolved since its original release in 1996 in breadth depth and maturity based on the implementation feedback from projects and findings of internal quality audits and external assessments process capabilities are monitored at the subprocess level and performance targets are monitored at the process level which are aligned with the overall business objectives statistical process controls are used extensively to continuously monitor predict and improve performance our delivery assurance group facilitates process implementation from the project inception and audits the projects periodically to ensure that the implementation is effective and the risks are being managed 

our process framework complies with the requirements of iso 9001 tl 9000 for telecom projects and iso 20000 for infrastructure projects our delivery processes support processes and their implementation are formally certified by det norske veritas or dnv in the above mentioned standards kpmg appraises our enterprisewide operations to be at capability maturity model integration or cmmi at a level 5 which is the highest possible maturity level rating of the cmmi v12 of the software engineering institute at carnegie mellon university our bpo service offering is assessed at escm maturity level 4 which is the highest possible rating for the first attempt of the esourcing capability model of it services qualification center at carnegie mellon university finally all of our principal development centers have been certified by the stqc directorate ministry of communications and information technology government of india the accreditation authority for companies in india under the internationally recognized iso 27001 previously bs 77992 information security standards a comprehensive set of controls comprising best practices in information security and business continuity planning we have implemented the above process framework enterprisewide to ensure that we consistently deliver high quality of products and services to our clients from all global operations we have invested considerably in automation to improve process institutionalization across the organization for example we have created and rolled out “cognizant 20” an intelligent delivery ecosystem which orchestrates processes methodologies best practices driving effective usage of knowledge as well as providing a collaborative framework for our worldwide associates cognizant 20 offers a unique blend of collaboration process management and justintime management 

our process framework has been extensively adapted to cater to different types of projects managed by the organization across different service lines such as application development managed services application testing bpo and it infrastructure management in our goal of achieving the highest level of delivery excellence we are also driving an initiative called bestinclass framework throughout the organization 

  

highlyskilled workforce our managers and senior technical personnel provide indepth project management expertise to customers to maintain this level of expertise we place significant emphasis on recruiting and training our workforce of highlyskilled professionals we have approximately 16200 project managers and senior technical personnel around the world many of whom have significant work experience in north america europe and asia we also maintain programs and personnel to hire and train the best available technical professionals in both legacy systems and emerging technologies we provide extensive combined classroom and onthejob training to newly hired technical staff as well as additional annual training programs designed to enhance the business practices tools technology and consulting skills of our professional staff we were assessed by kpmg at level 5 the highest possible rating of the people capability maturity model or pcmm of the software engineering institute at carnegie mellon university this widely recognized means of implementing current best practices in fields such as human resources knowledge management and organizational development help improve our processes for managing and developing our workforce and addressing critical people issues 

research and development and competency centers  we have project experience and expertise across multiple architectures and technologies and have made significant investments in our competency centers and in research and development to keep abreast of the latest technology developments most of our technical staff are trained in multiple technologies and architectures as a result we are able to react to customers’ needs quickly and efficiently redeploy our technical staff to different technologies also to develop and maintain this flexibility we have made a substantial investment in our competency centers so that the experience gained from particular projects and research and development efforts is leveraged across our entire organization in addition through our investment in research and development activities and the continuing education of our technical personnel we enlarge our knowledge base and develop the necessary skills to keep pace with emerging technologies we believe that our ability to work in new technologies allows us to foster longterm relationships by having the capacity to continually address the needs of both existing and new customers 

welldeveloped infrastructure our extensive facilities technology and communications infrastructure facilitate the seamless integration of our global workforces this is accomplished by permitting team members in different locations to access common project information and to work directly on customer projects this infrastructure allows for 

 

  

  

  

 international time differences enable our offshore teams to access a customer’s computing facilities located in north america europe the asia pacific region and other countries in which we provide services during offpeak hours this ability to perform services during offpeak hours enables us to complete projects more rapidly and does not require our customers to invest in duplicative hardware and software in addition for large projects with short time frames our offshore facilities allow for parallel processing of various development phases to accelerate delivery time in addition we can deliver services more rapidly than some competitors without an offshore labor pool because our lower labor costs enable us to costeffectively assign more professionals to a project 

business strategies 

our objectives are to maximize stockholder value and enhance our position as a leading provider of custom information technology consulting and business process outsourcing services we implement the following core strategies to achieve these objectives 

expand service offerings and solutions we have several teams dedicated to creating technologybased innovative solutions and developing new high value services the teams collaborate with customers to develop 

  

these services for example we are currently developing new offerings in business and it consulting and verticallyoriented it solutions atop innovative technologies such as service oriented architectures or soa and web 20 we invest in internal research and development and promote knowledge building and sharing across the organization to advance the development of new services and solutions furthermore we continue to enhance our capabilities and service offerings in the areas of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that the continued expansion of our service offerings will reduce our reliance on any one technology initiative and may help foster longterm relationships with our customers by allowing us to better serve their needs among service offerings infrastructure management and verticallyoriented business and knowledge process outsourcing have been among the key drivers of growth 

as part of our vision to preserve our growth and to stay ahead of our clients’ and the markets’ rapidly changing demands in the nearterm midterm and longterm we are investing in emerging opportunities which seek to transform client and user platforms to internet cloud and mobile based experiences 

further develop longterm customer relationships we have strong longterm strategic relationships with our customers and business partners we seek to establish longterm relationships that present recurring revenue opportunities frequently trying to establish relationships with our customers’ chief information officers or other it and business decision makers by offering a wide array of costeffective high quality services approximately 97 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2010 we also seek to leverage our experience with a customer’s it systems into new business opportunities knowledge of a customer’s processes and it systems gained during the performance of application maintenance services for example may provide us with a competitive advantage in securing additional maintenance development and other projects from that customer 

enhance processes methodologies and productivity toolsets with the globalization of business we are committed to improving and enhancing our proprietary process space software engineering process and other methodologies and toolsets in light of the rapid evolution of technology we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our continued success we are constantly designing and developing additional productivity software tools to automate testing processes and improve project estimation and risk assessment techniques for example we have created and rolled out “cognizant 20” which uses groupware technology based on web 20 technologies enabling cognizant associates to share project experiences and best practice methodologies across the organization with the objective of improving productivity 

expand domestic and international geographic presence  as we expand our customer base we plan to open additional sales and marketing offices in north america europe latin america asia and the middle east this expansion is expected to facilitate sales and services to existing and new customers we have established sales and marketing offices in various metropolitan areas both in the united states and internationally 

continue to be an employer of choice in the industry as a rapidly growing professional services firm a key attribute of our continued success is the ability to continually hire assimilate motivate and retain the best talent possible in the industry we have developed strong relationships with key universities around the world particularly in india to provide a continual funnel of talented staff from tier one schools in addition we 

  

continue to expand our presence and brand in our key supply markets further enhancing our ability to hire experienced professionals from competing it services firms and industry to support our client needs and growth we invest heavily in training programs centered around cognizant academy motivational programs and career development to ensure personal professional growth for each of our associates 

pursue selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances  we believe that opportunities exist in the fragmented market in which we operate to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances we believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence and our capabilities more rapidly especially in geographic markets and key industries for example in 2011 we completed two acquisitions to strengthen our business process and analytics solution offerings and enhance our retail sap capabilities in addition through our working relationships with independent software vendors we obtain projects using the detailed knowledge we gain in connection with a joint development process finally we expect to continue to form strategic alliances with select it service firms that offer complementary services to best meet the requirements of our customers 

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our services directly through our professional staff senior management and direct sales personnel operating out of our teaneck new jersey headquarters and our business development offices which are strategically located in various metropolitan areas around the world the sales and marketing group works with our technical team as the sales process moves closer to the customer’s selection of a services provider the duration of the sales process varies depending on the type of service ranging from approximately two months to over one year the account manager or sales executive works with the technical team to 

 

  

  

  

 management reviews and approves proposals which are then presented to the prospective customer our sales and account management personnel remain actively involved in the project through the execution phase we focus our marketing efforts on businesses with intensive information processing needs we maintain a prospectcustomer database that is continuously updated and used throughout the sales cycle from prospect qualification to close as a result of this marketing system we prequalify sales opportunities and direct sales representatives are able to minimize the time spent on prospect qualification in addition substantial emphasis is placed on customer retention and expansion of services provided to existing customers in this regard our account managers play an important marketing role by leveraging their ongoing relationship with the customer to identify opportunities to expand and diversify the type of services provided to that customer 

customers 

the number of customers served by us has increased significantly in recent years as of december 31 2011 we were providing services to approximately 785 customers as compared to approximately 712 customers as of december 31 2010 and approximately 589 customers as of december 31 2009 as of december 31 2011 we increased the number of strategic clients to 191 we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate at least 5 million to 50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity accordingly we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment however no individual customer exceeded 100 of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services generally would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 785 780 and 791 of our revenue respectively was from north american customers 

  

for the year ended december 31 2011 we derived our revenues from the following business segments 411 from financial services 265 from healthcare 196 from manufacturingretaillogistics and 128 from other 

we provide services either on a timeandmaterial basis or on a fixed price basis the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a significant customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year presented in the table below is additional information about our customers

we have offices and operations in various countries around the world and provide services to clients globally in 2011 approximately 785 of our revenues were attributable to the north american region 179 were attributable to the european region and 36 were attributable to the rest of the world primarily the asia pacific region if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations including regulatory economic political and other uncertainties in india fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates international hostilities terrorism natural disasters and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india and we are subject to regulatory economic political and other uncertainties in india 

we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india where a majority of our technical professionals are located while wage costs are lower in india than in the united states and other developed countries for comparably skilled professionals wages in india have historically increased at a faster rate than in the united states and other countries in which we operate if this trend continues in the future it would result in increased costs for our skilled professionals and thereby potentially reduce our operating margins also there is no assurance that in future periods competition for skilled professionals will not drive salaries higher in india thereby resulting in increased costs for our technical professionals and reduced operating margins 

india has also recently experienced civil unrest and terrorism and has been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries in recent years there have been military confrontations between india and pakistan that have occurred in the region of kashmir and along the indiapakistan border the potential for hostilities between the two countries has been high in light of tensions related to recent terrorist incidents in india and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment including events in and related to afghanistan and iraq if india becomes engaged in armed hostilities particularly if these hostilities are protracted or involve the threat of or use of weapons of mass destruction it is likely that our operations would be materially adversely affected in addition companies may decline to contract with us for services in light of international terrorist incidents or armed hostilities even where india is not involved because of more generalized concerns about relying on a service provider utilizing international resources that may be viewed as less stable than those provided domestically 

in the past the indian economy has experienced many of the problems that commonly confront the economies of developing countries including high inflation erratic gross domestic product growth and shortages of foreign exchange the indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy and indian government actions concerning the economy could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities like us in the past the indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy including the software development services industry programs that have benefited us include among others tax holidays liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation notwithstanding these benefits as noted above india’s central and state governments remain significantly involved in the indian economy as regulators in recent years the indian government has introduced nonincome related taxes including new service taxes and incomerelated taxes including the minimum alternative tax or mat in addition a change in government leadership in india or 

  

change in policies of the existing government in india that results in the elimination of any of the benefits realized by us from our indian operations or the imposition of new taxes applicable to such operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the emergence of a widespread health emergency or pandemic which may be more difficult to prevent or contain in a country like india as compared to more developed countries could create economic or financial disruption that could negatively affect our revenue and operations or impair our ability to manage our business in certain parts of the world 

our international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties 

revenues from customers outside north america represented approximately 215 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 we anticipate that revenues from customers outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence particularly in europe the asia pacific region and the latin america region in addition the majority of our employees along with our development and delivery centers are located in india as a result we may be subject to risks inherently associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may cause volatility in our reported income and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions from time to time we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate our risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations the use of hedging contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of our foreign operations but does not completely eliminate volatility and risk in addition use of hedging contracts includes the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property andor contractual rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in addition we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations additionally such companies may have longstanding or wellestablished relationships with local officials andor desired clients which may put us at a competitive disadvantage we may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture our international expansion plans may not be successful and we may not be able to compete effectively in other countries there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not impede the success of our international expansion plans limit our ability to compete effectively in other countries or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the indian rupee and other foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on the deployment of cash across our global operations 

although we report our operating results in us dollars a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues income from operations other income expense net and the value of balance sheet items originally denominated in other currencies there is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations or that any efforts by us to engage in currency hedging activities will be effective in addition in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which could limit our ability to use these funds across our global operations finally as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee against the us dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency 

  

our operating results may be adversely affected by our use of derivative financial instruments 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in india these contracts are intended to partially offset the impact of the movement of the exchange rates on future operating costs in addition we also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate foreign currency risk on indian rupee denominated net monetary assets the hedging strategies that we have implemented or may in the future implement to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market operational and counterparty credit risks accordingly we may incur losses from our use of derivative financial instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violations of these regulations could harm our business 

because we provide services to clients throughout the world we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal rules on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations violations of these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business damage to our reputation and other unintended consequences such as liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act or uk bribery act among others although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance our employees subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these policies or procedures or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions including fines and suspension or disqualification from government contracting or contracting with private entities in certain highly regulated industries any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

international hostilities terrorist activities other violence or war natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could delay or reduce the number of new service orders we receive and impair our ability to service our customers thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

hostilities involving the united states and acts of terrorism violence or war such as the attacks of september 11 2001 in the united states the attacks of july 7 2005 in the united kingdom the attacks of november 26 2008 and july 13 2011 in mumbai india and the continuing conflict in iraq and afghanistan natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat or perceived potential for these events could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to provide services to our customers such events may cause customers to delay their decisions on spending for information technology consulting and business and knowledge process outsourcing services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our clients which could affect our financial results by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining 

  

and retaining highlyskilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to some or all of our clients as noted above the majority of our technical professionals are located in india and the vast majority of our technical professionals in the united states and europe are indian nationals who are able to work in the united states and europe only because they hold current visas and work permits travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

although we continue to believe that we have a strong competitive position in the united states we continue to increase our efforts to geographically diversify our clients and revenue despite our efforts to diversify hostilities involving the united states the united kingdom india and other countries in which we provide services to our clients and other acts of terrorism violence or war natural disasters global health risks or pandemics may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability while we plan and prepare to defend against each of these occurrences we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our operating results could be adversely affected 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted and negative perceptions associated with offshore outsourcing could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our customers 

the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest market for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by united states companies are periodically considered in the us congress and in numerous state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs domestically on august 13 2010 president barack obama signed legislation which imposed additional fees of 2000 for certain h1b petitions and 2250 for certain l1a and l1b petitions beginning in august 2010 through september 20 2014 these fees have now been extended through september 20 2015 given the ongoing debate over outsourcing the introduction and consideration of other restrictive legislation is possible if enacted such measures may broaden existing restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly or impact private industry with measures that include but are not limited to tax disincentives fees or penalties intellectual property transfer restrictions and new standards that have the effect of restricting the use of certain business andor work visas in the event that any of these measures become law our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to provide services to our customers could be impaired 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as domestic job loss and theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data particularly involving service providers in india current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from utilizing global service delivery providers due to negative perceptions that may be associated with using global service delivery models or firms any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward global service delivery would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide the majority of their services from within the country in which our clients operate 

existing and future legislative and administrativeregulatory policies restricting the performance of business process services from an offshore location in jurisdictions in europe the asia pacific or any other region in which we have clients could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example legislation enacted in the united kingdom based on the 1977 ec acquired rights directive has been adopted in some form by many european union or eu countries and provides that if a company outsources all or part of its business to a service provider or changes its current service provider the 

  

affected employees of the company or of the previous service provider are entitled to become employees of the new service provider generally on the same terms and conditions as their original employment in addition dismissals of employees who were employed by the company or the previous service provider immediately prior to that transfer are automatically considered unfair dismissals that entitle such employees to compensation as a result to avoid unfair dismissal claims we may have to offer and become liable for voluntary redundancy payments to the employees of our clients who outsource business to us in the united kingdom and other eu countries that have adopted similar laws these types of policies may materially affect our ability to obtain new business from companies in the united kingdom and eu and to provide outsourced services to companies in the united kingdom and eu in a costeffective manner 

our growth may be hindered by immigration restrictions 

our future success continues to depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills from developing countries especially india the ability of foreign nationals to work in the united states and europe depends on their ability and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits 

the h1b visa classification enables united states employers to hire certain qualified foreign workers in positions that require an education at least equal to a fouryear bachelor degree in the united states in specialty occupations such as it systems engineering and computer systems analysis the h1b visa usually permits an individual to work and live in the united states for a period of up to six years under certain limited circumstances h1b visa extensions after the sixyear period may be available there is a limit on the number of new h1b petitions that the united states citizenship and immigration services or cis may approve in any federal fiscal year and in years in which this limit is reached we may be unable to obtain h1b visas necessary to bring foreign employees to the united states currently the limit is 65000 for holders of united states or united statesequivalent bachelor degrees the general cap and an additional 20000 for holders of advanced degrees from united states postsecondary educational institutions we began filing h1b petitions with cis against the fiscal year fy 2012 caps beginning april 1 2011 for work in h1b status beginning on october 1 2011 we also have begun planning for h1b filings for fy 2013 as part of our advanced planning process we believe that we have a sufficient number of employees who are permitready to meet our anticipated business growth in the current year in addition there are strict labor regulations associated with the h1b visa classification larger users of the h1b visa program face higher legal and regulatory standards and are often subject to investigations by the wage and hour division of the united states department of labor dol and unannounced random site inspections by cis’s parent agency the united states department of homeland security dhs a finding by dol dhs andor another governmental agency of willful or substantial failure to comply with existing regulations on the h1b classification may result in backpay liability substantial fines andor a ban on future use of the h1b program and other immigration benefits 

we also regularly transfer foreign professionals to the united states to work on projects at client sites using the l1 visa classification companies abroad are allowed to transfer certain managers and executives through the l1a visa and employees with specialized company knowledge through the l1b visa to related united states companies such as a parent subsidiary affiliate joint venture or branch office we have an approved “blanket l” petition under which the corporate relationships of our transferring and receiving entities have been preapproved by cis thus enabling individual l1 visa applications to be presented directly to a visaissuing united states consular post abroad rather than undergoing a preapproval process through cis in the united states in recent years both the united states consular posts in india that review initial l1 applications and cis which adjudicates individual petitions for initial grants and extensions of l1 visa status have become increasingly restrictive with respect to this category particularly the l1b “specialized knowledge” standard as a result the rate of refusals of initial individual l1 petitions and extensions for indian nationals has increased in addition even where l1 visas are ultimately granted and issued security measures undertaken by united states consular posts around the world have delayed or prevented visa issuances our inability to bring qualified technical personnel into the united states to staff onsite customer locations would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

pursuant to the l1 visa reform act we must meet a number of restrictions and requirements to obtain l1 visas for our personnel for example all l1 applicants including those brought to the united states under a blanket l program must have worked abroad with the related company for one full year in the prior three years in addition l1b “specialized knowledge” visa holders may not be primarily stationed at the work site of another employer if the l1b visa holder will be principally controlled and supervised by an employer other than the petitioning employer finally l1b status may not be granted where placement of the l1b visa holder at a third party site is part of an arrangement to provide labor for the third party rather than placement at the site in connection with the provision of a product or service involving specialized knowledge specific to the petitioning employer 

we do not place l1b workers at third party sites where they are under the primary supervision of a different employer nor do we place l1b workers at third party sites in an arrangement to provide labor for the third party without providing a service involving our workers’ specialized knowledge since implementation of the l1 visa reform act we consistently have established this fact to cis’s satisfaction however if cis andor the united states department of state through its visaissuing consular posts abroad decide to interpret these provisions in a very restrictive fashion this could impair our ability to effectively staff our projects in the united states with personnel from abroad new guidance governing these and related statutory provisions from cis is expected in fy 2012 and if such guidance is restrictive in nature our ability to staff our projects in the united states with personnel from abroad will be impaired 

we also process immigrant visas for lawful permanent residence green cards in the united states for employees to fill positions for which there are an insufficient number of able willing and qualified united states workers available to fill the positions compliance with existing united states immigration and labor laws or changes in those laws making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting our ability to successfully obtain permanent residence for our foreign employees in the united states could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the united states any of these restrictions or limitations on our hiring practices could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to immigration restrictions in the united states there are certain restrictions on transferring employees to work in the united kingdom where we have experienced significant growth the united kingdom currently requires that all employees who are not nationals of european union countries plus nationals of bulgaria and romania or eea nationals obtain work permission before obtaining a visaentry clearance to travel to the united kingdom european nations such as hungary poland lithuania slovakia and the czech republic do not have a work permit requirement but employees need to register to work within 30 days of arrival the united kingdom has a pointsbased system under which certain certificates of sponsorship are issued by licensed employer sponsors provided the employees they seek to employ in the united kingdom can accumulate a certain number of points based on certain attributes where the employee has not worked for a cognizant group company outside the united kingdom for at least 6 months we must carry out a resident labor market test to confirm that the intended role cannot be filled by an eea national we are currently an arated sponsor and were allocated certificates of sponsorship which we believe are sufficient to meet our current and expected demand for transfers to the united kingdom on november 23 2010 the united kingdom announced new restrictions to control annual net migration but allowed for temporary intracompany transfers of employees from outside the european economic area for up to five years as long as the employees meet certain compensation requirements 

immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the united states the united kingdom the eu switzerland and other countries are subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement immigration and work permit laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity our international expansion strategy and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed 

  

our revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in the united states and europe as well as on clients concentrated in certain industries including the financial services industry continuing or worsening economic conditions or factors that negatively affect the economic health of the united states europe or these industries may adversely affect our business 

approximately 785 of our revenues during the year ended december 31 2011 were derived from customers located in north america in the same period approximately 179 of our revenues were derived from customers located in europe if the united states or european economy continues to weaken or slow and conditions in the financial markets continue to deteriorate pricing for our services may be depressed and our customers may reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability additionally any prolonged recession in the united states and europe could have an adverse impact on our revenues because our revenues are primarily derived from the united states and europe in addition during the year ended december 31 2011 we earned approximately 411 of our revenues from the financial services industry which includes insurance deterioration in the financial services industry or significant consolidation in that industry or a decrease in growth or consolidation in other industry segments on which we focus may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability in addition if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions affecting the industries and markets in which we operate we may be unable to effectively plan for or respond to those changes and our business could be negatively affected 

we face intense competition from other service providers 

we operate in intensely competitive industries that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards and changes in customer requirements the intensely competitive information technology consulting and business process outsourcing professional services markets include a large number of participants and are subject to rapid change these markets include participants from a variety of market segments including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these markets also include numerous smaller local competitors in the various geographic markets in which we operate which may be able to provide services and solutions at lower costs or on terms more attractive to clients than we can our direct competitors include among others accenture capgemini computer sciences corporation hcl technologies hp enterprise formerly electronic data systems ibm global services infosys technologies perot systems acquired by dell inc tata consultancy services and wipro many of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals there is a risk that increased competition could put downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services and on our operating margins similarly if our competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices without adversely affecting their profit margins even if our offerings address industry and client needs our competitors may be more successful at selling their services if we are unable to provide our clients with superior services and solutions at competitive prices or successfully market those services to current and prospective clients our results of operations may suffer further a client may choose to use its own internal resources rather than engage an 

  

outside firm to perform the types of services we provide we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain our current levels of profitability or growth in the face of competitive pressures including competition for skilled technology professionals and pricing pressure from competitors employing an onsiteoffshore business model 

in addition we may face competition from companies that increase in size or scope as the result of strategic mergers or acquisitions these transactions may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers software companies and vendors and service providers the result of any such vertical integration may be greater integration of products and services that were once offered separately by independent vendors our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of such an industry trend which could adversely affect our competitive position these types of events could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results such as reducing our revenue increasing our costs lowering our gross margin percentage and requiring us to recognize impairments on our assets 

we may not be able to sustain our current level of profitability 

for the year ended december 31 2011 we reported an operating margin of 186 our operating margin may decline if we experience declines in demand and pricing for our services an increase in our operating costs including imposition of new nonincome related taxes or due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition historically wages in india have increased at a faster rate than in the united states additionally the number and type of equitybased compensation awards and the assumptions used in valuing equitybased compensation awards may change resulting in increased stockbased compensation expense and lower margins although we have historically been able to partially offset wage increases and foreign currency fluctuations through further leveraging the scale of our operating structure obtaining price increases and issuing a lower number of stockbased compensation awards in proportion to our overall headcount we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to control our costs or improve our efficiency 

our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency affects our profitability if we are unable to control our costs or improve our efficiency our profitability could be negatively affected 

our business will suffer if we fail to develop new services and enhance our existing services in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological environment 

the information technology consulting and business process outsourcing professional services markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions our future success will depend on our ability to develop solutions that keep pace with changes in the markets in which we provide services we cannot be sure that we will be successful in developing new services addressing evolving technologies in a timely or costeffective manner or if these services are developed that we will be successful in the marketplace in addition we cannot be sure that products services or technologies developed by others will not render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to address the demands of the rapidly evolving technological environment could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to remain competitive will also depend on our ability to design and implement in a timely and costeffective manner solutions for customers that both leverage their legacy systems and appropriately utilize newer technologies such as cloudbased services web 20 models softwareasaservice and service oriented architectures our failure to design and implement solutions in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we may face difficulties in providing endtoend business solutions or delivering complex and large projects for our clients that could cause clients to discontinue their work with us which in turn could harm our business 

we have been expanding the nature and scope of our engagements and have added new service offerings such as it consulting business and knowledge process outsourcing systems integration and outsourcing of entire portions of it infrastructure the success of these service offerings is dependent in part upon continued demand for such services by our existing new and prospective clients and our ability to meet this demand in a costcompetitive and effective manner in addition our ability to effectively offer a wider breadth of endtoend business solutions depends on our ability to attract existing or new clients to these service offerings to obtain engagements for such endtoend solutions we also are more likely to compete with large wellestablished international consulting firms resulting in increased competition and marketing costs accordingly we cannot be certain that our new service offerings will effectively meet client needs or that we will be able to attract existing and new clients to these service offerings 

the increased breadth of our service offerings may result in larger and more complex projects with our clients this will require us to establish closer relationships with our clients and a thorough understanding of their operations our ability to establish such relationships will depend on a number of factors including the proficiency of our professionals and our management personnel our failure to understand our client requirements or our failure to deliver services that meet the requirements specified by our clients could result in termination of client contracts and we could be liable to our clients for significant penalties or damages 

larger projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements these terminations cancellations or delays may result from factors that have little or nothing to do with the quality of our services such as the business or financial condition of our clients or the economy generally such cancellations or delays make it difficult to plan for project resource requirements and inaccuracies in such resource planning and allocation may have a negative impact on our profitability 

if our clients are not satisfied with our services our business could be adversely affected 

our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing clients our business model also depends on our account teams’ ability to develop relationships with our clients that enable us to understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to those needs if a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client in particular clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors in addition negative publicity related to our client services or relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients 

we rely on a few customers for a large portion of our revenues 

our top five customers generated approximately 163 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a major customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year the loss of one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we generally do not have longterm contracts with our customers and our results of operations could be adversely affected if our clients terminate their contracts with us on short notice 

consistent with industry practice we generally do not enter into longterm contracts with our customers a majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice and without significant early termination cost terminations may result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project including the business or financial conditions of the client changes in ownership or management at our clients changes in client strategies or the economy or markets generally when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to eliminate our associated costs in a timely manner consequently our profit margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected if we are unable to replace the lost revenue with other work on terms we find acceptable or effectively eliminate costs we may not be able to maintain our level of profitability 

our results of operations may be affected by the rate of growth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of technology spending by our clients 

our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients as well as their customers and suppliers in challenging economic environments our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities at the same time many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel processes and infrastructures if the growth of technology usage in business or our clients’ spending on technology in business declines or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new technological solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our clients our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions such as the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system could also result in financial difficulties including limited access to the credit markets insolvency or bankruptcy for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

we are investing substantial cash in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately 

we have made and continue to make significant contractual commitments related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our development and delivery centers we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability may be reduced 

  

competition for highlyskilled technical personnel is intense and the success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled professionals 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highlyskilled professionals so as to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in particular we must attract train and retain appropriate numbers of talented people including project managers it engineers and other senior technical personnel with diverse skills in order to serve client needs and grow our business we are particularly dependent on retaining our senior executives and other experienced managers with the skill sets required by our business and if we are unable to do so our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized similarly the profitability of our business model depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to support our projects the processes and costs associated with recruiting training and retaining employees place significant demands on our resources 

we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for professionals with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer we have subcontracted to a limited extent in the past and may do so in the future with other service providers in order to meet our obligations to our customers our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend in large part on our ability to attract train and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences further we must train and manage our growing work force requiring an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel we cannot guarantee that the management skills and systems currently in place will be adequate or that we will be able to train and assimilate new employees successfully our profits and ability to compete for and manage client engagements could be adversely affected if we cannot manage employee hiring and attrition to achieve a stable and efficient workforce structure 

our ability to operate and compete effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel or if we cannot attract additional qualified personnel 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of the key members of our management team as well as marketing sales and technical personnel and our ability to attract and retain new management and other personnel we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or significant employees competition for personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting and retaining new personnel in the future the loss of any one or more of our key personnel or the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

restrictions in noncompetition agreements with our executive officers may not be enforceable 

currently we have entered into noncompetition agreements with the majority of our executive officers we cannot be certain however that the restrictions in these agreements prohibiting such executive officers from engaging in competitive activities are enforceable further substantially all of our professional nonexecutive staff are not covered by agreements that would prohibit them from working for our competitors if any of our key professional personnel leaves our employment and joins one of our competitors our business could be adversely affected 

our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate earnings in india or if such earnings become subject to us tax on a current basis 

effective january 1 2002 and in accordance with authoritative literature we no longer accrue incremental us taxes on our indian earnings recognized after 2001 as these earnings as well as other foreign earnings for all periods are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur that could effectively force us to change our intent not to repatriate such earnings if we 

  

change our intent and repatriate such earnings we will have to accrue taxes associated with such earnings at a substantially higher rate than our effective income tax rate in 2011 these increased taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided by india to companies in our industry as well as by proposed tax legislation in india 

cognizant india is primarily exportoriented and is eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the indian government for export activities these benefits for export activities conducted within software technology parks or stps expired on march 31 2011 and the income from such activities is now subject to corporate income tax at the current rate of 324 resulting in a significant increase in our effective tax rate for 2011 

in addition to stps we have constructed our newer development centers in areas designated as special economic zones or sezs development centers operating in sezs are entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years changes in indian tax laws that would reduce or deny sez tax benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition effective april 1 2011 all indian profits including those generated within sezs are subject to the mat at the current rate of approximately 200 any mat paid is creditable against future corporate income tax subject to limitations currently we anticipate utilizing our existing mat balances against future corporate income tax our ability to fully do so will depend on possible changes to the indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of cognizant india our inability to fully utilize our deferred income tax assets related to the mat could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results and financial condition may be negatively impacted by certain tax related matters 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions the provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods in addition our income tax returns are subject to examination in the jurisdictions in which we operate we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these examinations may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions we predominantly contract to provide services either on a timeandmaterials basis or on a fixedprice basis our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations and utilizing workforces with different skill sets and competencies across geographically diverse service locations our pricing cost and profit margin estimates for the work that we perform frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract there is a risk that we will underprice our projects fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to 

  

accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our profit margin 

in addition a significant portion of our projects are on a fixedprice basis subjecting us to the foregoing risks to an even greater extent fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 317 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 we expect that an increasing number of our future projects will be contracted on a fixedprice basis in addition to the other risks described in the paragraph above we bear the risk of cost overruns and operating cost inflation in connection with projects covered by fixedprice contracts our failure to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a fixedprice project or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within the time frame committed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing rates 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to recover for our services if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our profit margin and our profitability could suffer the rates we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable utilization rates 

the cost of providing our services including the utilization rate of our professionals affects our profitability if we are not able to maintain an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals our profit margin and our profitability may suffer our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

if we do not continue to improve our operational financial and other internal controls and systems to manage our rapid growth and size or if we are unable to enter operate and compete effectively in new geographic markets our business may suffer and the value of our stockholders’ investment in our company may be harmed 

our anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources our growth will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls both in the united states europe india and elsewhere in particular our continued growth will increase the challenges involved in 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the increasing size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that a member of our personnel will engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity breach our contractual obligations or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train our people and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired 

as part of our growth strategy we plan to continue expanding our operations in europe asia the middle east and latin america we may not be able to compete effectively in these markets and the cost of entering these markets may be substantially greater than we expect if we fail to compete effectively in the new markets we enter or if the cost of entering those markets is substantially greater than we expect our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we cannot compete effectively we may be required to reconsider our strategy to invest in our international expansion plans and change our intent on the repatriation of our earnings 

our operating results may experience significant quarterly fluctuations 

historically we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations and expect these fluctuations to continue among the factors causing these variations have been 

 

  

  

  

 in addition our future revenues operating margins and profitability may fluctuate as a result of 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 a high percentage of our operating expenses particularly personnel and rent are relatively fixed in advance of any particular period as a result unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects or in employee wage levels and utilization rates may cause significant variations in our operating results in any particular period and could result in losses any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations any material reduction in utilization rates for our professional staff or variance in the onsiteoffshore staffing mix an unanticipated termination of a major project a customer’s decision not to pursue a new project or proceed to succeeding stages of a current project or the completion of several major customer projects during a quarter could require us to pay underutilized employees and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as a result of these factors it is possible that in some future periods our revenues and operating results may be significantly below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such an event the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 

we could be held liable for damages or our reputation could be damaged by disclosure of confidential information or personal data security breaches or system failures 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and securely store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or data including personal data in addition many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify the theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our or our clients’ confidential information or other proprietary business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce marketplace acceptance of our services any failure in the networks or computer systems used by us or our customers could result in a claim for substantial damages against us and significant reputational harm regardless of our responsibility for the failure although we attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our services we cannot assure you that any contractual limitations on liability will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages 

in addition we often have access to or are required to manage utilize collect and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data including nonpublic personal data as a result we are subject to numerous us and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches controls or procedures with which we are responsible for complying with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data or if unauthorized access to or disclosure of data in our possession or control occurs we could be subject to significant liability to our clients or our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or privacy laws as well as liability and penalties in connection with any violation of applicable privacy laws andor criminal prosecution 

  

unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through breach of computer systems systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation or otherwise could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems and networks or those we develop or manage for our clients whether by our employees or third parties could result in negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation 

although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be sufficient in amount to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability including with respect to our contractual obligations in connection with providing our solutions and services 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our clients we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important economic opportunity by doing so or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines in addition the contracting practices of our competitors may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become standard in the marketplace if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope andor amount of our potential liability if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide solutions and services and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the enforceable terms of our agreements we might face significant legal liability and our business could be adversely affected 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients or other parties with whom we conduct business with respect to certain matters these arrangements can include provisions whereby we agree to hold the indemnified party and certain of their affiliated entities harmless with respect to thirdparty claims related to such matters as our breach of certain representations or covenants or out of our intellectual property infringement our gross negligence or willful misconduct or certain other claims made against certain parties payments by us under any of these arrangements are generally conditioned on the client making a claim and providing us with full control over the defense and settlement of such claim it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically we have not made payments under these indemnification agreements so they have not had any impact on our operating results financial position or cash flows however if events arise requiring us to make payment for indemnification claims under our indemnification obligations in contracts we have entered such payments could have a material impact on our operating results financial position and cash flows 

we could incur liability or our reputation could be damaged if our provision of services and solutions to our clients contributes to our clients’ internal control deficiencies 

our clients may perform audits or require us to perform audits and provide audit reports with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such clients especially when we process data belonging to them our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit in a timely manner additionally we could incur liability if our controls and procedures or the controls and procedures we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures or impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements 

  

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other valuable intellectual property we presently hold no patents or registered copyrights we rely upon a combination of copyright and trade secret laws nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and various security measures to protect our intellectual property rights existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions such as china might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights india is a member of the berne convention and has agreed to recognize protections on copyrights conferred under the laws of foreign countries including the laws of the united states we believe that laws rules regulations and treaties in effect in the united states india and other countries in which we operate are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property however there can be no assurance that these laws will not change in ways that may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components libraries and toolsets and other technology or data we use in the performance of our services among the countries in which we operate and provide services there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of any of our intellectual property or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in development of technology products or services that compete with our products and services and unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products services or proprietary information if we are unable to protect our intellectual property our business may be adversely affected 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed or used in connection with a contract than we generally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create and intend to reuse across multiple client engagements which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

our ability to enforce our software license agreements service agreements and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries to the extent that we seek to enforce our rights we could be subject to claims that an intellectual property right is invalid otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are pursuing a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights or assert other claims against us which could harm our business if we are not successful in defending these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell or license a particular service or solution due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations in addition governments may adopt regulations or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others or governments may require that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others third parties may assert against us or our customers claims alleging infringement of patent copyright trademark or other intellectual property rights to technologies or services that are important to our business infringement claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions in our contracts we generally agree to indemnify our clients for any expenses or liabilities resulting from our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of our liability under these indemnities could be substantial any claims that our products 

  

services or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims may cause us to incur significant costs in defending and resolving such claims and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business in addition as result of such intellectual property infringement claims we could be required or otherwise decide that it is appropriate to 

 

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets which would reduce the value of our assets and increase expenses in addition if we alter or discontinue our offering of affected items or services our revenue could be harmed if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages 

we expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our competitors are able to obtain patents for software products and methods technological solutions and processes we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the primary purpose of asserting such claims against other companies the risk of infringement claims against us may also increase as we continue to develop and license our intellectual property to our clients and other third parties any infringement claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others which could harm our business 

we could lose our ability or be unable to secure the right to utilize the intellectual property of others thirdparty suppliers of software hardware or other intellectual assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired as a result of any such denial our operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to successfully acquire target companies or integrate acquired companies or technologies into our company and we may become subject to certain liabilities assumed or incurred in connection with our acquisitions that could harm our operating results 

if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services we expect to continue pursuing strategic acquisition and joint venture opportunities designed to enhance our capabilities expand our capacity and geographic presence andor enter new technology areas we cannot predict or guarantee that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate any acquisition or joint venture we may need to divert andor dedicate management and other resources to complete the transactions once we have consummated an acquisition transaction or entered into a joint venture transaction we may not be able to integrate the acquired business or joint venture and personnel into our operations recognize anticipated efficiencies andor benefits realize our strategic objectives or achieve the desired financial and operating results in each case both generally and as a result of our unique organizational 

  

structure acquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key personnel and the potential assumption or incurrence of liabilities andor obligations 

although we conduct due diligence in connection with each of our acquisitions there may be liabilities that we fail to discover that we inadequately assess in our due diligence efforts or that are not properly disclosed to us in particular to the extent that any acquired business or any properties thereof i failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations ii failed to fulfill contractual obligations to customers or iii incurred material liabilities or obligations to customers that are not identified during the diligence process we as the successor owner may be financially responsible for these violations failures and liabilities and may suffer financial andor reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected in addition as part of an acquisition we may assume responsibilities and obligations of the acquired business pursuant to the terms and conditions of services agreements entered by the acquired entity that are not consistent with the terms and conditions that we typically accept and require although we attempt to structure acquisitions in such a manner as to minimize our exposure to among other things the factors and conditions contemplated by the foregoing two sentences including through indemnification protection we cannot predict or guarantee that our efforts will be effective or will protect us from liability the discovery of any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions for which we are unable to recover indemnification amounts could harm our operating results 

system failure or disruptions in communications could disrupt our business and result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

to deliver our services to our customers we must maintain a high speed network of satellite fiber optic and land lines and active voice and data communications twentyfour hours a day between our main operating offices in chennai our other development and delivery centers and the offices of our customers worldwide although we maintain redundancy facilities and satellite communications links any systems failure or a significant lapse in our ability to transmit voice and data through satellite and telephone communications could result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting systems integration and technology or outsourcing services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

our ability to attract and retain business may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors since many of our specific client engagements involve unique services and solutions our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our clients’ evaluation of whether to engage our services we believe the cognizant brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former clients competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about our company even if based on false rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business in particular damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts 

  

damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the cognizant brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us adversely affecting our share price 

provisions in our charter bylaws and stockholders’ rights plan and provisions under delaware law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals 

provisions in our charter and bylaws each as amended our stockholders’ rights plan and delaware general corporate law or dgcl may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover proposals or delaying or preventing changes in our control or management including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices in addition these documents and provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests our board of directors has the authority without further action by the stockholders to fix the rights and preferences and issue shares of preferred stock our charter provides for a classified board of directors which will prevent a change of control of our board of directors at a single meeting of stockholders the prohibition of our stockholders’ ability to act by written consent and to call a special meeting will delay stockholder actions until annual meetings or until a special meeting is called by our chairman or chief executive officer or our board of directors the supermajorityvoting requirement for specified amendments to our charter and bylaws allows a minority of our stockholders to block those amendments the dgcl also contains provisions preventing stockholders from engaging in business combinations with us subject to certain exceptions these provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock 

new and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements add uncertainty to our compliance policies and increases our costs of compliance 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to accounting corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 other sec regulations and the nasdaq global select market rules are creating uncertainty for companies like ours these laws regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such corporate governance standards 

in particular our efforts to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors’ audit of that assessment requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources we consistently assess the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting remediate any control deficiencies that may be identified and validate through testing that our controls are functioning as documented while we do not anticipate any material weaknesses the inability of management and our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy and effectiveness respectively of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure and our efforts to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities in addition the laws regulations and standards regarding corporate governance may make it more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with their performance of duties as a result we may face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which could harm our business if we fail to comply with new or changed laws regulations or standards of corporate governance our business and reputation may be harmed 

  

our share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our stockholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls to ensure the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis or be unable to properly report on our business and the results of our operations and the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected 

we are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio 

recent turmoil in the financial markets has adversely affected economic activity in the united states and other regions of the world in which we do business we believe that based on our current cash cash equivalents and investment balances and expected operating cash flows the current lack of liquidity in the credit markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity cash flow or financial flexibility continued deterioration of the credit and capital markets could result in volatility of our investment earnings and impairments to our investment portfolio which could negatively impact our financial condition and reported income the continued decline in economic activity could adversely affect the ability of counterparties to certain financial instruments such as marketable securities and derivatives to meet their obligations to us 

our stock price continues to be volatile 

our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive summary 

in 2011 our revenues increased to 61212 million compared to 45924 million in 2010 net income increased to 8836 million or 285 per diluted share including stockbased compensation expense net of tax equal to 022 per diluted share during 2011 this is compared to net income of 7335 million or 237 per diluted share including stockbased compensation expense and applicable stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense net of tax of 014 per diluted share during 2010 the key drivers of our revenue growth in 2011 were as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we saw a continued demand from our customers for a broad range of it solutions including application maintenance complex systems development engagements testing enterprise resource planning or erp infrastructure management business process outsourcing or bpo and business intelligence we finished the year with approximately 785 active clients compared to approximately 712 as of december 31 2010 and increased the number of strategic clients by 25 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 191 we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate at least 5 million to 50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity our top five and top ten customers accounted for 163 and 277 respectively of our total revenues in 2011 as compared to 179 and 303 respectively for the year ended december 31 2010 as we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to decline over time 

our revenue from european customers increased by 283 to approximately 10975 million in 2011 compared to approximately 8556 million in 2010 revenue from europe excluding the uk increased by approximately 1023 million from approximately 2963 million in 2010 to approximately 3986 million in 2011 and revenue from the uk increased by approximately 1396 million from approximately 5593 million in 2010 to approximately 6989 million in 2011 in 2012 as a result of the ongoing uncertainty in the european economy we expect europe to grow at a slower rate than the rest of the company we believe that europe will continue to be an area of significant investment for us as we see this region as well as the middle east and the asia pacific regions particularly japan india australia and singapore as growth opportunities for the long term 

our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of and strong demand for offshore it software and services and business process outsourcing nasscom india’s national association of software and service companies reports indicate that india’s it software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to exceed 87 billion at the end of nasscom’s fiscal year 2012 this is an expected growth rate of approximately 15 over the prior fiscal year according to the latest nasscom “perspective 2020 transform business transform india” report global changes and new megatrends within economic demographic business social and environmental areas are set to expand the outsourcing industry by creating new dynamics and opportunities and are expected to result in export revenues of 175 billion by 2020 

  

in 2011 our operating margin decreased slightly to 186 compared to 188 in 2010 excluding stockbased compensation expense of approximately 902 million operating margin in 2011 was 200 this was in line with our historic targeted operating margin range excluding stockbased compensation costs and applicable stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 19 to 20 of total revenues operating margin was affected by an increase in compensation and benefit costs including stockbased compensation costs and investments to grow our business including expanded sales and marketing activities partially offset by the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar historically we have invested our profitability above the 19 to 20 operating margin level which excludes stockbased compensation and any related stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense back into our business which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth this investment is primarily focused in the areas of hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise training our technical staff in a broader range of service offerings strengthening our business analytic capabilities strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery and recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees in addition this investment includes maintaining a level of resources trained in a broad range of service offerings to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects for the year ending december 31 2012 we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our targeted operating margin levels back into the business 

we finished the year with total headcount of approximately 137700 which is an increase of approximately 33700 over the prior year the increase in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs to meet the demand for our services is the primary driver of the increase in our operating expenses in 2011 annual turnover including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 132 for 2011 the majority of our turnover occurs in india as a result annualized attrition rates onsite at clients are below our global attrition rate in addition attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation costs in india which may continue in the future however historically this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies 

our current india real estate development program includes planned construction of an additional 105 million square feet of new space between 2011 and the end of 2015 the expanded program includes the expenditure of over 7000 million during this period on land acquisition facilities construction and furnishings to build new companyowned stateoftheart it development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as special economic zones or sezs located in india during 2012 including the indian real estate development program we expect to spend approximately 370 million globally for capital expenditures 

at december 31 2011 we had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 24323 million and working capital of 28758 million accordingly we do not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues during 2011 and 2010 we repurchased approximately 3388 million and 419 million respectively of our class a common stock under our existing stock repurchase program stock repurchases under this program were funded from working capital 

while several measures have indicated that the economy is stabilizing we believe the global economic environment remains fragile during 2012 barring any unforeseen events we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results 

 

  

  

   

  

 in response to this fragile macroeconomic environment we plan to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 critical accounting estimates and risks 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixedbid contracts the allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes valuation of investments goodwill and other longlived assets assumptions used in valuing stockbased compensation awards and derivative financial investments contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts which are predominantly fixedprice contracts are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting under this method total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost cost to cost method this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations contract losses for the periods presented were immaterial 

  

stockbased compensation  utilizing the fair value recognition provisions prescribed by the authoritative guidance stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised the expected volatility of our stock and the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited in addition for performance stock units we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period if actual results differ significantly from our estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and related valuation allowance if any and liabilities requires significant judgment we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate and changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate the consolidated provision for income taxes may also change period to period based on nonrecurring events such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related net interest which can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event we change our determination as to the amount of deferred income tax assets that can be realized we will adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact recorded to income tax expense in the period in which such determination was made 

our indian subsidiaries collectively referred to as cognizant india are primarily exportoriented and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the indian government for export activities these benefits for export activities conducted within stps expired on march 31 2011 the income of our stps is now subject to corporate income tax at the current rate of 324 the expiration of the income tax holiday for stps is the primary driver of the significant increase in our effective tax rate for 2011 we have constructed and expect to continue to locate most of our newer development facilities in sezs which are entitled to certain income tax incentives for export activities for periods up to 15 years effective april 1 2011 all indian profits including those generated within sezs are subject to the mat at the current rate of approximately 200 any mat paid is creditable against future corporate income taxes subject to limitations currently we anticipate utilizing our existing mat balances against future corporate income tax however our ability to fully do so will depend on possible changes to the indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of cognizant india 

derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that each derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date our derivative financial instruments consist of foreign exchange forward contracts we estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange forward contract by using a present value of expected cash flows model this model utilizes various assumptions including but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows discount rates and credit risk factors the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

investments  our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of time deposits and us dollar denominated corporate bonds municipal bonds debt issuances by the us government us government agencies foreign governments and supranational entities and assetbacked securities the assetbacked securities include securities backed by auto loans credit card receivables and other receivables and are rated aaaaaa the years of issuance of our assetbacked securities fall in the 2002 to 2011 range 

we utilize various inputs to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio to the extent they exist unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets level 1 or quoted prices on similar assets level 2 are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in the absence of quoted prices or liquid markets valuation techniques would be used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable level 3 valuation techniques are based on various assumptions including but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows discount rates rate of return and adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity a significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using level 3 inputs the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our security valuation methodologies 

we periodically evaluate if unrealized losses as determined based on the security valuation methodologies discussed above on individual securities classified as available for sale in the investment portfolio are considered to be otherthantemporary the analysis of otherthantemporary impairment requires the use of various assumptions including but not limited to the length of time an investment’s book value is greater than fair value the severity of the investment’s decline any credit deterioration of the investment whether management intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is generally recorded to income and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative creditworthiness of each customer historical collections experience and other information including the aging of the receivables if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant when determining the fair value of our reporting units we utilize various assumptions including projections of future cash flows any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge based upon our most recent evaluation of goodwill there are no significant risks of impairment as of december 31 2011 our goodwill balance was 2888 million 

longlived assets and intangibles  we review longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in general we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset if such assets were determined to be impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks the majority of our development and delivery centers including a majority of our employees are located in india as a result we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights limitations on immigration 

  

programs the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potential geopolitical and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts and potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers we are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the inability of our management to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline see part i item 1a “risk factors”

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data expressed for the three years ended december 31 2011 

dollars in thousands 

 

  

  the following table includes nongaap income from operations excluding stockbased compensation and applicable stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense a measure defined by the securities and exchange commission as a nongaap financial measure this nongaap financial measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies in addition this nongaap measure the financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and reconciliations of our gaap financial statements to such nongaap measure should be carefully evaluated 

we seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin excluding stockbased compensation expense and applicable stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 19 to 20 of revenues accordingly we believe that nongaap income from operations excluding stockbased compensation expense and applicable stockbased indian fringe benefit tax which was repealed during the third quarter of 2009 retroactive to april 1 

  

2009 is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes we use financial statements that do not include stockbased compensation expense and applicable stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors moreover because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use to account for stockbased compensation expense we believe that providing a nongaap financial measure that excludes stockbased compensation expense and applicable stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies accordingly we believe that the presentation of nongaap income from operations when read in conjunction with our reported gaap income from operations can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 

a limitation of using nongaap income from operations versus income from operations reported in accordance with gaap is that nongaap income from operations excludes stockbased compensation expense which is recurring stockbased compensation expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business in addition other companies may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than us thereby limiting the usefulness of this nongaap financial measure as a comparative tool we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from nongaap income from operations and evaluating such nongaap financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap 

a reconciliation of income from operations as reported and nongaap income from operations excluding stockbased compensation expense and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense is as follows for the years ended december 31 

dollars in thousands 

 

 the fringe benefit tax regulation in india obligated us to pay upon exercise or distribution of shares under a stockbased compensation award a nonincome related tax on the appreciation of the award from date of grant to date of vest there was no cash cost to us as we recovered the cost of the indian fringe benefit tax from the employee’s proceeds from the award under us gaap the stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense is required to be recorded as an operating expense and the related recovery of such tax from our employee is required to be recorded to stockholders’ equity as proceeds from a stockbased compensation award during the third quarter of 2009 the indian government repealed the fringe benefit tax retroactive to april 1 2009 

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

revenue  revenue increased by 333 or approximately 15288 million from approximately 45924 million during 2010 to approximately 61212 million in 2011 this increase was primarily attributed

our reportable segments are financial services which includes customers providing banking  transaction processing capital markets and insurance services healthcare which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers manufacturingretaillogistics which includes manufacturers retailers travel and other hospitality customers as well as customers providing logistics services and other which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which individually are less than 100 of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit the other segment includes information media and entertainment services communications and high technology operating segments our sales managers account executives account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve 

our chief operating decision maker evaluates cognizant’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are 

  

subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development and delivery centers certain selling general and administrative expenses excess or shortfall of incentive compensation for delivery personnel as compared to target a portion of depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation expense and the related stockbased indian fringe benefit tax and the impact of the settlements of our cash flow hedges are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker accordingly such expenses are excluded from segment operating profit 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 785 active customers accordingly we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment however no individual customer exceeded 100 of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 or 2009 in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2011 we had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 24323 million we have used and plan to use such cash for expansion of existing operations including our offshore development and delivery centers continued development of new service lines possible acquisitions of related businesses formation of joint ventures stock repurchases and general corporate purposes including working capital as of december 31 2011 we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately 28758 million as compared to working capital of approximately 25875 million as of december 31 2010 accordingly we do not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues 

net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 8752 million for the year ended december 31 2011 7647 million for the year ended december 31 2010 and 6723 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in both years is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income trade 

  

accounts receivable increased from approximately 6263 million at december 31 2009 to approximately 9013 million at december 31 2010 and to approximately 11790 million at december 31 2011 unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately 830 million at december 31 2009 to approximately 1130 at december 31 2010 and to approximately 1396 million at december 31 2011 the increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2011 was due primarily to increased revenues we monitor turnover aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff at december 31 2009 our days sales outstanding including unbilled receivables was approximately 72 days as compared to 71 days as of december 31 2010 and 73 days as of december 31 2011 

our investing activities used net cash of approximately 8503 million for the year ended december 31 2011 4469 million for the year ended december 31 2010 and 3948 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2011 is related to an increase in net purchases of investments an increase in capital expenditures during the year and increased payments for acquisitions the increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2010 as compared to 2009 related to an increase in capital expenditures during the year partially offset by decreased payments for acquisitions and a decrease in net purchases of investments 

our financing activities used net cash of approximately 2555 million for the year ended december 31 2011 and provided net cash of approximately 1200 million for the year ended december 31 2010 and 769 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2011 is primarily related to additional repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program the increase in net cash provided by the financing activities in 2010 as compared to 2009 was related to additional proceeds and excess tax benefits from issuances under our stockbased compensation plans partially offset by additional repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program 

as of december 31 2011 a majority of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed most of the amounts held outside of the united states could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits however other than amounts representing pre2002 undistributed indian earnings for which we have already accrued us taxes our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these amounts to fund our us operations 

our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our longterm capital requirements beyond a twelve month period will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock our continued intent not to repatriate foreign earnings and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we cannot be certain that additional financing if required will be available on terms favorable to us if at all we expect our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months there were no offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2011 2010 and 2009 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources 

  

commitments and contingencies 

as of december 31 2011 we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately 2401 million related to our india development center expansion program which included expenditures for land acquisition facilities construction and furnishings to build new stateoftheart development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as sezs located in india as of december 31 2011 we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

  

  as of december 31 2011 we had 565 million of unrecognized tax benefits this represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution the resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management the outcome of such claims and legal actions if decided adversely is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results cash flows or consolidated financial position additionally many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our clients including any breach involving a customer’s confidential information or sensitive data or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our services there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results financial position and cash flows 

foreign currency risk 

overall we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as approximately 785 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 were generated from customers located in north america however a portion of our costs in india representing approximately 

  

332 of our global operating costs for the year ended december 31 2011 are denominated in the indian rupee and are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations in addition a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may result in nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement in 2011 and 2010 we reported foreign currency exchange losses and gains exclusive of hedging gains or losses of approximately 324 million and 112 million respectively which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of indian rupee net monetary assets on cognizant india’s books to the us dollar functional currency on an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to certain currencies in our foreign subsidiaries primarily the indian rupee 

we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses these hedges to buy indian rupees and sell us dollars are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs during 2011 and 2010 we recorded income of 188 million and 416 million respectively on contracts that settled during each year as of december 31 2011 we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of 11935 million and a weighted average forward rate of 491 rupees to the us dollar scheduled to mature in 2012 outstanding contracts with a notional value of 10800 million and a weighted average forward rate of 504 rupees to the us dollar scheduled to mature in 2013 outstanding contracts with a notional value of 8100 million and a weighted average forward rate of 527 rupees to the us dollar scheduled to mature in 2014 and outstanding contracts with a notional value of 4200 million and a weighted average forward rate of 543 rupees to the us dollar scheduled to mature in 2015 

our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk for transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary these contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2012 which are primarily used to hedge our indian rupee denominated net monetary assets at december 31 2011 the notional value of the outstanding contracts was 2342 million and the related fair value was an asset of 307 million during 2011 inclusive of gains of 236 million on these undesignated balance sheet hedges we reported net foreign currency exchange losses of approximately 88 million 

effects of inflation 

our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals competition in india the united states and europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation as with other service providers in our industry we must adequately anticipate wage increases particularly on our fixedprice contracts historically we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation in india however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2010 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued new guidance clarifying certain disclosure requirements related to business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis specifically the guidance states that if comparative financial statements are presented the entity should 

  

disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combinations that occurred during the current year occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only additionally the new standard expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures required by the authoritative guidance to include a description of the nature and amount of material nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings we adopted the new guidance effective january 1 2011 our adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations however it may result in additional disclosures in the event that we enter into a business combination that is material either on an individual or aggregate basis 

in june 2011 the fasb issued new guidance which requires that comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate consecutive statements thus eliminating the option of presenting the components of comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity in addition the new guidance requires that the reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income be presented on the face of the financial statements in december 2011 the fasb deferred the new requirements related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments the requirement to present comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate consecutive statements has not been deferred and will be effective on a retrospective basis for periods beginning on or after january 1 2012 the adoption of this standard affects financial statement presentation only and will have no effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations 

in september 2011 the fasb issued new guidance related to goodwill impairment testing this standard allows but does not require an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then performing the twostep impairment test is unnecessary however if an entity concludes otherwise then it is required to perform the first step of the twostep impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the new standard gives an entity the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period this new standard will be effective for periods beginning on or after january 1 2012 and will not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations 

in december 2011 the fasb issued guidance requiring enhanced disclosures related to the nature of an entity’s rights to offset and any related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments the new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of setoff amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed and the related net exposure the new guidance will be effective for periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 the adoption of this standard affects financial statement disclosures only and will have no effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain indian rupee denominated payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses these us dollar  indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 the notional value of these contracts was 35035 million and 21600 million respectively the outstanding contracts as of december 31 2011 are scheduled to mature each month during 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 the net unrealized loss gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was 3856 million and 323 million respectively the change in the net unrealized gain loss position from december 31 2010 to december 31 2011 was attributed to the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar in the latter part of 2011 based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2011 which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 2911 million 

our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk for transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary these contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2012 which are primarily used to hedge our indian rupee denominated net monetary assets at december 31 2011 the notional value of the outstanding contracts was 2342 million and the related fair value was an asset of 307 million based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2011 which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 186 million 

  

there were no offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2011 2010 and 2009 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources 

we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 24323 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments most of which are impacted almost immediately by changes in shortterm interest rates 

we typically invest in highly rated securities and our policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss we may sell our investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes in anticipation of credit deterioration or for duration management as of december 31 2011 our shortterm investments totaled 11214 million our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of time deposits and us dollar denominated corporate bonds municipal bonds debt issuances by the us government and us government agencies debt issuances by foreign governments and supranational entities and assetbacked securities

industry background 

many companies today face intense competitive pressure and rapidly changing market dynamics driven by such factors as changes in the economy government regulations globalization virtualization and other technology innovations in response to these challenges many companies are focused on improving efficiencies enhancing effectiveness and driving innovation to favorably impact both the bottomline and the topline in order to achieve these goals companies are focusing on a number of services such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these solutions facilitate faster more responsive and lowercost business operations however their development integration and ongoing maintenance present major challenges and require a large number of highlyskilled professionals trained in many diverse technologies and specialized industries in addition companies also require additional technical resources to maintain enhance and reengineer their core legacy it systems and to address application maintenance projects increasingly companies are relying on custom it solutions providers such as us to provide these services 

additionally in order to respond effectively to a changing and challenging business environment it departments of many companies have focused increasingly on improving returns on it investments lowering costs and accelerating the delivery of new systems and solutions to accomplish these objectives many it departments have shifted all or a portion of their it development integration and maintenance requirements to outside service providers operating with global sourcing models 

  

global demand for high quality lower cost it services from outside providers has created a significant opportunity for it service providers that can successfully leverage the benefits of and address the challenges in using a global talent pool the effective use of personnel from across the globe can offer a variety of benefits including lower costs faster delivery of new it solutions and innovations in vertical solutions processes and technologies certain countries particularly india and china have large talent pools of highly qualified technical professionals who can provide high quality it and business and knowledge process outsourcing services at a lower cost india is a leader in it services and is regarded as having one of the largest and highest quality pools of talent in the world historically it service providers have used offshore labor pools primarily to supplement the internal staffing needs of customers however evolving customer demands have led to the increasing acceptance and use of offshore resources for higher valueadded services these services include application design development testing integration and maintenance as well as technology consulting and infrastructure management india’s services and software exports continue to see significant growth nasscom india’s national association of software and service companies reports indicate that india’s it software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to exceed 76 billion at the end of nasscom’s fiscal year 2011 this is a growth rate of approximately 19 over the prior fiscal year according to the latest nasscom “perspective 2020 transform business transform india” report global changes and new megatrends within economic demographic business social and environmental areas are set to expand the outsourcing industry by creating new dynamics and opportunities and are expected to result in export revenues of approximately 175 billion by 2020 

using a globally distributed workforce to provide valueadded services presents a number of challenges to it services and bpokpo providers the offshore implementation of valueadded it services requires that it service providers continually and effectively attract train and retain highlyskilled software development professionals with advanced technical and industry skills necessary to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences these skills are necessary to design develop and deploy highquality technology solutions in a costeffective and timely manner in addition it service providers must have the methodologies processes and communications capabilities to enable offshore workforces to be successfully integrated with onsite personnel service providers must also have strong research and development capabilities technology competency centers and relationship management skills in order to compete effectively 

the cognizant approach 

our business is organized and managed primarily around our four verticallyoriented business segments 

 

  

  

  

 this vertical focus has been central to our revenue growth and high customer satisfaction as the it services industry continues to mature clients are looking for service providers who understand their businesses industry initiatives culture and have solutions tailored to meet their individual business needs we have continued to hire experts out of industry establish a broad base of business analysts and consultants invest in industry training for our staff and build out industryspecific services and solutions this approach is central to our highlevels of ontime delivery and customer satisfaction as we understand the full context of our clients’ challenges and have deep experience in addressing them 

  

our key service areas it consulting and technology services and outsourcing services are delivered to our clients across our four business segments in a standardized highquality manner through a global delivery model these service areas include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 business segments 

we are organized around our four vertically–oriented business segments and we report the operations of our business as follows 

 

 financial services 

in 2010 our financial services business segment represented approximately 424 of our total revenues revenues from our financial services business segment were 19445 million 14066 million and 12840 million for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively this business segment provides services to our customers operating in the following industries

 our solution and services 

we believe that we have developed an effective integrated global delivery business model and this business model is expected to be a critical element of our continued growth to support this business model at december 31 2010 we employed approximately 104000 professionals and support staff globally we also have established facilities and technology and communication infrastructures to support our business model 

across each of our business segments we provide a broad and expanding range of consulting information technology and outsourcing services including 

consulting and technology services 

 

  

  

  

  

 in both of these approaches our onsite team members work closely and collaboratively with our clients detailed design implementation and testing are generally performed at dedicated nearshore and offshore development and delivery centers located primarily in india china the united states canada argentina hungary and the philippines in addition we maintain an onsite presence at each customer location in order to address evolving customer needs and resulting changes to the project 

a key part of our application development and integration offering is a suite of services to help organizations build and integrate business applications with the rest of their operations in this suite of services we leverage our skills in business application development and enterprise application integration to build sophisticated business applications and to integrate these new applications and websites with client server and legacy systems we build and deploy robust scalable and extensible architectures for use in a wide range of industries we maintain competency centers specializing in 

  

various areas such as microsoft solutions ibm sap oracle and java applications and cloud computing and mobile solutions these competency centers enable us to provide application development and integration services to a broad spectrum of customers 

our reengineering service offerings assist customers migrating from systems based on legacy computing environments to newer standardsbased distribution architectures often in response to the more stringent demands of business our reengineering tools automate many of the processes required to implement advanced technology platforms we believe that this automation substantially reduces the time and cost to perform reengineering services savings that benefit both our customers and us these tools also enable us to perform source code analysis and to redesign target databases and convert certain programming languages if necessary our programmers also help customers redesign and convert user interfaces 

 

 outsourcing services 

 

 we provide services to help ensure that a customer’s core operational systems are free of defects and responsive to the customer’s changing needs as part of this process we are often able to introduce product and process enhancements and improve service levels to customers requesting modifications and ongoing support 

our global delivery business model enables us to provide a range of rapid response and costeffective support services to our customers our onsite team members often provide helpdesk services at the customer’s facility these team members typically are available in the event of an emergency service request and are able to quickly resolve customer problems from remote locations in the case of more complex maintenance services including modifications enhancements and documentation which typically have longer turnaround times we take full advantage of our offshore resources to develop solutions more costeffectively than would be possible relying on higher cost local professionals the services provided by our offshore team members are delivered to customers using satellite and fiberoptic communications 

as part of our application maintenance services we assist customers in renovating their core systems to meet the requirements imposed by new regulations new standards or other external events these services include or have previously included year 2000 compliance eurocurrency compliance decimalization within the securities industry and compliance with the health insurance portability and accountability act for the healthcare industry 

we seek to anticipate the operational environment of our customers’ it systems as we design and develop such systems we also offer diagnostic services to customers to assist them in identifying shortcomings in their it systems and optimizing the performance of their systems 

 

   

  

 in addition to our industryspecific expertise and focus our strengths which we believe differentiate us from other it service providers include the following 

established and scalable proprietary processes we have a comprehensive process framework that addresses the entire software engineering life cycle and support activities which are scalable for projects of different sizes and complexities this proprietary framework which we refer to as “process space” part of cognizant 20 is supported by inhouse project management metrics management and workflow tools and is available to all of our programmers globally process space has evolved since its original release in 1996 in breadth depth and maturity based on the implementation feedback from projects and findings of internal quality audits and external assessments process capabilities are monitored at the subprocess level and performance targets are monitored at the process level which are aligned with the overall business objectives statistical process controls are used extensively to continuously monitor predict and improve performance our quality assurance group facilitates process implementation from the project inception and audits the projects periodically to ensure that the implementation is effective and the risks are being managed 

our process framework complies with the requirements of iso 9001 tl 9000 for telecom projects and iso 20000 for infrastructure projects our delivery processes support processes and their implementation are formally certified by det norske veritas or dnv in the above mentioned standards kpmg appraises our enterprisewide operations to be at cmmi maturity level 5 which is the highest possible maturity level rating of the capability maturity model integration v12 or cmmi of the software engineering institute at carnegie mellon university our bpo service offering is assessed at escm maturity level 4 which is the highest possible rating for the first attempt of the esourcing capability model of it services qualification center at carnegie mellon university finally all of our principal development centers have been certified by the stqc directorate ministry of communications and information technology government of india the accreditation authority for companies in india under the internationally recognized iso 27001 previously bs 77992 information security standards a comprehensive set of controls comprising best practices in information security and business continuity planning we have implemented the above process framework enterprisewide to ensure that we consistently deliver high quality of products and services to our clients from all global operations we have invested considerably in automation to improve process institutionalization across the organization for example we have created and rolled out “cognizant 20” an intelligent delivery ecosystem which orchestrates processes methodologies best practices driving effective usage of knowledge as well as providing a collaborative framework for our worldwide associates cognizant 20 offers a unique blend of collaboration process management and justintime management 

our process framework has been extensively adapted to cater to different types of projects managed by the organization including application development application maintenance testing mass change data migration reengineering business process outsourcing it infrastructure and package development projects 

highlyskilled workforce our managers and senior technical personnel provide indepth project management expertise to customers to maintain this level of expertise we have placed significant emphasis on recruiting and training our workforce of highlyskilled professionals we have approximately 12200 project 

  

managers and senior technical personnel around the world many of whom have significant work experience in north america europe and asia we also maintain programs and personnel to hire and train the best available technical professionals in both legacy systems and emerging technologies we provide extensive combined classroom and onthejob training to newly hired programmers as well as additional annual training programs designed to enhance the business practices tools technology and consulting skills of our professional staff we were assessed by kpmg at level 5 the highest possible rating of the people capability maturity model or pcmm of the software engineering institute at carnegie mellon university this widely recognized means of implementing current best practices in fields such as human resources knowledge management and organizational development help improve our processes for managing and developing our workforce and addressing critical people issues 

research and development and competency centers  we have project experience and expertise across multiple architectures and technologies and have made significant investments in our competency centers and in research and development to keep abreast of the latest technology developments most of our programmers are trained in multiple technologies and architectures as a result we are able to react to customers’ needs quickly and efficiently redeploy programmers to different technologies also to develop and maintain this flexibility we have made a substantial investment in our competency centers so that the experience gained from particular projects and research and development efforts is leveraged across our entire organization in addition through our investment in research and development activities and the continuing education of our technical personnel we enlarge our knowledge base and develop the necessary skills to keep pace with emerging technologies we believe that our ability to work in new technologies allows us to foster longterm relationships by having the capacity to continually address the needs of both existing and new customers 

welldeveloped infrastructure our extensive facilities technology and communications infrastructure facilitate the seamless integration of our global workforces this is accomplished by permitting team members in different locations to access common project information and to work directly on customer projects this infrastructure allows for 

 

  

  

  

 international time differences enable our offshore teams to access a customer’s computing facilities located in north america europe the asia pacific region and other countries in which we provide services during offpeak hours this ability to perform services during offpeak hours enables us to complete projects more rapidly and does not require our customers to invest in duplicative hardware and software in addition for large projects with short time frames our offshore facilities allow for parallel processing of various development phases to accelerate delivery time in addition we can deliver services more rapidly than some competitors without an offshore labor pool because our lower labor costs enable us to costeffectively assign more professionals to a project 

business strategies 

our objectives are to maximize stockholder value and enhance our position as a leading provider of custom information technology consulting and business process outsourcing services we implement the following core strategies to achieve these objectives 

further develop longterm customer relationships we have strong longterm strategic relationships with our customers and business partners we seek to establish longterm relationships that present recurring revenue opportunities frequently trying to establish relationships with our customers’ chief information officers or other it decision makers by offering a wide array of costeffective high quality services approximately 97 of our 

  

revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2009 we also seek to leverage our experience with a customer’s it systems into new business opportunities knowledge of a customer’s processes and it systems gained during the performance of application maintenance services for example may provide us with a competitive advantage in securing additional maintenance development and other projects from that customer 

expand service offerings and solutions we have several teams dedicated to developing new high value services these teams collaborate with customers to develop these services for example we are currently developing new offerings in business and it consulting and verticallyoriented it solutions atop innovative technologies such as service oriented architectures soa and web 20 we invest in internal research and development and promote knowledge building and sharing across the organization to promote the development of new services and solutions furthermore we continue to enhance our capabilities and service offerings in the areas of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that the continued expansion of our service offerings will reduce our reliance on any one technology initiative and may help foster longterm relationships with our customers by allowing us to better serve their needs among service offerings infrastructure management and verticallyoriented business and knowledge process outsourcing have been among the key drivers of growth 

enhance processes methodologies and productivity toolsets with the globalization of business we are committed to improving and enhancing our proprietary process space software engineering process and other methodologies and toolsets in light of the rapid evolution of technology we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our continued success we are constantly designing and developing additional productivity software tools to automate testing processes and improve project estimation and risk assessment techniques for example we have created and rolled out “cognizant 20” which uses groupware technology based on web 20 technologies enabling cognizant associates to share project experiences and best practice methodologies across the organization with the objective of improving productivity 

expand domestic and international geographic presence  as we expand our customer base we plan to open additional sales and marketing offices in north america europe latin america and asia this expansion is expected to facilitate sales and service to existing and new customers we have established sales and marketing offices in various metropolitan areas both in the united states and internationally 

continue to be an employer of choice in the industry as a rapidly growing professional services firm a key attribute of our continued success is the ability to continually hire assimilate motivate and retain the best talent possible in the industry we have developed strong relationships with key universities around the world particularly in india to provide a continual funnel of talented staff from tier one schools in addition we continue to expand our presence and brand in our key supply markets further enhancing our ability to hire experienced professionals from competing it services firms and industry to support our client needs and growth we invest heavily in training programs centered around cognizant academy motivational programs and career development to ensure personal professional growth for each of our associates 

pursue selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances  we believe that opportunities exist in the fragmented market in which we operate to expand our business through selective 

  

strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances we believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence and our capabilities more rapidly especially in geographic markets and key industries for example in 2010 we completed three acquisitions to strengthen our business process outsourcing expertise within our logistic services our business transformation and program management capabilities and to expand our testing services within europe in addition through our working relationships with independent software vendors we obtain projects using the detailed knowledge we gain in connection with a joint development process finally we expect to continue to form strategic alliances with select it service firms that offer complementary services to best meet the requirements of our customers 

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our services directly through our professional staff senior management and direct sales personnel operating out of our teaneck new jersey headquarters and our business development offices which are strategically located in various metropolitan areas around the world the sales and marketing group works with our technical team as the sales process moves closer to the customer’s selection of a services provider the duration of the sales process varies depending on the type of service ranging from approximately two months to over one year the account manager or sales executive works with the technical team to 

 

  

  

  

 management reviews and approves proposals which are then presented to the prospective customer our sales and account management personnel remain actively involved in the project through the execution phase we focus our marketing efforts on businesses with intensive information processing needs we maintain a prospectcustomer database that is continuously updated and used throughout the sales cycle from prospect qualification to close as a result of this marketing system we prequalify sales opportunities and direct sales representatives are able to minimize the time spent on prospect qualification in addition substantial emphasis is placed on customer retention and expansion of services provided to existing customers in this regard our account managers play an important marketing role by leveraging their ongoing relationship with the customer to identify opportunities to expand and diversify the type of services provided to that customer 

customers 

the number of customers served by us has increased significantly in recent years as of december 31 2010 we were providing services to approximately 712 customers as compared to approximately 589 customers as of december 31 2009 and approximately 565 customers as of december 31 2008 accordingly we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment however no individual customer exceeded 100 of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 780 791 and 791 of our revenue respectively was from north american customers 

for the year ended december 31 2010 we derived our revenues from the following business segments 424 from financial services 256 from healthcare 185 from retailmanufacturinglogistics and 135 from other 

  

we provide services either on a timeandmaterial basis or on a fixed price basis the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a significant customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the risks and uncertainties detailed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

our global operations are subject to complex risks some of which might be beyond our control 

we have offices and operations in various countries around the world and provide services to clients globally in 2010 approximately 780 of our revenues were attributable to the north american region 186 were attributable to the european region and 34 were attributable to the rest of the world primarily the asia pacific region if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations including regulatory economic political and other uncertainties in india fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates international hostilities terrorism natural disasters and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india and we are subject to regulatory economic political and other uncertainties in india 

we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india where a majority of our technical professionals are located while wage costs are lower in india than in the united states and other 

  

developed countries for comparably skilled professionals wages in india have historically increased at a faster rate than in the united states if this trend continues in the future it would result in increased costs for our skilled professionals and thereby potentially reduce our operating margins also there is no assurance that in future periods competition for skilled professionals will not drive salaries higher in india thereby resulting in increased costs for our technical professionals and reduced operating margins 

india has also recently experienced civil unrest and terrorism and has been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries in recent years there have been military confrontations between india and pakistan that have occurred in the region of kashmir and along the indiapakistan border the potential for hostilities between the two countries has been high in light of tensions related to recent terrorist incidents in india and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment including events in and related to afghanistan and iraq if india becomes engaged in armed hostilities particularly if these hostilities are protracted or involve the threat of or use of weapons of mass destruction it is likely that our operations would be materially adversely affected in addition companies may decline to contract with us for services in light of international terrorist incidents or armed hostilities even where india is not involved because of more generalized concerns about relying on a service provider utilizing international resources that may be viewed as less stable than those provided domestically 

in the past the indian economy has experienced many of the problems that commonly confront the economies of developing countries including high inflation erratic gross domestic product growth and shortages of foreign exchange the indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy and indian government actions concerning the economy could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities like us in the past the indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy including the software development services industry programs that have benefited us include among others tax holidays liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation notwithstanding these benefits as noted above india’s central and state governments remain significantly involved in the indian economy as regulators in recent years the indian government has introduced nonincome related taxes including the fringe benefit tax which was repealed as of april 1 2009 and new service taxes and incomerelated taxes including the minimum alternative tax in addition a change in government leadership in india or change in policies of the existing government in india that results in the elimination of any of the benefits realized by us from our indian operations or the imposition of new taxes applicable to such operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the emergence of a widespread health emergency or pandemic which may be more difficult to prevent or contain in a country like india as compared to more developed countries could create economic or financial disruption that could negatively affect our revenue and operations or impair our ability to manage our business in certain parts of the world 

our international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties 

revenues from customers outside north america represented approximately 220 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 we anticipate that revenues from customers outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence particularly in europe the asia pacific region and the latin america region in addition the majority of our employees along with our development and delivery centers are located in india as a result we may be subject to risks inherently associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may cause volatility in our reported income and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions from time to time we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate our risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations the use 

  

of hedging contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of our foreign operations but does not completely eliminate volatility and risk in addition use of hedging contracts includes the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property andor contractual rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in addition we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations additionally such companies may have longstanding or wellestablished relationships with local officials andor desired clients which may put us at a competitive disadvantage we may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture our international expansion plans may not be successful and we may not be able to compete effectively in other countries there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not impede the success of our international expansion plans limit our ability to compete effectively in other countries or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the indian rupee and other foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on the deployment of cash across our global operations 

although we report our operating results in us dollars a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues income from operations other income expense net and the value of balance sheet items originally denominated in other currencies there is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations or that any efforts by us to engage in currency hedging activities will be effective in addition in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which could limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations finally as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee against the us dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency 

our operating results may be adversely affected by our use of derivative financial instruments 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in india these contracts are intended to partially offset the impact of the movement of the exchange rates on future operating costs in addition we also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate foreign currency risk on indian rupee denominated net monetary assets the hedging strategies that we have implemented or may in the future implement to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market operational and counterparty credit risks accordingly we may incur losses from our use of derivative financial instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violations of these regulations could harm our business 

because we provide services to clients throughout the world we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal rules on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor 

  

relations violations of these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business damage to our reputation and other unintended consequences such as liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance our employees subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these policies or procedures or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions including fines and suspension or disqualification from government contracting or contracting with private entities in certain highly regulated industries any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

international hostilities terrorist activities other violence or war natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could delay or reduce the number of new service orders we receive and impair our ability to service our customers thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

hostilities involving the united states and acts of terrorism violence or war such as the attacks of september 11 2001 in the united states the attacks of july 7 2005 in the united kingdom the attacks of november 26 2008 in mumbai india and the continuing conflict in iraq and afghanistan natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat or perceived potential for these events could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to provide services to our customers such events may cause customers to delay their decisions on spending for information technology consulting and business and knowledge process outsourcing services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our clients which could affect our financial results by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to some or all of our clients as noted above the majority of our technical professionals are located in india and the vast majority of our technical professionals in the united states and europe are indian nationals who are able to work in the united states and europe only because they hold current visas and work permits travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

although we continue to believe that we have a strong competitive position in the united states we continue to increase our efforts to geographically diversify our clients and revenue despite our efforts to diversify hostilities involving the united states the united kingdom india and other countries in which we provide services to our clients and other acts of terrorism violence or war natural disasters global health risks or pandemics may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability while we plan and prepare to defend against each of these occurrences we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our operating results could be adversely affected 

  

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted and negative perceptions associated with offshore outsourcing could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our customers 

the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest market for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by united states companies are periodically considered in the us congress and in numerous state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs domestically on august 13 2010 president barack obama signed public law 111230 which contained provisions to impose additional fees of 2000 for certain h1b petitions and 2250 for certain l1a and l1b petitions beginning in august 2010 through september 20 2014 these fees were extended through september 20 2015 in public law 111347 in 2010 senators richard durbin dillinois and charles grassley riowa introduced a bill that would if enacted further and severely restrict the use of certain temporary business visas given the ongoing debate over this issue the introduction and consideration of other restrictive legislation is possible if enacted such measures may broaden restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly or impact private industry with measures such as tax disincentives andor penalties or intellectual property transfer restrictions andor restrict the use of certain business andor work visas in the event that any of these measures become law our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to provide services to our customers could be impaired 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data particularly involving service providers in india current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to offshore providers due to negative perceptions that may be associated with using an offshore provider any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward offshore outsourcing would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide the majority of their services from within the country in which our clients operate 

legislation and administrativeregulatory policies enacted in certain european jurisdictions and any future legislationregulation in europe countries within the asia pacific region or any other country in which we have clients restricting the performance of business process services from an offshore location could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example legislation enacted in the united kingdom based on the 1977 ec acquired rights directive has been adopted in some form by many european union or eu countries and provides that if a company outsources all or part of its business to a service provider or changes its current service provider the affected employees of the company or of the previous service provider are entitled to become employees of the new service provider generally on the same terms and conditions as their original employment in addition dismissals of employees who were employed by the company or the previous service provider immediately prior to that transfer are automatically considered unfair dismissals that entitle such employees to compensation as a result in order to avoid unfair dismissal claims we may have to offer and become liable for voluntary redundancy payments to the employees of our clients who outsource business to us in the united kingdom and other eu countries who have adopted similar laws these types of policies may materially affect our ability to obtain new business from companies in the united kingdom and eu and to provide outsourced services to companies in the united kingdom and eu in a costeffective manner 

our growth may be hindered by immigration restrictions 

our future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills from developing countries especially india the vast majority of our professionals in the united states and in europe are indian nationals the ability of indian nationals to work in the united states and europe depends on their ability and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits 

  

the h1b visa classification enables united states employers to hire qualified foreign workers in positions that require an education at least equal to a fouryear bachelor degree in the united states in specialty occupations such as it systems engineering and computer systems analysis the h1b visa usually permits an individual to work and live in the united states for a period of up to six years under certain limited circumstances h1b visa extensions after the sixyear period may be available there is a limit on the number of new h1b petitions that the united states citizenship and immigration services or cis one of the successor agencies to the immigration and naturalization service may approve in any federal fiscal year and in years in which this limit is reached we may be unable to obtain h1b visas necessary to bring foreign employees to the united states currently the limit is 65000 for holders of united states or united statesequivalent bachelor degrees the general cap and an additional 20000 for holders of advanced degrees from united states postsecondary educational institutions we began filing h1b petitions with cis against the fiscal year 2011 caps beginning april 1 2010 for work in h1b status beginning on october 1 2011 on january 21 2011 cis reached its advanced degree cap for fiscal year 2011 and on january 27 2011 cis reached its general cap for fiscal year 2011 we plan to begin filing h1b petitions with cis against the fiscal year 2012 caps beginning april 1 2011 for work in h1b status beginning on october 1 2011 as part of our advanced planning process we believe that we have a sufficient number of employees visaready to meet our anticipated business growth in the current year in addition there are strict labor regulations associated with the h1b visa classification larger users of the h1b visa program are often subject to investigations by the wage and hour division of the united states department of labor a finding by the united states department of labor of willful or substantial failure to comply with existing regulations on the h1b classification may result in backpay liability substantial fines andor a ban on future use of the h1b program and other immigration benefits 

we also regularly transfer employees from india to the united states to work on projects at client sites using the l1 visa classification the l1 visa allows companies abroad to transfer certain managers executives and employees with specialized company knowledge to related united states companies such as a parent subsidiary affiliate joint venture or branch office we have an approved “blanket l program” under which the corporate relationships of our transferring and receiving entities have been preapproved by cis thus enabling individual l1 visa applications to be presented directly to a visaissuing united states consular post abroad rather than undergoing a preapproval process through cis in the united states in recent years both the united states consular posts that review initial l1 applications and cis which adjudicates petitions for initial grants and extensions of l1 status have become increasingly restrictive with respect to this category as a result the rate of refusals of initial l1 petitions and extensions has increased in addition even where l1 visas are ultimately granted and issued security measures undertaken by united states consular posts around the world have delayed visa issuances our inability to bring qualified technical personnel into the united states to staff onsite customer locations would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

pursuant to the l1 visa reform act which became effective in june 2005 there are a number of restrictions and requirements that must be met in order for us to obtain l1 visas for our personnel under one provision of the l1 visa reform act all l1 applicants including those brought to the united states under a blanket l program must have worked abroad with the related company for one full year in the prior three years in addition l1b holders intracompany transferees with specialized company knowledge may not be primarily stationed at the work site of another employer if the l1b visa holder will be controlled and supervised by an employer other than the petitioning employer finally l1b status may not be granted where placement of the l1b visa holder at a third party site is part of an arrangement to provide labor for the third party rather than placement at the site in connection with the provision of a product or service involving specialized knowledge specific to the petitioning employer 

we do not place l1b workers at third party sites where they are under the primary supervision of a different employer nor do we place l1b workers at third party sites in an arrangement to provide labor for the third party without providing a service involving our specialized knowledge since implementation of the l1 

  

visa reform act we consistently have established this fact to cis’s satisfaction however if cis andor the united states department of state through its visaissuing consular posts abroad decide to interpret these provisions in a very restrictive fashion this could impair our ability to staff our projects in the united states with resources from our entities abroad in addition cis has not yet issued regulations governing these statutory provisions if such regulations are restrictive in nature our ability to staff our projects in the united states with resources from our entities abroad will be impaired 

we also process immigrant visas for lawful permanent residence in the united states for employees to fill positions for which there are an insufficient number of able willing and qualified united states workers available to fill the positions compliance with existing united states immigration and labor laws or changes in those laws making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting our ability to successfully obtain permanent residence for our foreign employees in the united states could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the united states any of these restrictions or limitations on our hiring practices could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to immigration restrictions in the united states there are certain restrictions on transferring employees to work in the united kingdom where we have experienced significant growth the united kingdom currently requires that all employees who are not nationals of european union countries plus nationals of bulgaria and romania or eea nationals obtain work permission before obtaining a visaentry clearance to travel to the united kingdom european nations such as hungary poland lithuania slovakia and the czech republic do not have a work permit requirement but employees need to register to work within 30 days of arrival on november 27 2008 the united kingdom introduced a pointsbased system under which certain certificates of sponsorship are issued by licensed employer sponsors provided the employees they seek to employ in the united kingdom can accumulate a certain number of points based on certain attributes where the employee has not worked for a cognizant group company outside the united kingdom for at least 6 months we will need to carry out a resident labor market test to confirm that the intended role cannot be filled by an eea national we are currently an arated sponsor and were allocated certificates of sponsorship which we believe are sufficient to meet our current and expected demand for transfers to the united kingdom on november 23 2010 the united kingdom announced new restrictions to control annual net migration but allowed for temporary intracompany transfers of employees from outside the european economic area for up to five years as long as the employees meet certain compensation requirements 

immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the united states the united kingdom the eu switzerland and other countries are subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement immigration and work permit laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity our international expansion strategy and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed 

our revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in the united states and europe as well as on clients concentrated in certain industries including the financial services industry continuing or worsening economic conditions or factors that negatively affect the economic health of the united states europe or these industries may adversely affect our business 

approximately 780 of our revenues during the year ended december 31 2010 were derived from customers located in north america in the same period approximately 186 of our revenues were derived from customers located in europe if the united states or european economy continues to weaken or slow and conditions in the financial markets continue to deteriorate pricing for our services may be depressed and our customers may reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand 

  

for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability additionally any prolonged recession in the united states and europe could have an adverse impact on our revenues because a large portion of our revenues are derived from the united states and europe in addition during the year ended december 31 2010 we earned approximately 424 of our revenues from the financial services industry which includes insurance a deterioration in the financial services industry and significant consolidation in that industry or a decrease in growth or consolidation in other industry segments on which we focus may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability in addition if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions affecting the industries and markets in which we operate we may be unable to effectively plan for or respond to those changes and our business could be negatively affected 

we face intense competition from other service providers 

the intensely competitive information technology consulting and business process outsourcing professional services markets include a large number of participants and are subject to rapid change these markets include participants from a variety of market segments including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these markets also include numerous smaller local competitors in the various geographic markets in which we operate which may be able to provide services and solutions at lower costs or on terms more attractive to clients than we can our direct competitors include among others accenture capgemini computer sciences corporation hcl technologies hp enterprise formerly electronic data systems ibm global services infosys technologies perot systems acquired by dell inc tata consultancy services and wipro many of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals there is a risk that increased competition could put downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services and on our operating margins similarly if our competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices without adversely affecting their profit margins even if our offerings address industry and client needs our competitors may be more successful at selling their services if we are unable to provide our clients with superior services and solutions at competitive prices or successfully market those services to current and prospective clients our results of operations may suffer further a client may choose to use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm to perform the types of services we provide we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain our current levels of profitability or growth in the face of competitive pressures including competition for skilled technology professionals and pricing pressure from competitors employing an onsiteoffshore business model 

in addition we may face competition from companies that increase in size or scope as the result of strategic mergers or acquisitions these transactions may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers software companies and vendors and service providers the result of any such vertical integration may be greater integration of products and services that were once offered separately by independent vendors our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of such an industry trend which could adversely affect our competitive position 

  

we may not be able to sustain our current level of profitability 

for the year ended december 31 2010 we reported an operating margin of 188 our operating margin may decline if we experience declines in demand and pricing for our services imposition of new nonincome related taxes or due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition historically wages in india increased at a faster rate than in the united states additionally the number and type of equitybased compensation awards and the assumptions used in valuing equitybased compensation awards may change resulting in increased stockbased compensation expense and lower margins although we have historically been able to partially offset wage increases and foreign currency fluctuations through further leveraging the scale of our operating structure obtaining price increases and issuing a lower number of stockbased compensation awards in proportion to our overall headcount we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to control our costs 

our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency affects our profitability if we are unable to control our costs or improve our efficiency our profitability could be negatively affected 

our business will suffer if we fail to develop new services and enhance our existing services in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological environment 

the information technology consulting and business process outsourcing professional services markets are characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions our future success will depend on our ability to develop solutions that keep pace with changes in the markets in which we provide services we cannot be sure that we will be successful in developing new services addressing evolving technologies in a timely or costeffective manner or if these services are developed that we will be successful in the marketplace in addition we cannot be sure that products services or technologies developed by others will not render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to address the demands of the rapidly evolving technological environment could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to remain competitive will also depend on our ability to design and implement in a timely and costeffective manner solutions for customers that both leverage their legacy systems and appropriately utilize newer technologies such as web 20 models softwareasaservice and service oriented architectures our failure to design and implement solutions in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may face difficulties in providing endtoend business solutions for our clients that could cause clients to discontinue their work with us which in turn could harm our business 

we have been expanding the nature and scope of our engagements and have added new service offerings such as it consulting business and knowledge process outsourcing systems integration and outsourcing of entire portions of it infrastructure the success of these service offerings is dependent in part upon continued demand for such services by our existing new and prospective clients and our ability to meet this demand in a costcompetitive and effective manner in addition our ability to effectively offer a wider breadth of endtoend business solutions depends on our ability to attract existing or new clients to these service offerings to obtain engagements for such endtoend solutions we also are more likely to compete with large wellestablished international consulting firms resulting in increased competition and marketing costs accordingly we cannot be certain that our new service offerings will effectively meet client needs or that we will be able to attract existing and new clients to these service offerings 

the increased breadth of our service offerings may result in larger and more complex projects with our clients this will require us to establish closer relationships with our clients and a thorough understanding of their 

  

operations our ability to establish such relationships will depend on a number of factors including the proficiency of our professionals and our management personnel our failure to understand our client requirements or our failure to deliver services that meet the requirements specified by our clients could result in termination of client contracts and we could be liable to our clients for significant penalties or damages 

larger projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements these terminations cancellations or delays may result from factors that have little or nothing to do with the quality of our services such as the business or financial condition of our clients or the economy generally such cancellations or delays make it difficult to plan for project resource requirements and inaccuracies in such resource planning and allocation may have a negative impact on our profitability 

if our clients are not satisfied with our services our business could be adversely affected 

our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing clients our business model also depends on relationships our account teams develop with our clients so that we can understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to those needs if a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client in particular clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors in addition negative publicity related to our client services or relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients 

we rely on a few customers for a large portion of our revenues 

our top five customers generated approximately 179 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a major customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year the loss of one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we generally do not have longterm contracts with our customers and our results of operations could be adversely affected if our clients terminate their contracts with us on short notice 

consistent with industry practice we generally do not enter into longterm contracts with our customers a majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice and without significant early termination cost terminations may result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project including the business or financial conditions of the client changes in ownership or management at our clients changes in client strategies or the economy or markets generally when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to eliminate our associated costs in a timely manner consequently our profit margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected if we are unable to replace the lost revenue with other work on terms we find acceptable or effectively eliminate costs we may not be able to maintain our level of profitability 

our results of operations may be affected by the rate of growth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of technology spending by our clients 

our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients as well as their customers and suppliers in challenging economic environments our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities at the same time many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and 

  

exchanging information and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel processes and infrastructures if the growth of technology usage in business or our clients’ spending on technology in business declines or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new technological solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our clients our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions such as the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system could also result in financial difficulties including limited access to the credit markets insolvency or bankruptcy for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

we are investing substantial cash in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately 

we have made and continue to make significant contractual commitments related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our development and delivery centers we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability may be reduced 

competition for highlyskilled technical personnel is intense and the success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled professionals 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highlyskilled professionals so as to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in particular we must attract train and retain appropriate numbers of talented people including project managers it engineers and other senior technical personnel with diverse skills in order to serve client needs and grow our business we are particularly dependent on retaining our senior executives and other experienced managers with the skill sets required by our business and if we are unable to do so our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized similarly the profitability of our business model depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to support our projects the processes and costs associated with recruiting training and retaining employees place significant demands on our resources 

we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for professionals with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer we have subcontracted to a limited extent in the past and may do so in the future with other service providers in order to meet our obligations to our customers our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend in large part on our ability to attract train and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences further we must train and manage our growing work force requiring an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new 

  

management personnel we cannot guarantee that the management skills and systems currently in place will be adequate or that we will be able to train and assimilate new employees successfully our profits and ability to compete for and manage client engagements could be adversely affected if we cannot manage employee hiring and attrition to achieve a stable and efficient workforce structure 

our ability to operate and compete effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel or if we cannot attract additional qualified personnel 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of the key members of our management team as well as marketing sales and technical personnel and our ability to attract and retain new management and other personnel we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or significant employees competition for personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting and retaining new personnel in the future the loss of any one or more of our key personnel or the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

restrictions in noncompetition agreements with our executive officers may not be enforceable 

we have entered into noncompetition agreements with our executive officers we cannot be certain however that the restrictions in these agreements prohibiting such executive officers from engaging in competitive activities are enforceable further substantially all of our professional nonexecutive staff are not covered by agreements that would prohibit them from working for our competitors if any of our key professional personnel leaves our employment and joins one of our competitors our business could be adversely affected 

our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate earnings in india or if such earnings become subject to us tax on a current basis 

effective january 1 2002 and in accordance with authoritative literature we no longer accrue incremental us taxes on all indian earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these earnings as well as other foreign earnings for all periods are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur in the future that could effectively force us to change our intent not to repatriate our foreign earnings if we change our intent and repatriate such earnings we will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than our effective income tax rate in 2010 these increased taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results may be negatively impacted upon the loss of certain tax benefits provided by india to companies in our industry as well as from proposed tax legislation in india 

our indian subsidiaries are exportoriented companies which under the indian income tax act of 1961 are entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each software technology park or stp with respect to export profits for each stp substantially all of the earnings of our indian subsidiaries are attributable to export profits the majority of our stps in india are currently entitled to a 100 exemption from indian income tax under current indian tax law export profits after march 31 2011 from our existing stps will be fully taxable at the indian statutory rate which is currently 3322 in effect at such time if the tax holidays relating to our indian stps are not extended or new tax incentives are not introduced that would effectively extend the income tax holiday benefits beyond march 31 2011 our effective income tax rate will increase significantly beginning in calendar year 2011 

  

if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions we predominantly contract to provide services either on a timeandmaterials or on a fixedprice basis our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations and utilizing workforces with different skill sets and competencies across geographically diverse service locations our pricing cost and profit margin estimates for the work that we perform frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract there is a risk that we will underprice our projects fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our profit margin 

in addition a significant portion of our projects are on a fixedprice basis subjecting us to the foregoing risks to an even greater extent fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 315 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 we expect that an increasing number of our future projects will be contracted on a fixedprice basis in addition to the other risks described in the paragraph above we bear the risk of cost overruns and operating cost inflation in connection with projects covered by fixedprice contracts our failure to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a fixedprice project or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within the time frame committed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing rates 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to recover for our services if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our profit margin and our profitability could suffer the rates we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable utilization rates 

the cost of providing our services including the utilization rate of our professionals affects our profitability if we are not able to maintain an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals our profit margin and our profitability may suffer our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

 if we do not continue to improve our operational financial and other internal controls and systems to manage our rapid growth and size or if we are unable to enter operate and compete effectively in new geographic markets our business may suffer and the value of our shareholders’ investment may be harmed 

our anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources our growth will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls both in the united states india and elsewhere in particular our continued growth will increase the challenges involved in 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the increasing size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that an employee will engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train our people and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired 

as part of our growth strategy we plan to continue expanding our operations in europe asia middle east and latin america we may not be able to compete effectively in these markets and the cost of entering these markets may be substantially greater than we expect if we fail to compete effectively in the new markets we enter or if the cost of entering those markets is substantially greater than we expect our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we cannot compete effectively we may be required to reconsider our strategy to invest in our international expansion plans and change our intent on the repatriation of our earnings 

  

our operating results may experience significant quarterly fluctuations 

we historically have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations and expect these fluctuations to continue among the factors causing these variations have been 

 

  

  

  

 in addition our future revenues operating margins and profitability may fluctuate as a result of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a high percentage of our operating expenses particularly personnel and rent are relatively fixed in advance of any particular period as a result unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects or in employee wage levels and utilization rates may cause significant variations in our operating results in any particular period and could result in losses any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations any material reduction in utilization rates for our professional staff or variance in the onsiteoffshore staffing mix an unanticipated termination of a major project a customer’s decision not to pursue a new project or proceed to succeeding stages of a current project or the completion of several major customer projects during a quarter could require us to pay underutilized employees and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as a result of these factors it is possible that in some future periods our revenues and operating results may be significantly below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such an event the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 

we could be held liable for damages or our reputation could be damaged by disclosure of confidential information or personal data or system failures 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information in addition many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for 

  

the failure although we attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our services we cannot assure you that any contractual limitations on liability will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages 

in addition we often have access to or are required to manage utilize collect and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data including nonpublic personal data as a result we are subject to numerous us and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant liability to our clients or our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws as well as liability and penalties in connection with any violation of applicable privacy laws andor criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through breach of computer systems systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation or otherwise could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop or manage for our clients whether by our employees or third parties could result in negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation 

although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be sufficient in amount to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability including with respect to our indemnification obligations in connection with providing our solutions and services 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our clients we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines in addition the contracting practices of our competitors may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become standard in the marketplace if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope andor amount of our potential liability if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide solutions and services and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements we might face significant legal liability and our business could be adversely affected 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients or other parties with whom we conduct business with respect to certain matters these arrangements can include provisions whereby we agree to hold the indemnified party and certain of their affiliated entities harmless with respect to thirdparty claims related to such matters as our breach of certain representations or covenants or out of our intellectual property infringement our gross negligence or willful misconduct or certain other claims made against certain parties payments by us under any of these arrangements are generally conditioned on the client making a claim and providing us with full control over the defense and settlement of such claim it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically we have not made payments under these indemnification agreements so they have not had any impact on our operating results financial position or cash flows however if events arise requiring us to make payment for indemnification claims under our indemnification obligations in contracts we have entered such payments could have material impact on our operating results financial position and cash flows 

  

we could incur liability or our reputation could be damaged if our provision of services and solutions to our clients contributes to our clients’ internal control deficiencies 

our clients may perform audits or require us to perform audits and provide audit reports with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such clients especially when we process data belonging to them our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit in a timely manner additionally we could incur liability if our controls and procedures or the controls and procedures we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures or impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our business may be adversely affected 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property we presently hold no patents or registered copyrights and rely upon a combination of copyright and trade secret laws nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and various security measures to protect our intellectual property rights existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions such as china might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights india is a member of the berne convention and has agreed to recognize protections on copyrights conferred under the laws of foreign countries including the laws of the united states we believe that laws rules regulations and treaties in effect in the united states india and other countries in which we operate are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our copyrights and other intellectual property however there can be no assurance that these laws will not change and in particular that the laws of india or the united states will not change in ways that may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components libraries and toolsets from india to the united states or from the united states to india there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of any of our intellectual property or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in development of technology products or services that compete with our products and services and unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products services or proprietary information if we are unable to protect our intellectual property our business may be adversely affected 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed or used in connection with a contract than we generally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create and intend to reuse across multiple client engagements which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and we could have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients these claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions in a number of our contracts we have agreed to indemnify our clients for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area whether we ultimately win or lose could be timeconsuming and costly injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements if the latter we might not be able to enter into these royalty or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms if a claim of infringement were 

  

successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages we expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our competitors are able to obtain patents for software products and processes any infringement claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we could lose our ability or be unable to secure the right to utilize the intellectual property of others thirdparty suppliers of software hardware or other intellectual assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired our operating results could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to integrate acquired companies or technologies successfully and we may be subject to certain liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions that could harm our operating results 

we expect to continue our program of pursuing strategic acquisitions and joint ventures designed to enhance our capabilities enable us to expand our geographic presence especially in the european market enter new technology areas andor expand our capacity we cannot be sure that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates consummate any acquisition or joint venture integrate any acquired business or joint venture into our operations or achieve desired financial and operating results further acquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention and failure to retain key personnel we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources to complete the transactions our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses or technologies into our ongoing operations and assimilate employees of those businesses into our culture and operations accordingly we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition we undertake if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services also we may finance any future acquisitions with cash debt financing the issuance of equity securities or a combination of the foregoing we cannot assure you that we will be able to arrange adequate financing on acceptable terms in addition acquisitions financed with the issuance of our equity securities could be dilutive 

although we conduct due diligence in connection with each of our acquisitions there may be liabilities that we fail to discover or that we inadequately assess in our due diligence efforts in particular to the extent that any acquired businesses or properties failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations or failed to fulfill their contractual obligations to customers we as the successor owner may be financially responsible for these violations and failures and may suffer reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected while we generally require the selling party to indemnify us for any and all damages associated with such liabilities if for any reason the seller does not perform their indemnification obligation we may be held responsible for such liabilities and have no recourse for resulting damages in addition as part of an acquisition we may assume responsibilities and obligations of the acquired business pursuant to the terms and conditions of services agreements entered by the acquired entity that are not consistent with the terms and conditions that we typically accept and require although we attempt to structure acquisitions in such a manner as to minimize the liability that could arise from such contractual commitments we cannot assure you that any of our efforts to minimize the liability will be effective in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages under such agreements the discovery of any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions for which we are unable to receive indemnification could harm our operating results 

system failure or disruptions in communications could disrupt our business and result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

to deliver our services to our customers we must maintain a high speed network of satellite fiber optic and land lines and active voice and data communications twentyfour hours a day between our main operating offices in chennai our other development and delivery centers and the offices of our customers worldwide although 

  

we maintain redundancy facilities and satellite communications links any systems failure or a significant lapse in our ability to transmit voice and data through satellite and telephone communications could result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting systems integration and technology or outsourcing services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

our ability to attract and retain business may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors since many of our specific client engagements involve unique services and solutions our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our clients’ evaluation of whether to engage our services we believe the cognizant brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former clients competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about our company even if based on false rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business in particular damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the cognizant brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us adversely affecting our share price 

provisions in our charter bylaws and stockholders’ rights plan and provisions under delaware law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals 

provisions in our charter and bylaws each as amended our stockholders’ rights plan and delaware general corporate law or dgcl may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover proposals or delaying or preventing changes in our control or management including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over thencurrent market prices in addition these documents and provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests our board of directors has the authority without further action by the stockholders to fix the rights and preferences and issue shares of preferred stock our charter provides for a classified board of directors which will prevent a change of control of our board of directors at a single meeting of stockholders the prohibition of our stockholders’ ability to act by written consent and to call a special meeting will delay stockholder actions until annual meetings or until a special meeting is called by our chairman or chief executive officer or our board of directors the supermajorityvoting requirement for specified amendments to our charter and bylaws allows a minority of our stockholders to block those amendments the dgcl also contains provisions preventing stockholders from engaging in business combinations with us subject to certain exceptions these provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock 

new and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements add uncertainty to our compliance policies and increases our costs of compliance 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to accounting corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 other sec regulations and the nasdaq global select market rules are creating uncertainty for companies like ours these laws regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new 

  

guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such corporate governance standards 

in particular our efforts to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors’ audit of that assessment requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources we consistently assess the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting remediate any control deficiencies that may be identified and validate through testing that our controls are functioning as documented while we do not anticipate any material weaknesses the inability of management and our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy and effectiveness respectively of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure and our efforts to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities in addition the laws regulations and standards regarding corporate governance may make it more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with their performance of duties as a result we may face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which could harm our business if we fail to comply with new or changed laws regulations or standards of corporate governance our business and reputation may be harmed 

our share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls to ensure the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis or be unable to properly report on our business and the results of our operations and the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected 

we are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio 

recent turmoil in the financial markets has adversely affected economic activity in the united states and other regions of the world in which we do business we believe that based on our current cash cash equivalents and investment balances and expected operating cash flows the current lack of liquidity in the credit markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity cash flow or financial flexibility continued deterioration of the credit and capital markets could result in volatility of our investment earnings and impairments to our investment portfolio which could negatively impact our financial condition and reported income the continued decline in economic activity could adversely affect the ability of counterparties to certain financial instruments such as marketable securities and derivatives to meet their obligations to us 

our stock price continues to be volatile 

our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global 

  

economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive summary 

in 2010 our revenues increased to 45924 million compared to 32787 million in 2009 net income increased to 7335 million or 237 per diluted share including stockbased compensation expense net of tax equal to 014 per diluted share during 2010 this is compared to net income of 5350 million or 178 per diluted share including stockbased compensation expense and applicable stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense net of tax of 012 per diluted share during 2009 the key drivers of our revenue growth in 2010 were as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we saw a continued increase in demand from our customers for a broad range of it solutions including application maintenance complex systems development engagements testing enterprise resource planning or erp infrastructure management business process outsourcing or bpo and business intelligence we finished the year with approximately 712 active clients compared to approximately 589 as of december 31 2009 and increased the number of strategic clients by 22 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 166 we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate at least 5 million to 50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity our top five and top ten customers accounted for 179 and 303 respectively of our total revenues in 2010 as compared to 174 and 294 respectively for the year ended december 31 2009 as we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to decline over time 

our revenue from european customers increased by 410 to approximately 8556 million in 2010 compared to approximately 6068 million in 2009 revenue from europe excluding the uk increased by approximately 430 million from approximately 2533 million in 2009 to approximately 2963 million in 2010 and revenue from the uk increased by approximately 2058 million from approximately 3535 million in 2009 to approximately 5593 million in 2010 we believe that europe will continue to be an area of significant investment for us as we see this region as well as the middle east and the asia pacific regions particularly japan india australia and singapore as growth opportunities for the long term 

our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of and strong demand for offshore it software and services and business process outsourcing nasscom india’s national association of software and service companies reports indicate that india’s it software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to exceed 76 billion at the end of nasscom’s fiscal year 2011 this is an expected growth rate of approximately 19 over the prior fiscal year according to the latest nasscom “perspective 2020 transform business transform india” report global changes and new megatrends within economic demographic business social and environmental areas are set to expand the outsourcing industry by creating new dynamics and opportunities and are expected to result in export revenues of 175 billion by 2020 

  

in 2010 our operating margin decreased slightly to 188 compared to 189 in 2009 excluding stockbased compensation expense of approximately 570 million operating margin in 2010 was 200 this was in line with our historic targeted operating margin range excluding stockbased compensation costs and applicable stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 19 to 20 of total revenues operating margin was affected by the appreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar an increase in compensation costs including incentivebased compensation costs and investments to grow our business partially offset by expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization historically we have invested our profitability above the 19 to 20 operating margin level which excludes stockbased compensation and any related stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense back into our business which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth this investment is primarily focused in the areas of hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise training our technical staff in a broader range of service offerings strengthening our business analytic capabilities strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery and recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees in addition this investment includes maintaining a level of resources trained in a broad range of service offerings to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects for the year ending december 31 2011 we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our targeted operating margin levels back into the business 

we finished the year with total headcount of approximately 104000 which is an increase of approximately 25600 over the prior year the increase in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs to meet the demand for our services is the primary driver of the increase in our operating expenses in 2010 annualized turnover including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 185 for 2010 the majority of our turnover occurs in india as a result annualized attrition rates onsite at clients are below our global attrition rate in addition attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation costs in india which may continue in the future however historically this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies 

our current india real estate development program includes planned construction of an additional 80 million square feet of new space the expanded program includes the expenditure of approximately 5000 million between 2011 and the end of 2014 on land acquisition facilities construction and furnishings to build new companyowned stateoftheart it development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as special economic zones or sezs located in india during 2011 we expect to spend approximately 285 million globally for capital expenditures 

at december 31 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 22264 million and working capital of 25875 million accordingly we do not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues during 2010 and 2009 we repurchased 419 million and 124 million respectively of our class a common stock under various stock repurchase programs stock repurchases under these programs were funded from working capital 

while several measures have indicated that the economy may be improving the global economic environment remains fragile during 2011 we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results

 critical accounting estimates and risks 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixedbid contracts the allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes valuation of short and longterm investments goodwill and other longlived assets assumptions used in valuing stockbased compensation awards and derivative financial investments contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts which are predominantly fixedprice contracts are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting under this method total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost cost to cost method this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the 

  

estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations contract losses for the periods presented were immaterial 

stockbased compensation  utilizing the fair value recognition provisions prescribed by the authoritative guidance stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised the expected volatility of our stock and the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited in addition for performance stock units we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period if actual results differ significantly from our estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance if any involves judgment as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related net interest tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred income tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would reduce income in the period such determination was made 

our indian subsidiaries which are referred to collectively herein as cognizant india are exportoriented companies which under the indian income tax act of 1961 are entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each software technology park or stp with respect to export profits for each stp substantially all of the earnings of cognizant india are attributable to export profits the majority of our stps in india are currently entitled to a 100 exemption from indian income tax in addition we have constructed our newer development facilities in sezs which are entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years we expect to continue to locate most of our new development centers in these areas 

the tax holidays for stps are currently scheduled to expire on march 31 2011 thereafter export profits from our existing stps will be fully taxable at the indian statutory rate 3322 as of december 31 2010 in effect at such time if the tax holidays relating to our indian stps are not extended or new tax incentives are not introduced that would effectively extend the income tax holiday benefits beyond march 2011 our effective income tax rate will increase significantly beginning in calendar year 2011 

  

derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that each derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date our derivative financial instruments consist of foreign exchange forward contracts we estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange forward contract by using a present value of expected cash flows model this model utilizes various assumptions including but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows discount rates and credit risk factors the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

investments  our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of us dollar denominated corporate bonds municipal bonds debt issuances by the us government us government agencies foreign governments and supranational entities assetbacked securities and bank time deposits the assetbacked securities include securities backed by auto loans credit card receivables and other receivables and are rated aaaaaa the years of issuance of our assetbacked securities fall in the 2001 to 2010 range historically our investments have also included municipal debt securities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction process 

we utilize various inputs to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio to the extent they exist unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets level 1 or quoted prices on similar assets level 2 are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in the absence of quoted prices or liquid markets valuation techniques would be used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable level 3 valuation techniques are based on various assumptions including but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows discount rates rate of return and adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity a significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using level 3 inputs the use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition see note 10 for additional information related to our security valuation methodologies 

we periodically evaluate if unrealized losses as determined based on the security valuation methodologies discussed above on individual securities classified as available for sale in the investment portfolio are considered to be otherthantemporary the analysis of otherthantemporary impairment requires the use of various assumptions including but not limited to the length of time an investment’s book value is greater than fair value the severity of the investment’s decline any credit deterioration of the investment whether management intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is generally recorded to earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative creditworthiness of each customer historical collections experience and other information including the aging of the receivables if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant when determining the fair value of our reporting units we utilize various assumptions including projections of future cash flows any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge based upon our most recent evaluation of goodwill there are no significant risks of impairment as of december 31 2010 our goodwill balance was 2240 million 

longlived assets  we review longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in general we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future 

  

cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset if such assets were determined to be impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks the majority of our development and delivery centers including a majority of our employees are located in india as a result we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights limitations on immigration programs the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potential geopolitical and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts and potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers we are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the inability of our management to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline see part i item 1a “risk factors” 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data expressed for the three years ended december 31 2010 

dollars in thousands 

 

  

  the following table includes nongaap income from operations excluding stockbased compensation and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense a measure defined by the securities and exchange commission as a nongaap financial measure this nongaap financial measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies in addition this nongaap measure the financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and reconciliations of our gaap financial statements to such nongaap measure should be carefully evaluated 

we seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin excluding stockbased compensation expense and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 19 to 20 of revenues accordingly we believe that nongaap income from operations excluding stockbased compensation expense and applicable stockbased indian fringe benefit tax which was repealed during the third quarter of 2009 retroactive to april 1 2009 is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes we use financial statements that do not include stockbased compensation expense and applicable stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors moreover because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use to account for stockbased compensation expense we believe that providing a nongaap financial measure that excludes stockbased compensation expense and applicable stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of 

  

other companies accordingly we believe that the presentation of nongaap income from operations when read in conjunction with our reported gaap income from operations can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 

a limitation of using nongaap income from operations versus income from operations reported in accordance with gaap is that nongaap income from operations excludes costs namely stockbased compensation that is recurring and applicable stockbased indian fringe benefit tax stockbased compensation expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business in addition other companies may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than us thereby limiting the usefulness of this nongaap financial measure as a comparative tool we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from nongaap income from operations and evaluating such nongaap financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap 

a reconciliation of income from operations as reported and nongaap income from operations excluding stockbased compensation expense and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense is as follows for the years ended december 31 

dollars in thousands 

 

 the fringe benefit tax regulation in india obligated us to pay upon exercise or distribution of shares under a stockbased compensation award a nonincome related tax on the appreciation of the award from date of grant to date of vest there was no cash cost to us as we recovered the cost of the indian fringe benefit tax from the employee’s proceeds from the award under us gaap the stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense is required to be recorded as an operating expense and the related recovery of such tax from our employee is required to be recorded to stockholders’ equity as proceeds from a stockbased compensation award during the third quarter of 2009 the indian government repealed the fringe benefit tax retroactive to april 1 2009 

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

revenue  revenue increased by 401 or approximately 13137 million from approximately 32787 million during 2009 to approximately 45924 million in 2010 this increase was primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the global delivery model among an increasing number of industries continued interest in using the global delivery model as a means to reduce overall it costs increased customer spending on postacquisition integration engagements and discretionary development projects and greater penetration in the european market revenue from customers existing as of december 31 2009 increased by approximately 11933 million and revenue from new customers added during 2010 was approximately 1204 million or approximately 92 of the year over year revenue increase and 26 of total revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 in addition revenue from our north american and european customers increased in 2010 by 9885 million and 2488 million respectively as compared to 2009 we had approximately 712 active 

  

clients as of december 31 2010 as compared to approximately 589 active clients as of december 31 2009 in addition we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services our financial services and healthcare business segments accounted for approximately 5378 million and 3167 million respectively of the 13137 million increase in revenue additionally our it consulting and technology services and it outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 521 and 304 respectively compared to 2009 and represented approximately 483 and 517 respectively of total revenues in 2010 no customer accounted for sales in excess of 10 of revenues during 2010 and 2009 

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense  our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries incentivebased compensation stockbased compensation expense payroll taxes benefits immigration and projectrelated travel for technical personnel subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues our cost of revenues increased by approximately 435 or 8052 million from 18494 million during 2009 to 26546 million in 2010 the increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits costs of approximately 6712 million resulting from the increase in the number of our technical personnel and incentivebased compensation as well as the appreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries incentivebased compensation stockbased compensation expense payroll taxes employee benefits travel promotion communications management finance administrative and occupancy costs selling general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization increased by approximately 327 or 2652 million from 8107 million during 2009 to 10759 million during 2010 and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 247 in 2009 to 234 in 2010 the decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to economies of scale driven by increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation and the impact of the appreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar 

income from operations  income from operations increased approximately 393 or 2434 million from approximately 6185 million during 2009 to approximately 8619 million during 2010 representing operating margins of 188 of revenues in 2010 and 189 of revenues in 2009 the operating margin was impacted by an increase in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation costs and investments to grow our business partially offset by expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges the appreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately 157 basis points or 157 percentage points each additional 10 change in the exchange rate between the indian rupee and the us dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 27 basis points or 027 percentage points excluding stockbased compensation expense of 570 million and 448 million for 2010 and 2009 and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 09 million in 2009 operating margins for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 were 200 and 203 respectively 

we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain salary payments in india these hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the indian rupee during 2010 settlement of certain cash flow hedges favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 91 basis points or 091 percentage points 

  

other income expense net  total other income expense net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses and interest income the following table sets forth for the periods indicated total other income expense net 

dollars in thousands 

 

 the foreign currency exchange gains of approximately 112 million were primarily attributed to intercompany transactions between our european subsidiaries and cognizant india for services performed by cognizant india on behalf of our european customers and the remeasurement of the indian rupee net monetary assets on cognizant india’s books to the us dollar functional currency the 211 million of losses on foreign exchange forward contracts were related to the change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to indian rupee denominated net monetary assets and the realized losses related to the settlement of certain foreign exchange forward contracts in 2010 at december 31 2010 the notional value of these undesignated hedges was 2340 million the 99 million increase in interest income was primarily attributed to higher invested balances

net income  net income increased from approximately 5350 million in 2009 to approximately 7335 million in 2010 representing 163 and 160 of revenues respectively the decrease in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2010 is primarily attributed to an increase in net foreign currency exchange losses and a higher effective income tax rate 

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

revenue  revenue increased by 164 or approximately 4624 million from approximately 28163 million during 2008 to approximately 32787 million in 2009 this increase was primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the global delivery model among an increasing number of industries continued interest in using the global delivery model as a means to reduce overall it costs and greater penetration in the european market revenue from customers existing as of december 31 2008 increased by approximately 3759 million and revenue from new customers added during 2009 was approximately 865 million or approximately 187 of the year over year revenue increase and 26 of total revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 in addition revenue from our north american and european customers increased in 2009 by 3659 million and 657 million respectively as compared to 2008 we had approximately 589 active clients as of december 31 2009 as compared to approximately 565 active clients as of december 31 2008 in addition we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services our financial services and healthcare business segments accounted for approximately 1226 million and 1722 million respectively of the 4624 million increase in revenue additionally our it consulting and technology services and it outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 102 and 219 respectively compared to 2008 and represented approximately 444 and 556 respectively of total revenues in 2009

other income expense net total other income expense net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses and interest income the following table sets forth for the periods indicated total other income expense net 

dollars in thousands 

 

 in 2009 foreign currency exchange gains were approximately 225 million which were primarily attributed to us dollar denominated intercompany payables from our european subsidiaries to cognizant india for services performed by cognizant india on behalf of our european customers and the remeasurement of the indian rupee net monetary assets on cognizant india’s books to the us dollar functional currency the 208 million of losses on foreign exchange forward contracts were related to the change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to indian rupee denominated net monetary assets at december 31 2009 the notional value of these undesignated hedges was 4000 million the 63 million decrease in interest income was due to lower average shortterm interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008 the increase in other net of 17 million primarily related to gains on redemptions of certain auctionrate securities offset by the net change in fair value of our auctionrate securities and the related ubs right 

provision for income taxes  the provision for income taxes increased from approximately 844 million in 2008 to approximately 1020 million in 2009 the effective income tax rate decreased from 164 in 2008 to 160 in 2009 the decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily attributed to the tax impact of foreign exchange forward contracts as well as a shift in the geographic mix of our income which resulted in a greater percentage of our revenues falling under income tax holidays 

net income  net income increased from approximately 4308 million in 2008 to approximately 5350 million in 2009 representing 153 and 163 of revenues respectively the increase in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2009 was primarily attributed to a higher operating margin and foreign currency exchange gains partially offset by lower interest income 

results by business segment 

our reportable segments are financial services which includes customers providing banking  transaction processing capital markets and insurance services healthcare which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers manufacturingretaillogistics which includes manufacturers retailers travel and other hospitality customers as well as customers providing logistics services and other which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which individually are less than 100 of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit the other segment includes entertainment media and information services communications and high technology operating segments our sales managers account executives account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve 

our chief operating decision maker evaluates cognizant’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before 

  

unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development and delivery centers certain expenses such as general and administrative and a portion of depreciation and amortization are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment further stockbased compensation expense and the related stockbased indian fringe benefit tax are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as “unallocated” and are adjusted only against the total income from operations 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 712 active customers accordingly we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment however no individual customer exceeded 100 of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues 

revenues from external customers and segment operating profit before unallocated expenses for the financial services healthcare manufacturingretaillogistics and other segments for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 are as follows 

 

 year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

financial services segment 

revenue revenue increased by 382 or approximately 5378 million from approximately 14066 million during 2009 to approximately 19445 million in 2010 the increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers the increase in revenue from customers existing as of december 31 2009 and customers added 

  

during 2010 was approximately 5081 million and approximately 297 million respectively within the segment revenue from our banking and insurance customers increased approximately 4103 million and 1275 million respectively over the prior year overall the full year 2010 increase in the segment can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of our global services delivery model and increased customer spending on postacquisition integration engagements and discretionary development projects

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 22264 million we have used and plan to use such cash for expansion of existing operations including our offshore development and delivery centers continued development of new service lines possible acquisitions of related businesses formation of joint ventures stock repurchases and general corporate purposes including working capital as of december 31 2010 we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately 25875 million as compared to working capital of approximately 16610 million as of december 31 2009 accordingly we do not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues 

net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 7647 million for the year ended december 31 2010 6723 million for the year ended december 31 2009 and 4297 million for the year ended 

  

december 31 2008 the increase in 2010 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2010 and higher incentive based compensation accruals which are paid subsequent to year end this increase was offset by increases in certain accounts including trade accounts receivable which increased from approximately 5175 million at december 31 2008 to approximately 6263 million at december 31 2009 and to approximately 9013 million at december 31 2010 unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately 622 million at december 31 2008 to approximately 830 at december 31 2009 and to approximately 1130 million at december 31 2010 the increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2010 was due primarily to increased revenues we monitor turnover aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff at december 31 2010 our days sales outstanding including unbilled receivables was approximately 71 days as compared to 72 days as of december 31 2009 and 71 days as of december 31 2008 

our investing activities used net cash of approximately 4469 million for the year ended december 31 2010 3948 million for the year ended december 31 2009 and 550 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2010 primarily related to an increase in capital expenditures during the year partially offset by decreased payments for acquisitions and a decrease in net purchases of investments 

our financing activities provided net cash of approximately 1200 million for the year ended december 31 2010 769 million for the year ended december 31 2009 and 440 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in 2010 related to additional proceeds and excess tax benefits from issuances under our stockbased compensation plans partially offset by additional repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program 

as of december 31 2010 our shortterm investments totaled 6854 million in the second quarter of 2010 our auctionrate municipal debt securities were redeemed by the issuers or purchased by ubs reducing our outstanding balance to zero 

our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our longterm capital requirements beyond a twelve month period will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock our continued intent not to repatriate foreign earnings and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we cannot be certain that additional financing if required will be available on terms favorable to us if at all we expect our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months 

commitments and contingencies 

as of december 31 2010 we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately 566 million related to our india development center expansion program which included expenditures for land acquisition facilities construction and furnishings to build new stateoftheart development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as sezs located in india as of december 31 2010 we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

   

 

  as of december 31 2010 we had 230 million of unrecognized tax benefits this represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution the resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management the outcome of such claims and legal actions if decided adversely is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results cash flows or consolidated financial position additionally many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our clients including any breach involving a customer’s confidential information or sensitive data or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our services there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results financial position and cash flows 

foreign currency risk 

overall we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as approximately 780 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 were generated from customers located in north america however a portion of our costs in india representing approximately 332 of our global operating costs for the year ended december 31 2010 are denominated in the indian rupee and are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations in addition a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may result in nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement in 2010 and 2009 we reported foreign currency exchange gains exclusive of hedging gains or losses of approximately 112 million and 225 million respectively which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of intercompany balances between our european subsidiaries and cognizant india for services performed by cognizant india on behalf of our european customers and indian rupee net monetary assets on cognizant india’s books to the us dollar functional currency on an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the indian rupee in our indian subsidiaries 

we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses including salaries these us dollar  indian rupee hedges to buy indian rupees and sell us dollars are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs during 2010 and 2009 we reported income of 416 million and 89 million respectively on 

  

contracts that settled during each year as of december 31 2010 we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of 7800 million and weighted average forward rate of 4801 rupees to the us dollar scheduled to mature in 2011 outstanding contracts with a notional value of 7800 million and weighted average forward rate of 4810 rupees to the us dollar scheduled to mature in 2012 and outstanding contracts with a notional value of 6000 million and a weighted average forward rate of 5007 rupees to the us dollar scheduled to mature in 2013 

we also use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to our indian rupee denominated net monetary assets these contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange rate gains or losses upon the remeasurement of the underlying indian rupee denominated net monetary assets during 2009 we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2010 to buy us dollars and sell indian rupees during 2010 during 2010 we entered into additional foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2011 at december 31 2010 and 2009 the notional value of the outstanding contracts was 2340 million and 400 million respectively and the related fair values were a liability of 73 million and 208 million respectively during 2010 and 2009 inclusive of losses of 211 million and 208 million respectively on these undesignated balance sheet hedges we reported net foreign currency exchange losses and gains of approximately 99 million and 17 million respectively 

there were no offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2010 2009 and 2008 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources 

effects of inflation 

our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals competition in india the united states and europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation as with other service providers in our industry we must adequately anticipate wage increases particularly on our fixedprice contracts historically we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation in india however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future 

recent accounting pronouncements

in december 2010 the fasb issued a new accounting standard requiring that step 2 of the goodwill impairment test be performed for reporting units whose carrying value is zero or negative this guidance will be effective january 1 2011 our adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations 

in december 2010 the fasb issued new guidance clarifying some of the disclosure requirements related to business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis specifically the guidance states that if comparative financial statements are presented the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combinations that occurred during the current year occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only additionally the new standard expands the supplemental pro forma disclosure required by the authoritative guidance to include a description of the nature and amount of material nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings this guidance will be effective january 1 2011 our adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations however it may result in additional disclosures in the event that we enter into a business combination that is material either on an individual or aggregate basis

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses including salaries these us dollar  indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs as of december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 the notional value of these contracts was 21600 million and 8100 million respectively the outstanding contracts as of december 31 2010 are scheduled to mature each month during 2011 2012 and 2013 at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 the net unrealized gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was 323 million and 190 million respectively based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2010 which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 2053 million

additionally in order to respond effectively to a changing and challenging business environment it departments of many companies have focused increasingly on improving returns on it investments lowering costs and accelerating the delivery of new systems and solutions to accomplish these objectives many it departments have shifted all or a portion of their it development integration and maintenance requirements to outside service providers operating with global sourcing models 

  

global demand for high quality lower cost it services from outside providers has created a significant opportunity for it service providers that can successfully leverage the benefits of and address the challenges in using a global talent pool the effective use of personnel from across the globe can offer a variety of benefits including lower costs faster delivery of new it solutions and innovations in vertical solutions processes and technologies certain countries particularly india and china have large talent pools of highly qualified technical professionals who can provide high quality it and business and knowledge process outsourcing services at a lower cost india is a leader in it services and is regarded as having one of the largest and highest quality pools of talent in the world historically it service providers have used offshore labor pools primarily to supplement the internal staffing needs of customers however evolving customer demands have led to the increasing acceptance and use of offshore resources for higher valueadded services these services include application design development testing integration and maintenance as well as technology consulting and infrastructure management india’s services and software exports continue to see significant growth recent nasscom india’s national association of software and service companies reports state that india’s it software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to reach an estimated 50 billion by the end of nasscom’s fiscal year march 31 2010 this is an expected growth rate of approximately 55 over the prior fiscal year additionally the fy 201011 outlook for these sectors expects revenue growth of approximately 13 to 15 according to the latest nasscom “perspective 2020 transform business transform india” report global changes and new megatrends within economic demographic business social and environmental areas are set to expand the outsourcing industry by creating new dynamics and opportunities and are expected to result in export revenues of approximately 175 billion by 2020 

using a globally distributed workforce to provide valueadded services presents a number of challenges to it services and bpokpo providers the offshore implementation of valueadded it services requires that it service providers continually and effectively attract train and retain highly skilled software development professionals with advanced technical and industry skills necessary to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences these skills are necessary to design develop and deploy highquality technology solutions in a costeffective and timely manner in addition it service providers must have the methodologies processes and communications capabilities to enable offshore workforces to be successfully integrated with onsite personnel service providers must also have strong research and development capabilities technology competency centers and relationship management skills in order to compete effectively

our solution and services 

we believe that we have developed an effective integrated global delivery business model and this business model is expected to be a critical element of our continued growth to support this business model at december 31 2009 we employed approximately 78400 professionals and support staff globally we also have established facilities and technology and communication infrastructures to support our business model 

across each of our business segments we provide a broad and expanding range of consulting information technology and outsourcing services including 

consulting and technology services 

 

  

  

  

 in both of these approaches our onsite team members work closely and collaboratively with our clients detailed design implementation and testing are generally performed offshore at our 47 development and delivery centers located in india china argentina mexico the philippines and hungary as well as in bentonville ar boston ma bridgewater nj chicago il phoenix az amsterdam and toronto in addition we maintain an onsite presence at each customer location in order to address evolving customer needs and resulting changes to the project 

a key part of our application development and integration offering is a suite of services to help organizations build and integrate business applications with the rest of their operations in this suite of services we leverage our skills in business application development and enterprise application integration to build sophisticated business applications and to integrate these new applications and websites with client server and legacy systems we build and deploy robust scalable and extensible architectures for use in a wide range of industries we maintain competency centers specializing in microsoft ibm sap oracle and java applications among others in order to be able to provide application development and integration services to a broad spectrum of customers 

our reengineering service offerings assist customers migrating from systems based on legacy computing environments to newer standardsbased distribution architectures often in response to the more stringent demands of business our reengineering tools automate many of the processes required to implement advanced technology platforms we believe that this automation substantially reduces the time and cost to perform reengineering services savings that benefit both us and our customers these tools also enable us to perform source code analysis and to redesign target databases and convert certain programming languages if necessary our programmers also help customers redesign and convert user interfaces 

  

 outsourcing services 

 

 we provide services to help ensure that a customer’s core operational systems are free of defects and responsive to the customer’s changing needs as part of this process we are often able to introduce product and process enhancements and improve service levels to customers requesting modifications and ongoing support 

our global delivery business model enables us to provide a range of rapid response and costeffective support services to our customers our onsite team members often provide helpdesk services at the customer’s facility these team members typically are available in the event of an emergency service request and are able to quickly resolve customer problems from remote locations in the case of more complex maintenance services including modifications enhancements and documentation which typically have longer turnaround times we take full advantage of our offshore resources to develop solutions more costeffectively than would be possible relying on higher cost local professionals the services provided by our offshore team members are delivered to customers using satellite and fiberoptic communications 

as part of our application maintenance services we assist customers in renovating their core systems to meet the requirements imposed by new regulations new standards or other external events these services include or have previously included year 2000 compliance eurocurrency compliance decimalization within the securities industry and compliance with the health insurance portability and accountability act for the healthcare industry 

we seek to anticipate the operational environment of our customers’ it systems as we design and develop such systems we also offer diagnostic services to customers to assist them in identifying shortcomings in their it systems and optimizing the performance of their systems 

 

  

   

in addition to our industryspecific expertise and focus our strengths which we believe differentiate us from other it service providers include the following 

established and scalable proprietary processes we have a comprehensive process framework that addresses the entire software engineering life cycle and support activities which are scalable for projects of different sizes and complexities this proprietary framework which we refer to as “process space” part of cognizant 20 is supported by inhouse project management metrics management and workflow tools and is available to all of our programmers globally process space has evolved since its original release in 1996 in breadth depth and maturity based on the implementation feedback from projects and findings of internal quality audits and external assessments process capabilities are monitored at the subprocess level and performance targets are monitored at the process level which are aligned with the overall business objectives statistical process controls are used extensively to continuously monitor predict and improve performance our quality assurance group facilitates process implementation from the project inception and audits the projects periodically to ensure that the implementation is effective and the risks are being managed 

our process framework complies with the requirements of iso 9001 tl 9000 for telecom projects and iso 20000 for infrastructure projects our delivery processes support processes and their implementation are formally certified by dnv det norske veritas in the above mentioned standards kpmg appraises our enterprisewide operations to be at cmmi maturity level 5 which is the highest possible maturity level rating of the capability maturity model integration v12 cmmi of the software engineering institute at carnegie mellon university our bpo service offering is assessed at escm maturity level 4 which is the highest possible rating for the first attempt of the esourcing capability model of it services qualification center at carnegie mellon university finally all of our principal development centers have been certified by the stqc directorate ministry of communications and information technology government of india the accreditation authority for companies in india under the internationally recognized iso 27001 previously bs 77992 information security standards a comprehensive set of controls comprising best practices in information security and business continuity planning we have implemented the above process framework enterprisewide to ensure that we consistently deliver high quality of products and services to our clients from all global operations we have invested considerably to develop a number of software automation tools designed to improve process institutionalization for example we have created and rolled out “cognizant 20” this is an intelligent delivery ecosystem which orchestrates across the organization best practice methodologies and the collaboration and archival of knowledge cognizant 20 has already been rolled out over a significant number of projects and is quickly becoming a one stop shop for all project management metrics and knowledge management cognizant 20 gradually replaces the existing set of internally developed tools such as prolite etracker and qsmart 

our process framework has been extensively adapted to cater to different types of projects managed by the organization including application development application maintenance testing mass change data migration reengineering business process outsourcing it infrastructure and package development projects 

highly skilled workforce our managers and senior technical personnel provide indepth project management expertise to customers to maintain this level of expertise we have placed significant emphasis on recruiting and training our workforce of highly skilled professionals we have approximately 8300 project managers and senior technical personnel around the world many of whom have significant work experience in north america europe and asia we also maintain programs and personnel to hire and train the best available technical professionals in both legacy systems and emerging technologies we provide five months of combined classroom and onthejob training to newly hired programmers as well as additional annual training programs designed to enhance the business practices tools technology and consulting skills of our professional staff we were assessed by kpmg at level 5 the highest possible rating of the people capability maturity model pcmm of the software engineering institute at carnegie mellon university this widely recognized means of implementing current best practices in fields such as human resources knowledge management and organizational development help improve our processes for managing and developing our workforce and addressing critical people issues 

  

research and development and competency centers  we have project experience and expertise across multiple architectures and technologies and have made significant investments in our competency centers and in research and development to keep abreast of the latest technology developments most of our programmers are trained in multiple technologies and architectures as a result we are able to react to customers’ needs quickly and efficiently redeploy programmers to different technologies also to develop and maintain this flexibility we have made a substantial investment in our competency centers so that the experience gained from particular projects and research and development efforts is leveraged across our entire organization in addition through our investment in research and development activities and the continuing education of our technical personnel we enlarge our knowledge base and develop the necessary skills to keep pace with emerging technologies we believe that our ability to work in new technologies allows us to foster longterm relationships by having the capacity to continually address the needs of both existing and new customers 

welldeveloped infrastructure our extensive facilities technology and communications infrastructure facilitate the seamless integration of our global workforces this is accomplished by permitting team members in different locations to access common project information and to work directly on customer projects this infrastructure allows for 

 

  

  

  

 international time differences enable our offshore teams to access a customer’s computing facilities located in north america europe the asia pacific region and other countries in which we provide services during offpeak hours this ability to perform services during offpeak hours enables us to complete projects more rapidly and does not require our customers to invest in duplicative hardware and software in addition for large projects with short time frames our offshore facilities allow for parallel processing of various development phases to accelerate delivery time in addition we can deliver services more rapidly than some competitors without an offshore labor pool because our lower labor costs enable us to costeffectively assign more professionals to a project 

business strategies 

our objectives are to maximize stockholder value and enhance our position as a leading provider of information technology consulting and business outsourcing services we implement the following core strategies to achieve these objectives 

further develop longterm customer relationships we have strong longterm strategic relationships with our customers and business partners we seek to establish longterm relationships that present recurring revenue opportunities frequently trying to establish relationships with our customers’ chief information officers or other it decision makers by offering a wide array of costeffective high quality services approximately 97 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2008 we also seek to leverage our experience with a customer’s it systems into new business opportunities knowledge of a customer’s processes and it systems gained during the performance of application maintenance services for example may provide us with a competitive advantage in securing additional maintenance development and other projects from that customer 

expand service offerings and solutions we have several teams dedicated to developing new high value services these teams collaborate with customers to develop these services for example we are currently developing new offerings in business and it consulting and verticallyoriented it solutions atop innovative technologies such as service oriented architectures soa and web 20 we invest in internal research and development and promote 

  

knowledge building and sharing across the organization to promote the development of new services and solutions furthermore we continue to enhance our capabilities and service offerings in the areas of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that the continued expansion of our service offerings will reduce our reliance on any one technology initiative and may help foster longterm relationships with our customers by allowing us to better serve their needs among service offerings infrastructure management and verticallyoriented business and knowledge process outsourcing have been among the key drivers of growth 

enhance processes methodologies and productivity toolsets with the globalization of business we are committed to improving and enhancing our proprietary process space software engineering process and other methodologies and toolsets in light of the rapid evolution of technology we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our continued success we are constantly designing and developing additional productivity software tools to automate testing processes and improve project estimation and risk assessment techniques for example we have created and rolled out “cognizant 20” which uses groupware technology based on web 20 technologies enabling cognizant associates to share project experiences and best practice methodologies across the organization with the objective of improving productivity 

expand domestic and international geographic presence  as we expand our customer base we plan to open additional sales and marketing offices in north america europe latin america and asia this expansion is expected to facilitate sales and service to existing and new customers we have established various sales and marketing offices in several metropolitan areas including atlanta ga boston ma bridgewater nj chicago il dallas tx minneapolis mn phoenix az los angeles ca norwalk ct san francisco ca and teaneck nj in addition we have been pursuing market opportunities internationally through our international sales and marketing offices including amsterdam brussels buenos aires chennai cyberjaya malaysia frankfurt geneva london melbourne paris shanghai singapore stockholm tokyo toronto and zurich 

continue to be an employer of choice in the industry as a rapidly growing professional services firm a key attribute of our continued success is the ability to continually hire assimilate motivate and retain the best talent possible in the industry we have developed strong relationships with key universities around the world particularly in india to provide a continual funnel of talented staff from tier one schools in addition we continue to expand our presence and brand in our key supply markets further enhancing our ability to hire experienced professionals from competing it services firms and industry to support our client needs and growth we invest heavily in training programs centered around cognizant academy motivational programs and career development to ensure personal professional growth for each of our associates 

pursue selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances  we believe that opportunities exist in the fragmented market in which we operate to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances we believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence and our capabilities more rapidly especially in geographic markets and key industries for example in 2009 we completed four acquisitions to strengthen our oracle retail solutions services practice our it infrastructure services practice our engineering and manufacturing solutions ems practice and our financial services kpo  bpo practice and enhance our service delivery capabilities in india in addition through our working relationships with independent software vendors we obtain projects using the detailed knowledge we gain in connection with a joint development process finally we expect to continue to form strategic alliances with select it service firms that offer complementary services to best meet the requirements of our customers 

  

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our services directly through our professional staff senior management and direct sales personnel operating out of our teaneck new jersey headquarters and our business development offices which are strategically located in various metropolitan areas around the world including atlanta ga boston ma bridgewater nj chicago il dallas tx los angeles ca minneapolis mn norwalk ct phoenix az san francisco ca teaneck nj amsterdam brussels buenos aires chennai cyberjaya malaysia frankfurt geneva london melbourne paris shanghai stockholm singapore tokyo toronto and zurich at december 31 2009 we had 86 direct sales persons and 860 account managers and client partners the sales and marketing group works with our technical team as the sales process moves closer to the customer’s selection of a services provider the duration of the sales process varies depending on the type of service ranging from approximately two months to over one year the account manager or sales executive works with the technical team to 

 

  

  

  

 management reviews and approves proposals which are then presented to the prospective customer our sales and account management personnel remain actively involved in the project through the execution phase we focus our marketing efforts on businesses with intensive information processing needs we maintain a prospectcustomer database that is continuously updated and used throughout the sales cycle from prospect qualification to close as a result of this marketing system we prequalify sales opportunities and direct sales representatives are able to minimize the time spent on prospect qualification in addition substantial emphasis is placed on customer retention and expansion of services provided to existing customers in this regard our account managers play an important marketing role by leveraging their ongoing relationship with the customer to identify opportunities to expand and diversify the type of services provided to that customer 

customers 

the number of customers served by us has increased significantly in recent years as of december 31 2009 we were providing services to approximately 589 customers as compared to approximately 565 customers as of december 31 2008 and approximately 500 customers as of december 31 2007 accordingly we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment however no individual customer exceeded 100 of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 791 791 and 828 of our revenue respectively was from north american customers 

for the year ended december 31 2009 we derived our revenues from the following business segments 429 from financial services 263 from healthcare 172 from retailmanufacturinglogistics and 136 from other 

we provide services either on a timeandmaterial basis or on a fixed price basis the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a significant customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highly skilled it development and other professionals in particular we need to attract train and retain project managers programmers and other senior technical personnel we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for it development professionals in the united states europe and in india with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer we have an active recruitment program in india and have developed a recruiting system and database that facilitates the rapid identification of skilled candidates during the course of the year we conduct extensive recruiting efforts at premier colleges and technical schools in india we evaluate candidates based on academic performance the results of a written aptitude test measuring problemsolving skills and a technical interview in addition we have an active lateral recruiting program in north america europe and india a substantial majority of the personnel on most onsite teams and virtually all the personnel staffed on offshore teams is comprised of indian nationals 

  

our senior project managers are hired from leading consulting firms in the united states europe and india our senior management and most of our project managers have experience working in the united states and europe this enhances our ability to attract and retain other professionals with experience in the united states and europe we have also adopted a career and education management program to define our employees’ objectives and career plans we have implemented an intensive orientation and training program to introduce new employees to the process space software engineering process our other technologies and our services

corporate history 

we began our it development and maintenance services business in early 1994 as an inhouse technology development center for the dun  bradstreet corporation and its operating units in 1996 we along with certain other entities were spunoff from the dun  bradstreet corporation to form a new company cognizant corporation on june 24 1998 we completed an initial public offering of our class a common stock on june 30 1998 a majority interest in us and certain other entities were spunoff from cognizant corporation to form ims health subsequently cognizant corporation was renamed nielsen media research incorporated 

on january 30 2003 we filed a tender offer in which ims health stockholders could exchange ims health shares held by them for our class b common stock held by ims health on february 13 2003 ims health distributed all of our class b common stock that ims health owned in an exchange offer to its stockholders on february 21 2003 pursuant to the terms of our restated certificate of incorporation all of the shares of class b common stock automatically converted into shares of class a common stock since february 21 2003 there have been no outstanding shares of class b common stock effective may 26 2004 pursuant to our certificate of incorporation there are no authorized shares of class b common stock 

on april 12 2004 our board of directors declared a conditional twoforone stock split to be effected by a 100 stock dividend payable on june 17 2004 to stockholders of record as of may 27 2004 the stock split was subject to stockholder approval which was obtained on may 26 2004 and as a result the stock dividend was paid on june 17 2004 to stockholders of record as of may 27 2004

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the risks and uncertainties detailed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

our global operations are subject to complex risks some of which might be beyond our control 

we have offices and operations in various countries around the world and provide services to clients globally in 2009 approximately 791 of our revenues were attributable to the north american region 185 were attributable to the european region and 24 were attributable to the asia pacific region if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations including regulatory economic political and other uncertainties in india fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates international hostilities terrorism natural disasters and multiple legal and regulatory systems our results of operations could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india and we are subject to regulatory economic political and other uncertainties in india 

we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india where a majority of our technical professionals are located while wage costs are lower in india than in the united states and other developed countries for comparably skilled professionals wages in india have historically increased at a faster rate than in the united states if this were to continue in the future it would result in increased costs for our 

  

skilled professionals and thereby potentially reducing our operating margins also there is no assurance that in future periods competition for skilled professionals will not drive higher salaries in india thereby resulting in increased costs for our technical professionals and reduced operating margins 

india has also recently experienced civil unrest and terrorism and has been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries in recent years there have been military confrontations between india and pakistan that have occurred in the region of kashmir and along the indiapakistan border the potential for hostilities between the two countries has been high in light of tensions related to recent terrorist incidents in india and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment including events in and related to afghanistan and iraq if india were to become engaged in armed hostilities particularly if these hostilities were protracted or involved the threat of or use of weapons of mass destruction our operations would be materially adversely affected in addition companies may decline to contract with us for services in light of international terrorist incidents or armed hostilities even where india is not involved because of more generalized concerns about relying on a service provider utilizing international resources 

in the past the indian economy has experienced many of the problems confronting the economies of developing countries including high inflation erratic gross domestic product growth and shortages of foreign exchange the indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy and indian government actions concerning the economy could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities including us in the past the indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy including the software development services industry programs that have benefited us include among others tax holidays liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation notwithstanding these benefits india’s central and state governments remain significantly involved in the indian economy as regulators in recent years the indian government has introduced nonincome related taxes including the fringe benefit tax which was repealed as of april 1 2009 and new service taxes and incomerelated taxes including the minimum alternative tax in addition a change in government leadership in india or change in policies of the existing government in india that results in the elimination of any of the benefits realized by us from our indian operations or the imposition of new taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the emergence of a widespread health emergency or pandemic could create economic or financial disruption that could negatively affect our revenue and operations or impair our ability to manage our business in certain parts of the world 

our international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties 

revenues from customers outside north america represented approximately 209 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 we anticipate that revenues from customers outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence particularly in europe the asia pacific and latin america regions in addition the majority of our employees and our development and delivery centers are located in india as a result we may be subject to risks associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may cause volatility in our reported income and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions from time to time we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate our risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations the use of hedging contracts is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of our foreign operations but does not completely eliminate volatility and risk in addition use of hedging contracts includes the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in addition we may face competition in other countries from companies that may 

  

have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations we may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture our international expansion plans may not be successful and we may not be able to compete effectively in other countries there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the indian rupee and other foreign currency exchange rates 

although we report our operating results in us dollars a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues income from operations other income expense net and the value of balance sheet items originally denominated in other currencies during the year ended december 31 2009 the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar favorably impacted our operating margins by 255 basis points or 255 percentage points as compared to 2008 additionally during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded net foreign currency gains of 17 million inclusive of losses of 208 million on undesignated balance sheet hedges there is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations or that any efforts by us to engage in currency hedging activities will be effective in addition in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which could limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations finally as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee against the us dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency 

our operating results may be adversely affected by our use of derivative financial instruments 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in india these contracts are intended to partially offset the impact of the movement of the exchange rates on future operating costs in addition we also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate foreign currency risk on indian rupee denominated net monetary assets the hedging strategies that we have implemented or may implement to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market operational and counterparty credit risks accordingly we may incur losses from our use of derivative financial instruments that could have a material adverse affect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violations of these regulations could harm our business 

because we provide services to clients throughout the world we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal rules on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations violations of these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these laws or regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual 

  

obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries of which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in many parts of the world including countries in which we operate practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance our employees subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these policies or procedures or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations violations of these laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions including fines and suspension or disqualification from government contracting any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

international hostilities terrorist activities other violence or war natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could delay or reduce the number of new service orders we receive and impair our ability to service our customers thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

hostilities involving the united states and other acts of terrorism violence or war such as the attacks of september 11 2001 in the united states the attacks of july 7 2005 in the united kingdom the attacks of november 26 2008 in mumbai india and the continuing conflict in iraq and afghanistan natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat or perceived potential for these events could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to service our customers such events could cause customers to delay their decisions on spending for information technology consulting and business and knowledge process outsourcing services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our clients which could affect our financial results by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients the majority of our technical professionals are located in india and the vast majority of our technical professionals in the united states and europe are indian nationals who are able to work in the united states and europe only because they hold current visas and work permits travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

although we continue to believe that we have a strong competitive position in the united states we continue to increase our efforts to geographically diversify our clients and revenue despite our efforts to diversify hostilities involving the united states the united kingdom india and other countries in which we provide services to our clients and other acts of terrorism violence or war natural disasters global health risks or pandemics may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability while we plan and prepare to defend against each of these occurrences we might be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against all such occurrences if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients our operating results could be adversely affected 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our customers 

the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest market for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by united states companies are periodically considered in 

  

congress and in numerous state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs in the united states senators richard durbin dillinois and charles grassley riowa have introduced a bill which would if enacted severely restrict the use of certain temporary business visas given the ongoing debate over this issue the introduction and consideration of other restrictive legislation is possible if enacted such measures may 1 broaden restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly 2 impact private industry with measures such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions andor 3 restrict the use of certain business visas in the event that any of these measures become law our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to service our customers could be impaired 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data particularly involving service providers in india current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to offshore providers to avoid negative perceptions that may be associated with using an offshore provider any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward offshore outsourcing would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide services from within the country in which our clients operate 

legislation enacted in certain european jurisdictions and any future legislation in europe countries within the asia pacific region or any other country in which we have clients restricting the performance of business process services from an offshore location could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example new legislation recently enacted in the united kingdom based on the 1977 ec acquired rights directive has been adopted in some form by many european union or eu countries and provides that if a company outsources all or part of its business to a service provider or changes its current service provider the affected employees of the company or of the previous service provider are entitled to become employees of the new service provider generally on the same terms and conditions as their original employment in addition dismissals of employees who were employed by the company or the previous service provider immediately prior to that transfer are automatically considered unfair dismissals that entitle such employees to compensation as a result in order to avoid unfair dismissal claims we may have to offer and become liable for voluntary redundancy payments to the employees of our clients who outsource business to us in the united kingdom and other eu countries who have adopted similar laws this legislation may materially affect our ability to obtain new business from companies in the united kingdom and eu and to provide outsourced services to companies in the united kingdom and eu in a costeffective manner 

our growth may be hindered by immigration restrictions 

our future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills from developing countries especially india the vast majority of our it professionals in the united states and in europe are indian nationals the ability of indian nationals to work in the united states and europe depends on their ability and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits 

the h1b visa classification enables united states employers to hire qualified foreign workers in positions that require an education at least equal to a fouryear bachelor degree in the united states in specialty occupations such as it systems engineering and systems analysis the h1b visa usually permits an individual to work and live in the united states for a period of up to six years under certain limited circumstances h1b visa extensions after the sixyear period may be available there is a limit on the number of new h1b petitions that the united states citizenship and immigration services or cis one of the successor agencies to the immigration and naturalization service may approve in any federal fiscal year and in years in which this limit is reached we may be unable to obtain h1b visas necessary to bring foreign employees to the united states currently the limit is 65000 for holders of united states or united statesequivalent bachelor degrees the general cap and an additional 20000 for holders of advanced degrees from united states postsecondary educational institutions although cis has reached its general cap and advanced degree cap for fiscal year 2010 we expect to be able to 

  

file h1b petitions with cis against the fiscal year 2011 caps beginning april 1 2010 for work in h1b status beginning on october 1 2011 as a part of our advanced planning process we believe that we have sufficient employees visaready to meet our anticipated business growth in the current year in addition there are strict labor regulations associated with the h1b visa classification larger users of the h1b visa program are often subject to investigations by the wage and hour division of the united states department of labor a finding by the united states department of labor of willful or substantial failure to comply with existing regulations on the h1b classification may result in backpay liability substantial fines andor a ban on future use of the h1b program and other immigration benefits 

we also regularly transfer employees from india to the united states to work on projects at client sites using the l1 visa classification the l1 visa allows companies abroad to transfer certain managers executives and employees with specialized company knowledge to related united states companies such as a parent subsidiary affiliate joint venture or branch office we have an approved “blanket l program” under which the corporate relationships of our transferring and receiving entities have been preapproved by cis thus enabling individual l1 visa applications to be presented directly to a visaissuing united states consular post abroad rather than undergoing a preapproval process through cis in the united states in recent years both the united states consular posts that review initial l1 applications and cis which adjudicates petitions for initial grants and extensions of l1 status have become increasingly restrictive with respect to this category as a result the rate of refusals of initial l1 petitions and extensions has increased in addition even where l1 visas are ultimately granted and issued security measures undertaken by united states consular posts around the world have delayed visa issuances our inability to bring qualified technical personnel into the united states to staff onsite customer locations would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

on december 8 2004 president bush signed the l1 visa reform act which was part of the fiscal year 2005 omnibus appropriations act public law 108447 at division j title iv this legislation contained several important changes to the laws governing l1 visa holders all of the changes took effect on june 8 2005 under one provision of this law all l1 applicants including those brought to the united states under a blanket l program must have worked abroad with the related company for one full year in the prior three years the provision allowing blanket l applicants who had worked abroad for the related company for six months during the qualifying threeyear period was revoked in addition l1b holders intracompany transferees with specialized company knowledge may not be primarily stationed at the work site of another employer if the l1b visa holder will be controlled and supervised by an employer other than the petitioning employer finally l1b status may not be granted where placement of the l1b visa holder at a third party site is part of an arrangement to provide labor for the third party rather than placement at the site in connection with the provision of a product or service involving specialized knowledge specific to the petitioning employer 

we do not place l1b workers at third party sites where they are under the primary supervision of a different employer nor do we place l1b workers at third party sites in an arrangement to provide labor for the third party without providing a service involving our specialized knowledge since implementation of this law we consistently have established this fact to cis’s satisfaction however if cis andor the united states department of state through its visaissuing consular posts abroad decide to interpret these provisions in a very restrictive fashion this could impair our ability to staff our projects in the united states with resources from our entities abroad in addition cis has not yet issued regulations governing these statutory provisions if such regulations are restrictive in nature this could impair our ability to staff our projects in the united states with resources from our entities abroad 

we also process immigrant visas for lawful permanent residence in the united states for employees to fill positions for which there are an insufficient number of able willing and qualified united states workers available to fill the positions compliance with existing united states immigration and labor laws or changes in those laws making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting our ability to successfully obtain permanent residence for our foreign employees in the united states could require us to incur additional 

  

unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the united states any of these restrictions or limitations on our hiring practices could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to immigration restrictions in the united states there are certain restrictions on transferring employees to work in the united kingdom where we have experienced significant growth the united kingdom currently requires that all employees who are not nationals of european union countries plus nationals of bulgaria and romania or eea nationals obtain work permission before obtaining a visaentry clearance to travel to the united kingdom new european nations such as hungary poland lithuania slovakia and the czech republic do not have a work permit requirement but employees need to register to work within 30 days of arrival on november 27 2008 the united kingdom introduced a pointsbased system under which certain certificates of sponsorship are issued by licensed employer sponsors provided the employees they seek to employ in the united kingdom can accumulate a certain number of points based on certain attributes where the employee has not worked for a cognizant group company outside the united kingdom for at least 6 months we will need to carry out a resident labor market test to confirm that the intended role cannot be filled by an eea national we are currently an arated sponsor and were allocated certificates of sponsorship which we believe are sufficient to meet our demand for transfers to the united kingdom 

immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the united states the united kingdom and other countries are subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement immigration and work permit laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity our international expansion strategy and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with it professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed 

our revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in the united states and europe as well as on clients concentrated in certain industries including the financial services industry continuing or worsening economic conditions or factors that negatively affect the economic health of the united states europe or these industries may adversely affect our business 

approximately 791 of our revenues during the year ended december 31 2009 were derived from customers located in north america in the same period approximately 185 of our revenues were derived from customers located in europe if the united states or european economy continues to weaken or slow and conditions in the financial markets continue to deteriorate pricing for our services may be depressed and our customers may reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability additionally any prolonged recession in the united states and europe could have an adverse impact on our revenues because a large portion of our revenues are derived from the united states and europe in addition during the year ended december 31 2009 we earned approximately 429 of our revenues from the financial services industry which includes insurance a continuation of the current crisis in the financial services industry and significant consolidation in that industry or a decrease in growth or consolidation in other industry segments on which we focus may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability in addition if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions affecting the industries and markets in which we operate we may be unable to effectively plan for or respond to those changes and our business could be negatively affected 

  

we face intense competition from other service providers 

the intensely competitive information technology consulting and business process outsourcing professional services markets includes a large number of participants and is subject to rapid change these markets includes participants from a variety of market segments including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these markets also include numerous smaller local competitors in the various geographic markets in which we operate which may be able to provide services and solutions at lower costs or on terms more attractive to clients than we can our direct competitors who use the onsiteoffshore business model include among others infosys technologies tata consultancy services and wipro in addition many of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition and therefore may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals some of these larger competitors such as accenture electronic data systems acquired by hewlettpackard company perot systems acquired by dell inc and ibm global services have offshore operations there is a risk that increased competition could put downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services and on our operating margins similarly if our competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity they may be able to offer services similar to ours at lower prices without adversely affecting their profit margins even if our offerings address industry and client needs our competitors may be more successful at selling their services if we are unable to provide our clients with superior services and solutions at competitive prices our results of operations may suffer further a client may choose to use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm to perform the types of services we provide we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our current levels of profitability or growth as competitive pressures including competition for skilled technology professionals and pricing pressure from competitors employing an onsiteoffshore business model increase 

in addition we may face competition from companies that increase in size or scope as the result of strategic mergers or acquisitions these transactions may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers software companies and vendors and service providers the result of any such vertical integration may be greater integration of products and services that were once offered separately by independent vendors our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this industry trend which could adversely affect our competitive position 

we may not be able to sustain our current level of profitability 

for the year ended december 31 2009 we reported an operating margin of 189 our operating margin may decline if we experience declines in demand and pricing for our services imposition of new nonincome related taxes or due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition historically wages in india increased at a faster rate than in the united states additionally the number and type of equitybased compensation awards and the assumptions used in valuing equitybased compensation awards may change resulting in increased stockbased compensation expense and lower margins although we have historically been able to partially offset wage increases and foreign currency fluctuations through further leveraging the scale of our operating structure obtaining price increases and issuing a lower number of stock options and other equitybased compensation awards in proportion to our overall headcount we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 

  

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to control our costs 

our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency affects our profitability if we are unable to control our costs or improve our efficiency our profitability could be negatively affected 

our business will suffer if we fail to develop new services and enhance our existing services in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological environment 

the information technology consulting and outsourcing services market is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions our future success will depend on our ability to develop solutions that keep pace with changes in the markets in which we provide services we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing new services addressing evolving technologies on a timely or costeffective basis or if these services are developed that we will be successful in the marketplace in addition we cannot assure you that products services or technologies developed by others will not render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to remain competitive will also depend on our ability to design and implement in a timely and costeffective manner solutions for customers that both leverage their legacy systems and appropriately utilize newer technologies such as web 20 models softwareasaservice and service oriented architectures our failure to design and implement solutions in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may face difficulties in providing endtoend business solutions for our clients that could cause clients to discontinue their work with us which in turn could harm our business 

we have been expanding the nature and scope of our engagements and have added new service offerings such as it consulting business and knowledge process outsourcing systems integration and outsourcing of entire portions of it infrastructure the success of these service offerings is dependent in part upon continued demand for such services by our existing and new clients and our ability to meet this demand in a costcompetitive and effective manner in addition our ability to effectively offer a wider breadth of endtoend business solutions depends on our ability to attract existing or new clients to these service offerings to obtain engagements for such endtoend solutions we also are more likely to compete with large wellestablished international consulting firms resulting in increased competition and marketing costs accordingly we cannot be certain that our new service offerings will effectively meet client needs or that we will be able to attract existing and new clients to these service offerings 

the increased breadth of our service offerings may result in larger and more complex projects with our clients this will require us to establish closer relationships with our clients and a thorough understanding of their operations our ability to establish such relationships will depend on a number of factors including the proficiency of our professionals and our management personnel our failure to understand our client requirements or our failure to deliver services which meet the requirements specified by our clients could result in termination of client contracts and we could be liable to our clients for significant penalties or damages 

larger projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements these terminations cancellations or delays may result from the business or financial condition of our clients or the economy generally as opposed to factors related to the quality of our services such cancellations or delays make it difficult to plan for project resource requirements and inaccuracies in such resource planning may have a negative impact on our profitability 

  

if our clients are not satisfied with our services our business could be adversely affected 

our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing clients our business model also depends on relationships our account teams develop with our clients so that we can understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to those needs if a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or with the type of services or solutions delivered then we could incur additional costs to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the client’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client in particular clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors in addition negative publicity related to our client services or relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients 

we rely on a few customers for a large portion of our revenues 

our top five customers generated approximately 174 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a major customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year the loss of one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we generally do not have longterm contracts with our customers and our results of operations could be adversely affected if our clients terminate their contracts with us on short notice 

consistent with industry practice we generally do not enter into longterm contracts with our customers a majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice and without significant early termination cost terminations may result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project including the business or financial conditions of the client changes in ownership or management at our clients changes in client strategies or the economy or markets generally when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to eliminate our associated costs in a timely manner consequently our profit margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected if we are unable to replace the lost revenue with other work on terms we find acceptable or effectively eliminate costs we may not be able to maintain our level of profitability 

our results of operations may be affected by the rate of growth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of technology spending by our clients 

our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients and their customers and suppliers in challenging economic environments our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities at the same time many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel processes and infrastructures if the growth of use of technology in business or our clients’ spending on technology in business declines or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new technology solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our clients our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our 

  

allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions such as the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system could also result in financial difficulties including limited access to the credit markets insolvency or bankruptcy for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

we are investing substantial cash assets in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately 

we have made and continue to make significant contractual commitments related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our development and delivery centers we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability may be reduced 

competition for highly skilled technical personnel is intense and the success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled professionals 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highly skilled professionals so as to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand in particular we must attract train and retain appropriate numbers of talented people including project managers it engineers and other senior technical personnel with diverse skills in order to serve client needs and grow our business we are particularly dependent on retaining our senior executives and other experienced managers with the skill sets required by our business and if we are unable to do so our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized similarly the profitability of our business model depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to support our projects the processes and costs associated with recruiting training and retaining employees place significant demands on our resources 

we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for professionals in the united states europe and india with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer we have subcontracted to a limited extent in the past and may do so in the future with other service providers in order to meet our obligations to our customers our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend in large part on our ability to attract train and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences further we must train and manage our growing work force requiring an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel we cannot assure you that the management skills and systems currently in place will be adequate or that we will be able to train and assimilate new employees successfully our profits and ability to compete for and manage client engagements could be adversely affected if we cannot manage employee hiring and attrition to achieve an efficient workforce structure 

our ability to operate and compete effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel or if we cannot attract additional qualified personnel 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of the key members of our management team as well as marketing sales and technical personnel and our ability to attract and retain new management and other personnel we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or significant employees competition for personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we 

  

will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting and retaining new personnel in the future the loss of any one or more of our key personnel or the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

restrictions in noncompetition agreements with our executive officers may not be enforceable 

we have entered into noncompetition agreements with our executive officers we cannot assure you however that the restrictions in these agreements prohibiting such executive officers from engaging in competitive activities are enforceable further substantially all of our professional nonexecutive staff are not covered by agreements that would prohibit them from working for our competitors if any of our key professional personnel leaves our employment and joins one of our competitors our business could be adversely affected 

our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate earnings in india or if such earnings become subject to us tax on a current basis 

effective january 1 2002 and in accordance with authoritative literature we no longer accrue incremental us taxes on all indian earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these earnings as well as other foreign earnings for all periods are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur in the future that could effectively force us to change our intent not to repatriate our foreign earnings if we change our intent and repatriate such earnings we will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than our effective income tax rate in 2009 these increased taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in early 2009 president obama’s administration announced a number of taxrelated legislative proposals that would among other things seek to effectively tax certain profits of us companies earned abroad although the president did not include several of these proposals in the budget he announced in early 2010 congress could consider any of these measures at any time if enacted into law and depending on their precise terms these proposals could increase our tax rate and tax payments and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results may be negatively impacted upon the loss of certain tax benefits provided by india to companies in our industry as well as from proposed tax legislation in india 

our indian subsidiaries are exportoriented companies which under the indian income tax act of 1961 are entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each software technology park or stp with respect to export profits for each stp substantially all of the earnings of our indian subsidiaries are attributable to export profits the majority of our stps in india are currently entitled to a 100 exemption from indian income tax under current indian tax law export profits after march 31 2011 from our existing stps will be fully taxable at the indian statutory rate which is currently 3399 in effect at such time if the tax holidays relating to our indian stps are not extended or new tax incentives are not introduced that would effectively extend the income tax holiday benefits beyond march 31 2011 we expect that our effective income tax rate will increase significantly beginning in calendar year 2011 

if our pricing structures do not accurately anticipate the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions we contract to provide services either on a timeandmaterials basis or on a fixedprice basis our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated 

  

we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations and utilizing workforces with different skill sets and competencies across geographically distributed service locations our pricing cost and profit margin estimates for the work that we perform frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract there is a risk that we will underprice our projects fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our profit margin 

in addition a significant portion of our projects are on a fixedprice basis subjecting us to the foregoing risks to an even greater extent fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 303 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 we expect that an increasing number of our future projects will be contracted on a fixedprice basis in addition to the other risks described in the paragraph above we bear the risk of cost overruns and operating cost inflation in connection with projects covered by fixedprice contracts our failure to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a fixedprice project or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within the time frame committed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing rates 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to recover for our services if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our profit margin and our profitability could suffer the rates we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable utilization rates 

the cost of providing our services including the utilization rate of our professionals affects our profitability if we are not able to maintain an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals our profit margin and our profitability may suffer our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

   

  

 if we do not continue to improve our operational financial and other internal controls and systems to manage our rapid growth and size or if we are unable to enter operate and compete effectively in new geographic markets our business may suffer and the value of our shareholders’ investment may be harmed 

our anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources our growth will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls both in the united states india and elsewhere in particular our continued growth will increase the challenges involved in 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that an employee will engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks despite our efforts to train our people and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired 

as part of our growth strategy we are expanding our operations in europe asia middle east and latin america we may not be able to compete effectively in these markets and the cost of entering these markets may be substantially greater than we expect if we fail to compete effectively in the new markets we enter or if the cost of entering those markets is substantially greater than we expect our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we cannot compete effectively we may be required to reconsider our strategy to invest in our international expansion plans and change our intent on the repatriation of our earnings 

our operating results may experience significant quarterly fluctuations 

we historically have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations and expect these fluctuations to continue among the factors causing these variations have been 

 

  

  

  

 in addition our future revenues operating margins and profitability may fluctuate as a result of 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a high percentage of our operating expenses particularly personnel and rent are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter as a result unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects or in employee wage levels and utilization rates may cause significant variations in our operating results in any particular quarter and could result in losses any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations any material reduction in utilization rates for our professional staff or variance in the onsite offshore staffing mix an unanticipated termination of a major project a customer’s decision not to pursue a new project or proceed to succeeding stages of a current project or the completion during a quarter of several major customer projects could require us to pay underutilized employees and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as a result of these factors it is possible that in some future periods our revenues and operating results may be significantly below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such an event the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 

we could be held liable for damages or our reputation could be damaged by disclosure of confidential information or personal data or system failures 

we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information in addition many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for the failure although we attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our services we cannot assure you that any contractual limitations on liability will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages 

in addition we often have access to or are required to manage utilize collect and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data including nonpublic personal data as a result we are subject to numerous us and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant liability to our clients or our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws as well as liability and penalties in connection with any violation of applicable privacy laws andor criminal prosecution unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through breach of computer systems systems failure employee 

  

negligence fraud or misappropriation or otherwise could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients similarly unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop or manage for our clients whether by our employees or third parties could result in negative publicity legal liability and damage to our reputation 

although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be sufficient in amount to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability in connection with providing our solutions and services 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our clients we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines in addition the contracting practices of our competitors may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope andor amount of our potential liability if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide solutions and services and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements we might face significant legal liability and our business could be adversely affected 

we could incur liability or our reputation could be damaged if our provision of services and solutions to our clients contributes to our clients’ internal control deficiencies 

our clients may perform audits or require us to perform audits and provide audit reports with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such clients especially when we process data belonging to them our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion or if we cannot obtain an unqualified opinion with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit in a timely manner additionally we could incur liability if our controls and procedures or the controls and procedures we manage for a client were to result in internal controls failures or impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our business may be adversely affected 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property we presently hold no patents or registered copyrights and rely upon a combination of copyright and trade secret laws nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and various security measures to protect our intellectual property rights existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions such as china might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights india is a member of the berne convention and has agreed to recognize protections on copyrights conferred under the laws of foreign countries including the laws of the united states we believe that laws rules regulations and treaties in effect in the united states india and other countries in which we operate are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our copyrights and other intellectual property however there can be no assurance that these laws will not change and in particular that the laws of india or the united states will not change in ways that may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components libraries and toolsets from india to the united states or from the united states to india there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of any of our intellectual property or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 

  

enforcing our rights might also require considerable time money and oversight unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in development of technology products or services that compete with our products and services and unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products services or proprietary information if we are unable to protect our intellectual property our business may be adversely affected 

depending on the circumstances we might need to grant a specific client greater rights in intellectual property developed or used in connection with a contract than we generally do in certain situations we might forego all rights to the use of intellectual property we create and intend to reuse across multiple client engagements which would limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenuegenerating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we could have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients these claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions in a number of our contracts we have agreed to indemnify our clients for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area whether we ultimately win or lose could be timeconsuming and costly injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements we might not be able to enter into these royalty or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages we expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our competitors are able to obtain patents for software products and processes any infringement claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we could lose our ability or be unable to secure the right to utilize the intellectual property of others thirdparty suppliers of software hardware or other intellectual assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired our operating results could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to integrate acquired companies or technologies successfully and we may be subject to certain liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions that could harm our operating results 

we expect to continue our program of pursuing strategic acquisitions and joint ventures designed to enhance our capabilities enable us to expand our geographic presence especially in the european market enter new technology areas or expand our capacity we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates consummate any acquisition or joint venture integrate any acquired business or joint venture into our operations or achieve desired financial and operating results further acquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention and failure to retain key personnel we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources to complete the transactions our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses or technologies into our ongoing operations and assimilate employees of those businesses into our culture and operations accordingly we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition we undertake if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations we may not be 

  

able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services also we may finance any future acquisitions with cash debt financing the issuance of equity securities or a combination of the foregoing we cannot assure you that we will be able to arrange adequate financing on acceptable terms in addition acquisitions financed with the issuance of our equity securities could be dilutive 

although we conduct due diligence in connection with each of our acquisitions there may be liabilities that we fail to discover or that we inadequately assess in our due diligence efforts in particular to the extent that any acquired businesses or properties failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations or failed to fulfill their contractual obligations to customers we as the successor owner may be financially responsible for these violations and failures and may suffer reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected while we generally require the selling party to indemnify us for any and all liabilities associated with such liabilities if for any reason the seller does not perform their indemnification obligation we may be held responsible for such liabilities in addition as part of an acquisition we may assume responsibilities and obligations of the acquired business pursuant to the terms and conditions of services agreements entered by the acquired entity that are not consistent with the terms and conditions that we typically accept and require although we attempt to structure acquisitions in such a manner as to minimize the liability that could arise from such contractual commitments we cannot assure you that any of our efforts to minimize the liability will be effective in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages under such agreements the discovery of any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions for which we are unable to receive indemnification could harm our operating results 

system failure or disruptions in communications could disrupt our business and result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

to deliver our services to our customers we must maintain a high speed network of satellite fiber optic and land lines and active voice and data communications 24 hours a day between our main offices in chennai our other development and delivery centers and the offices of our customers worldwide although we maintain redundancy facilities and satellite communications links any systems failure or a significant lapse in our ability to transmit voice and data through satellite and telephone communications could result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

consolidation in the industries that we serve could adversely affect our business 

companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies if two or more of our current clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting systems integration and technology or outsourcing services we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work the increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us any of these possible results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 

our ability to attract and retain business may depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors since many of our specific client engagements involve unique services and solutions our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our clients’ evaluation of whether to engage our services we believe the cognizant brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former clients competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and 

  

the media there is a risk that negative information about our company even if based on rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business in particular damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the cognizant brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us adversely affecting our share price 

provisions in our charter bylaws and stockholders’ rights plan and provisions under delaware law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals 

provisions in our charter and bylaws each as amended our stockholders’ rights plan and delaware general corporate law or dgcl may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover proposals or delaying or preventing changes in our control or management including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices in addition these documents and provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests our board of directors has the authority without further action by the stockholders to fix the rights and preferences and issue shares of preferred stock our charter provides for a classified board of directors which will prevent a change of control of our board of directors at a single meeting of stockholders the prohibition of our stockholders’ ability to act by written consent and to call a special meeting will delay stockholder actions until annual meetings or until a special meeting is called by our chairman or chief executive officer or our board of directors the supermajorityvoting requirement for specified amendments to our charter and bylaws allows a minority of our stockholders to block those amendments the dgcl also contains provisions preventing stockholders from engaging in business combinations with us subject to certain exceptions these provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock 

compliance with new and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements adds uncertainty to our compliance policies and increases our costs of compliance 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to accounting corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 other sec regulations and the nasdaq global select market rules are creating uncertainty for companies like ours these laws regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such corporate governance standards 

in particular our efforts to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors’ audit of that assessment requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources we consistently assess the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting remediate any control deficiencies that may be identified and validate through testing that our controls are functioning as documented while we do not anticipate any material weaknesses the inability of management and our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy and effectiveness respectively of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure and our efforts to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities in addition the laws regulations and 

  

standards regarding corporate governance may make it more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with their performance of duties as a result we may face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which could harm our business if we fail to comply with new or changed laws regulations or standards of corporate governance our business and reputation may be harmed 

our share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis or be unable to properly report on our business and the results of our operations and the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected 

we are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio 

recent turmoil in the financial markets has adversely affected economic activity in the united states and other regions of the world in which we do business we believe that based on our current cash cash equivalents and investment balances and expected operating cash flows the current lack of liquidity in the credit markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity cash flow or financial flexibility continued deterioration of the credit and capital markets could result in volatility of our investment earnings and impairments to our investment portfolio which could negatively impact our financial condition and reported income the continued decline in economic activity could adversely affect the ability of counterparties to certain financial instruments such as marketable securities and derivatives to meet their obligations to us 

funds associated with auctionrate securities that we hold as investments may not be liquid and our auctionrate securities may decline in value 

as of december 31 2009 our shortterm and longterm investments totaled 4495 million and included 1291 million in longterm aaaa3rated auctionrate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans substantially backed by the federal family education loan program or ffelp in addition the remainder of our longterm investments included an asset of 220 million related to the ubs right since february 14 2008 auctions failed for all the auctionrate securities still in our portfolio as of december 31 2009 we believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities and we continue to earn and receive interest on the auctionrate municipal debt securities at a predetermined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices all of the auctionrate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par in november 2008 we accepted an offer from ubs ag or ubs to sell to ubs at par value 1513 million at december 31 2009 our auctionrate municipal debt securities at any time during an exercise period from june 30 2010 to july 2 2012 which we refer to as the ubs right in accepting the ubs right we granted ubs the authority to purchase these auctionrate municipal debt securities or sell them on our behalf at par value any time after the execution of the ubs right through july 2 2012 the offer is nontransferable ubs’s inability to perform under the ubs right and the lack of liquidity for auctionrate municipal debt securities in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

our stock price continues to be volatile 

our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive summary 

in 2009 our revenues increased to 32787 million compared to 28163 million in 2008 net income increased to 5350 million or 178 per diluted share including stockbased compensation expense and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense net of tax of 012 per diluted share during 2009 this is compared to 4308 million or 144 per diluted share including stockbased compensation expense and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense net of tax of 015 per diluted share during 2008 the key drivers of our revenue growth in 2009 were as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we saw a continued increase in demand from our customers for a broad range of it solutions including application maintenance complex systems development engagements testing enterprise resource planning or erp infrastructure management business process outsourcing and business intelligence we finished the year with approximately 589 active clients compared to approximately 565 as of december 31 2008 and increased the number of strategic clients by 16 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 144 we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate 5 million to 50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity our top five and top ten customers accounted for 174 and 294 respectively of our total revenues in 2009 as compared to 194 and 300 respectively for the year ended december 31 2008 as we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline over time 

our revenue from european customers increased by 121 to approximately 6068 million in 2009 compared to approximately 5411 million in 2008 our operation in the united kingdom or uk reported a 78 increase in revenue to approximately 3535 million in 2009 as compared to approximately 3280 million in 2008 this increase is primarily attributed to growth from existing and new customers in our healthcare and manufacturing retaillogistics business segments and was offset by yearoveryear unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates which negatively impacted revenue in 2009 by approximately 501 million revenue from europe excluding the uk increased by approximately 189 to approximately 2533 million in 2009 from approximately 2131 million in 2008 we believe that europe will continue to be an area of significant investment for us as we see this region and the asia pacific region particularly japan india australia and singapore as growth opportunities for the longterm 

our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of and strong demand for offshore it software and services and business process outsourcing recent nasscom india’s national association of software and service companies reports state that india’s it software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to reach almost 50 billion by the end of nasscom’s fiscal year march 31 2010 this is an expected growth rate of approximately 55 over the prior fiscal year additionally the fy 201011 outlook for these sectors expects revenue growth of 13 to 15 according to the latest nasscom “perspective 2020 transform business transform india” report global changes and new 

  

megatrends within economic demographic business social and environmental areas are set to expand the outsourcing industry by creating new dynamics and opportunities and are expected to result in export revenues of 175 billion by 2020 

in 2009 our operating margin increased to 189 compared to 183 in 2008 excluding stockbased compensation costs of 448 million and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 09 million operating margin in 2009 was 203 this was slightly above our historic targeted operating margin range excluding stockbased compensation costs and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 19 to 20 of total revenues the operating margin increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar and achieving operating efficiencies as a result of our revenue growth outpacing our headcount growth partially offset by an increase in compensation costs including incentivebased compensation costs and investments to grow our business historically we have invested our profitability above the 19 to 20 operating margin level which excludes stockbased compensation and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense back into our business which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth this investment is primarily focused in the areas of i hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise ii training our technical staff in a broader range of it service offerings iii strengthening our business analytic capabilities iv strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services v continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery and vi recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees in addition this investment includes maintaining a level of resources trained in a broad range of service offerings to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects for the year ending december 31 2010 we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our historical targeted operating margin levels back into the business 

we finished the year with total headcount of approximately 78400 an increase of approximately 16700 over the prior year the increases in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs to meet the demand for our services are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in 2009 annualized turnover including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 103 for 2009 the majority of our turnover occurs in india as a result annualized attrition rates onsite at clients are below our global attrition rate in addition attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff we have experienced wage inflation in india which may continue in the future however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as indian wages represented less than 20 of our total operating expenses 

our current india real estate development program includes planned construction of approximately 45 million square feet of new space the expanded program which commenced during the quarter ended march 31 2007 includes the expenditure of approximately 3300 million through the end of the program on land acquisition facilities construction and furnishings to build new stateoftheart it development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as special economic zones located in india during 2010 we expect to spend approximately 180 million globally for capital expenditures 

at december 31 2009 we had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 13993 million and working capital of approximately 16610 million accordingly we do not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues during 2009 we repurchased 124 million of our class a common stock under a stock repurchase program that expired in december 2009 stock repurchases under this program were funded from working capital 

while several measures have indicated that the economy may be improving the economic environment remains fragile during 2010 we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results

 critical accounting estimates and risks 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixedbid contracts the allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes valuation of investments goodwill and other longlived assets assumptions used in valuing stockbased compensation arrangements contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts which are predominantly fixedprice contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting under this method total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost cost to cost method this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first 

  

becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations contract losses for all periods presented were immaterial 

stockbased compensation  utilizing the fair value recognition provisions prescribed by the authoritative guidance stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised the expected volatility of our stock the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited and the expected exercise proceeds for stockbased awards subject to the indian fringe benefit tax if applicable in addition for performance stock units we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period if actual results differ significantly from our estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance if any involves judgment as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related net interest tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred income tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

our indian subsidiaries which are referred to collectively herein as cognizant india are exportoriented companies which under the indian income tax act of 1961 are entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each software technology park or stps with respect to export profits for each stp substantially all of the earnings of cognizant india are attributable to export profits the majority of our stps in india are currently entitled to a 100 exemption from indian income tax in august 2009 the tax holidays for stps were extended by one year and are currently scheduled to expire on march 31 2011 thereafter export profits from our existing stps will be fully taxable at the indian statutory rate 3399 as of december 31 2009 in effect at such time if the tax holidays relating to our indian stps are not extended or new tax incentives are not introduced that would effectively extend the income tax holiday benefits beyond march 2011 we expect that our effective income tax rate will increase significantly beginning in calendar year 2011 in addition we expect to continue to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as special economic zones or sezs development centers operating in sezs are entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years 

  

investments  historically our investments have been in municipal debt securities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction process corporate notes and bonds debt issuances by us government agencies bank time deposits and commercial paper meeting certain criteria we evaluate our availableforsale investments periodically for possible otherthantemporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis the financial condition of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value of our availableforsale securities exceeds the fair market value of the securities and the decline in value is determined to be otherthantemporary 

determining the fair value of our investment in auctionrate securities with unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity requires judgment including determining the appropriate holding period and discount rate to be used in valuing such securities we value our investment in auctionrate securities using a discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates the following key inputs i the underlying structure of each security ii frequency and amounts of cash flows iii expected holding period for the security and iv discount rates that are believed to reflect current market conditions and the relevant risk associated with each security in estimating the holding period we considered the current developments in the auctionrate market including our ability to hold the securities for such period of time recent calls of auctionrate securities by issuers and the possible reestablishment of an active market for the auctionrate securities that we hold based upon these factors we used a holding period of five years for securities with a stated maturity beyond five years which represents the period of time we anticipate will elapse before a liquidity event could occur an increase or decrease in the holding period by two years would change the fair value of our investment in auctionrate securities by approximately 80 million we derive the discount rate by considering observable interest rate yields for bonds supported by student loans and pricing of new bond issuances and adding an illiquidity premium to such rates the illiquidity premium was estimated by management considering current market conditions as of december 31 2009 we used a weightedaverage illiquidity premium of 290 basis points this weightedaverage illiquidity premium has been impacted by overall issues within the credit and capital markets and related increases in volatility including uncertainty of the credit and money markets an increase or decrease to the illiquidity premium of 100 basis points would change the estimated fair value of our investment in auctionrate securities by approximately 60 million our valuation is also impacted by changes in market interest rates because the interest payments we receive on our auctionrate securities vary based on a predetermined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices an increase or decrease in market interest rates of 25 basis points would change the estimated fair value of our investment in auctionrate securities by approximately 50 million we anticipate there will be ongoing developments in the credit markets and the market for the auctionrate securities that we hold accordingly our estimates of the expected holding period and illiquidity premium used in valuing such securities may change in the shortterm 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative creditworthiness of each customer historical collections experience and other information including the aging of the receivables if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant when determining the fair value of our reporting units we utilize various assumptions including projections of future cash flows any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge as of december 31 2009 our goodwill balance was 1924 million 

longlived assets  we review longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in general we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future 

  

cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset if such assets were determined to be impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks the majority of our development and delivery centers including a majority of our employees are located in india as a result we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights limitations on immigration programs the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potential geopolitical and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts and potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers we are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the inability of our management and our independent auditor to provide us with reasonable assurance regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline see part i item 1a “risk factors” 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data expressed for the three years ended december 31 2009 

dollars in thousands 

 

  

    

the following table includes nongaap income from operations excluding stockbased compensation and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense a measure defined by the securities and exchange commission as a nongaap financial measure this nongaap financial measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies in addition this nongaap measure the financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and reconciliations of our gaap financial statements to such nongaap measure should be carefully evaluated 

we seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin excluding stockbased compensation costs and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 19 to 20 of revenues accordingly we believe that nongaap income from operations excluding stockbased compensation costs and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes we use financial statements that do not include stockbased compensation expense and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors moreover because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use to account for stockbased compensation expense we believe that providing a nongaap financial measure that excludes stockbased compensation expense and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies accordingly we believe that the presentation of nongaap income from operations when read in conjunction with our reported gaap income from operations can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 

a limitation of using nongaap income from operations versus income from operations reported in accordance with gaap is that nongaap income from operations excludes costs namely stockbased compensation that is recurring and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense that was repealed during the third quarter of 2009 retroactive to april 1 2009 stockbased compensation expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business in addition other companies may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than us thereby limiting the usefulness of this nongaap financial measure as a comparative tool we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from nongaap income from operations and evaluating such nongaap financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap 

a reconciliation of income from operations as reported and nongaap income from operations excluding stockbased compensation expense and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense is as follows for the years ended december 31 

dollars in thousands 

 

 the fringe benefit tax regulation in india obligated us to pay upon exercise or distribution of shares under a stockbased compensation award a nonincome related tax on the appreciation of the award from date of grant to 

  

date of vest there was no cash cost to us as we recovered the cost of the indian fringe benefit tax from the employee’s proceeds from the award under us gaap the stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense is required to be recorded as an operating expense and the related recovery of such tax from our employee is required to be recorded to stockholders’ equity as proceeds from a stockbased compensation award during the third quarter of 2009 the indian government repealed the fringe benefit tax retroactive to april 1 2009 

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

revenue  revenue increased by 164 or approximately 4624 million from approximately 28163 million during 2008 to approximately 32787 million in 2009 this increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the global delivery model among an increasing number of industries continued interest in using the global delivery model as a means to reduce overall it costs and greater penetration in the european market revenue from customers existing as of december 31 2008 increased by approximately 3759 million and revenue from new customers added since december 31 2008 was approximately 865 million or approximately 26 of total revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 in addition revenue from our north american and european customers increased in 2009 by 3659 million and 657 million respectively as compared to 2008 we had approximately 589 active clients as of december 31 2009 as compared to approximately 565 active clients as of december 31 2008 in addition we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services our financial services and healthcare business segments accounted for approximately 1226 million and 1722 million respectively of the 4624 million increase in revenue additionally our it consulting and technology services and it outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 102 and 219 respectively compared to 2008 and represented approximately 444 and 556 respectively of total revenues in 2009

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries incentivebased compensation stockbased compensation expense and related stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense employee benefits travel promotion communications management finance administrative and occupancy costs selling general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization increased by approximately 115 or 839 million from 7268 million during 2008 to 8107 million during 2009 and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 258 in 2008 to 247 in 2009 the decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar economies of scale driven by increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization reductions in discretionary spending partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation depreciation and amortization expense and expenses related to the expansion of our infrastructure to support our revenue growth 

income from operations  income from operations increased approximately 197 or 1018 million from approximately 5167 million during 2008 to approximately 6185 million during 2009 representing operating margins of approximately 189 of revenues in 2009 and 183 of revenues in 2008 the operating margin increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar and achieving operating efficiencies as a result of revenue growth outpacing our headcount growth partially 

  

offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs including incentivebased compensation costs and investments to grow our business excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 255 basis points or 255 percentage points each additional 10 change in the exchange rate between the indian rupee and the us dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 24 basis points or 024 percentage points excluding stockbased compensation expense and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 458 million in 2009 and 520 million in 2008 operating margins for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 were 203 and 202 respectively 

we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain salary payments in india these hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the indian rupee during 2009 these cash flow hedges favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 27 basis points or 027 percentage points 

other income expense net other income expense net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses and interest income the following table sets forth for the periods indicated other income expense net 

dollars in thousands 

 

 the foreign currency exchange gains of approximately 225 million were primarily attributed to i us dollar denominated intercompany payables from our european subsidiaries to cognizant india for services performed by cognizant india on behalf of our european customers and ii the remeasurement of the indian rupee net monetary assets on cognizant india’s books to the us dollar functional currency the 208 million of losses on foreign exchange forward contracts were related to the change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to indian rupee denominated net monetary assets at december 31 2009 the notional value of these undesignated hedges was 4000 million the 63 million decrease in interest income was due to lower average shortterm interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008 the increase in other income expense net of 17 million primarily relates to gains on redemptions of certain auctionrate securities offset by the net change in fair value of our auctionrate securities and the related ubs right

net income  net income increased from approximately 4308 million in 2008 to approximately 5350 million in 2009 representing 153 and 163 of revenues respectively the increase in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2009 is primarily attributed to a higher operating margin and foreign currency exchange gains partially offset by lower interest income

results by business segment 

our reportable segments are financial services which includes customers providing banking  transaction processing capital markets and insurance services healthcare which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers manufacturingretaillogistics which includes manufacturers retailers travel and other hospitality customers as well as customers providing logistics services and other which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which individually are less than 100 of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit the other segment includes entertainment media and information services communications and high technology operating segments our sales managers account executives account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve 

our chief operating decision maker evaluates cognizant’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers certain expenses such as general and administrative and a portion of depreciation and amortization are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment further stockbased compensation expense and the related stockbased indian fringe benefit tax are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed in note 14 as “unallocated” and are adjusted only against the total income from operations 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 589 active customers accordingly we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment however no individual customer exceeded 100 of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues 

  

revenues from external customers and segment operating profit before unallocated expenses for the financial services healthcare manufacturingretaillogistics and other segments for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 are as follows

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2009 we had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 13993 million we have used and plan to use such cash for i expansion of existing operations including our offshore development and delivery centers ii continued development of new service lines iii acquisitions of businesses iv formation of joint ventures v stock repurchases and vi general corporate purposes including working capital as of december 31 2009 we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately 16610 million as compared to working capital of approximately 10805 million as of december 31 2008 accordingly we do not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues 

net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 6723 million for the year ended december 31 2009 4297 million for the year ended december 31 2008 and 3443 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase in 2009 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2009 and higher incentive based compensation accruals which are paid subsequent to year end trade accounts receivable increased from approximately 3830 million at december 31 2007 to approximately 5175 million at december 31 2008 and to approximately 6263 million at december 31 2009 unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately 535 million at december 31 2007 to approximately 622 at december 31 2008 and to approximately 830 million at december 31 2009 the increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2009 was due primarily to increased revenues and a higher number of days of sales outstanding we monitor turnover aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff at december 31 2009 our days sales outstanding including unbilled receivables was approximately 72   days as compared to 71 days as of december 31 2008 and 67 days as of december 31 2007 

our investing activities used net cash of approximately 3948 million for the year ended december 31 2009 550 million for the year ended december 31 2008 and 2773 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2009 primarily related to net purchases of shortterm investments and increased payments for acquisitions offset by a decrease in capital expenditures to coincide with the change in demand driven by the overall economic conditions the decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2008 primarily related to decreased payments for acquisitions and the net effect of the sale of a portion of our auctionrate securities investments and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds into cash and cash equivalents during the year 

our financing activities provided net cash of approximately 769 million for the year ended december 31 2009 440 million for the year ended december 31 2008 and 40 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase in 2009 related to additional proceeds and excess tax benefits from issuances under our stockbased compensation plans and lower common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program the increase in 2008 related primarily to lower common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and lower proceeds and excess tax benefits from issuances under our stockbased compensation plans 

as of december 31 2009 our shortterm and longterm investments totaled 4495 million and included 1291 million in longterm of aaaa3rated auctionrate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans substantially backed by the ffelp in addition the remainder of our longterm investments included 220 million of an auctionrate securities related ubs right discussed below 

  

since february 14 2008 auctions failed for all the auctionrate securities still in our portfolio as of december 31 2009 we believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities and we continue to earn and receive interest on the auctionrate municipal debt securities at a predetermined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices all of the auctionrate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par 

in november 2008 we accepted an offer from ubs ag or ubs to sell to ubs at par value our auctionrate securities at any time during an exercise period from june 30 2010 to july 2 2012 which we refer to as the ubs right in accepting the ubs right we granted ubs the authority to purchase these auctionrate securities or sell them on our behalf at par value any time after the execution of the ubs right through july 2 2012 the offer is nontransferable during 2009 approximately 173 million of the auctionrate securities were redeemed at par value the par value of the auctionrate securities held by us at december 31 2009 was 1513 million 

based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months if a liquidity event does not occur prior to the exercise period under the ubs right we expect to obtain liquidity through the ubs right if ubs is unable to honor its obligations under the ubs right we believe we will be able to ultimately recover our investment in auctionrate municipal debt securities due to i the strength of the underlying collateral substantially backed by ffelp and ii the aaa credit rating of the securities held by us however it could take until the final maturity of the underlying security up to 32 years to realize our investments’ recorded value 

our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our longterm capital requirements beyond a 12month period will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from india and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we cannot be certain that additional financing if required will be available on terms favorable to us if at all we expect our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months 

commitments and contingencies 

our current india real estate development program now includes planned construction of approximately 45 million square feet of new space the expanded program which commenced during the quarter ended march 31 2007 includes the expenditure of approximately 3300 million on land acquisition facilities construction and furnishings to build new stateoftheart development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as sezs located in india as of december 31 2009 we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately 359 million related to our india development center expansion program 

as of december 31 2009 we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

  

    

in connection with a 2008 acquisition additional purchase price not to exceed 140 million payable in 2010 is contingent on the acquired company achieving certain financial and operating targets during an earnout period we expect to fund such payment if any from operating cash flow the ultimate amount payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because the amount is dependent on future results of operations of the acquired business in accordance with us gaap we have not recorded a liability for this item on our balance sheet because the definitive amount is not determinable or distributable the contingent consideration if paid will be recorded as an additional element of the cost of the acquired company 

as of december 31 2009 we had 106 million of unrecognized tax benefits this represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution the resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management the outcome of such claims and legal actions if decided adversely is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results cash flows or consolidated financial position additionally many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our clients including any breach involving a customer’s confidential information or sensitive data or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our services there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results financial position and cash flows 

foreign currency risk 

overall we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as approximately 791 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 were generated from customers located in north america however a portion of our costs in india representing approximately 275 of our global operating costs for the year ended december 31 2009 were denominated in the indian rupee and were subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations these foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations in addition a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may result in nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement in 2009 we reported foreign currency exchange gains exclusive of hedging gains or losses of approximately 225 million which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of i us dollar denominated intercompany payables from our european subsidiaries to cognizant india for services performed by cognizant india on behalf of our european customers and ii indian rupee net monetary assets on cognizant india’s books to the us dollar functional currency on an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the indian rupee in our indian subsidiaries 

during december 2008 and throughout 2009 we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses including salaries these us dollar  indian rupee hedges to buy indian rupees and sell us dollars are intended to partially offset the impact of 

  

movement of exchange rates on future operating costs during 2009 we reported income of 89 million on contracts that settled during the year as of december 31 2009 we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of 4500 million and weighted average forward rate of 4944 rupees to the us dollar scheduled to mature in 2010 and outstanding contracts with a notional value of 3600 million and weighted average forward rate of 4849 rupees to the us dollar scheduled to mature in 2011 

we also use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to our indian rupee denominated net monetary assets these contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange rate gains or losses upon the remeasurement of the underlying indian rupee denominated net monetary assets during 2009 we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2010 to buy us dollars and sell indian rupees at december 31 2009 the notional value of the outstanding contracts was 4000 million and the related fair value was a liability of 208 million during 2009 inclusive of the loss of 208 million on these undesignated balance sheet hedges we reported net foreign currency exchange gains of approximately 17 million 

there were no offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2009 2008 and 2007 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources 

effects of inflation 

our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals competition in india the united states and europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform the services we offer has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation as with other service providers in our industry we must adequately anticipate wage increases particularly on our fixedprice contracts there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the united states and elsewhere historically we have experienced wage inflation in india however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as indian wages represented less than 200 of our total operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2009 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance which defines fair value establishes a marketbased framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements it is appropriate to apply fair value measurements whenever other sections of the authoritative guidance requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value this authoritative guidance does not expand or require any new fair value measures however the application of this guidance may change current practice we adopted this authoritative guidance for financial assets and liabilities effective january 1 2008 and for nonfinancial assets and liabilities effective january 1 2009 the adoption of this authoritative guidance which primarily affected the valuation of our investments and derivative contracts did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

in april 2009 the fasb issued several amendments to the accounting and disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities these amendments are intended to provide guidance to 

 

  

   

  

 we elected to early adopt these amendments effective march 31 2009 the adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

in december 2007 the fasb revised the authoritative guidance for business combinations which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction whether a full or partial acquisition establishes the acquisitiondate fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires expensing of transaction and restructuring costs and requires the acquirer to disclose the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination effective january 1 2009 we adopted this revised guidance which applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january 1 2009 the adoption of this revised guidance did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition however the impact of this revised guidance on our future consolidated financial statements will depend upon the nature terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate in the future 

in march 2008 the fasb issued authoritative guidance which applies to all derivative instruments and related hedged items accounted for as hedges this guidance requires entities to provide greater transparency about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under this guidance and its related interpretations and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position results of operations and cash flows effective january 1 2009 we adopted this guidance and have presented the required information in note 11 

in may 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance establishing principles and requirements for recognition and disclosure of subsequent events in the financial statements our adoption of this guidance on june 30 2009 did not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations 

in june 2009 the fasb issued a new accounting standard which changes the consolidation rules as they relate to variable interest entities specifically the new standard makes significant changes to the model for determining who should consolidate a variable interest entity and also addresses how often this assessment should be performed this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2009 the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations 

in june 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance “the fasb accounting standards codification and hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles—a replacement of fasb statement no 162” the “codification” the codification does not alter current us gaap but rather integrates existing accounting standards with other authoritative guidance under the codification there is a single source of authoritative us gaap for nongovernmental entities and it supersedes all other previously issued nonsec accounting and reporting guidance the codification is effective for financial statement periods ending after september 15 2009 our adoption of the codification on july 1 2009 did not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations 

in october 2009 the fasb issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables specifically the new standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the 

  

inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices in the absence of the vendorspecific objective evidence or thirdparty evidence of the selling prices consideration must be allocated to the deliverables based on management’s best estimate of the selling prices in addition the new standard eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation in october 2009 the fasb also issued a new accounting standard which changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software and hardware elements specifically tangible products containing software and hardware that function together to deliver the tangible products’ essential functionality are scoped out of the existing software revenue recognition guidance and will be accounted for under the multipleelement arrangements revenue recognition guidance discussed above both standards will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2011 early adoption is permitted the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures 

we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses including salaries these us dollar  indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 the notional value of these contracts was 8100 million and 820 million respectively the outstanding contracts at december 31 2009 are scheduled to mature each month during 2010 and 2011 at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 the net unrealized gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was 190 million and 06 million respectively based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2009 which estimates the fair value of the contracts based 

  

upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 800 million 

we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to our indian rupee denominated net monetary assets these contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange rate gains or losses upon the remeasurement of the underlying indian rupee denominated net monetary assets during 2009 we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2010 to buy us dollars and sell indian rupees at december 31 2009 the notional value of the outstanding contracts was 4000 million and the related fair value was a liability of 208 million based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2009 which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 420 million 

there were no offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2009 2008 and 2007 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources 

we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 15505 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments most of which are impacted almost immediately by changes in shortterm interest rates we limit our credit risk by investing primarily in aaaaaaa3 or a1p1 rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s and fitch rating services and restricting amounts that can be invested with any single issuer 

as of december 31 2009 our shortterm and longterm investments totaled 4495 million and included 1291 million in longterm of aaaa3rated auctionrate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans substantially backed by the ffelp in addition the remainder of our longterm investments included 220 million of an auctionrate related ubs right discussed below since february 14 2008 auctions failed for all the auctionrate securities still in our portfolio as of december 31 2009 we believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities and we continue to earn and receive interest on the auctionrate municipal debt securities at a predetermined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices all of the auctionrate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par 

in november 2008 we accepted an offer from ubs to sell to ubs at par value our auctionrate securities at any time during an exercise period from june 30 2010 to july 2 2012 which we refer to as the ubs right in accepting the ubs right we granted ubs the authority to purchase these auctionrate securities or sell them on our behalf at par value any time after the execution of the ubs right through july 2 2012 the offer is nontransferable at december 31 2009 we determined the fair value of the ubs right to be 220 million during 2009 approximately 173 million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par value

industry background 

many companies today face intense competitive pressure and rapidly changing market dynamics driven by such factors as changes in government regulations globalization changes in the economy and technology innovation in response to these challenges many companies are focused on improving productivity increasing service levels lowering costs and accelerating delivery times in order to achieve these goals companies are focusing on a number of technologycentric areas such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these approaches and technologies facilitate faster more responsive lowercost business operations however their development integration and ongoing maintenance present major challenges and require a large number of highly skilled professionals trained in many diverse technologies in addition companies also require additional technical resources to maintain enhance and reengineer their core legacy it systems and to address application maintenance projects increasingly companies are relying on custom it solutions providers such as us to provide these services 

in order to respond effectively to a changing and challenging business environment it departments of many companies have focused increasingly on improving returns on it investments lowering costs and accelerating the delivery of new systems and solutions to accomplish these objectives many it departments have shifted all or a portion of their it development integration and maintenance requirements to outside service providers operating with onsiteoffshore business models 

global demand for high quality lower cost it services from outside providers has created a significant opportunity for it service providers that can successfully leverage the benefits of and address the challenges in 

  

using an offshore talent pool the effective use of offshore personnel can offer a variety of benefits including lower costs faster delivery of new it solutions and innovations in vertical solutions processes and technologies certain countries particularly india and china have large talent pools of highly qualified technical professionals that can provide high quality it and business processing outsourcing bpo services at a lower cost india is a leader in it services and is regarded as having one of the largest and highest quality pools of talent in the world historically it service providers have used offshore labor pools primarily to supplement the internal staffing needs of customers however evolving customer demands have led to the increasing acceptance and use of offshore resources for higher valueadded services these services include application design development testing integration and maintenance as well as technology consulting and infrastructure management india’s services and software exports continue to see significant growth in early 2009 nasscom india’s national association of software and service companies reports stated that india’s it software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to reach an estimated 47 billion by the end of the fiscal year march 31 2009 this is an expected growth rate of approximately 16 to 17 over the prior year 

using a globally distributed workforce to provide valueadded services presents a number of challenges to it service providers the offshore implementation of valueadded it services requires that it service providers continually and effectively attract train and retain highly skilled software development professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences these skills are necessary to design develop and deploy highquality technology solutions in a costeffective and timely manner in addition it service providers must have the methodologies processes and communications capabilities to enable offshore workforces to be successfully integrated with onsite personnel service providers must also have strong research and development capabilities technology competency centers and relationship management skills in order to compete effectively 

the cognizant approach 

our business is organized and managed primarily around our four verticallyoriented business segments 

 

  

  

  

 this vertical focus has been central to our revenue growth and high customer satisfaction as the it services industry continues to mature clients are looking for service providers who understand their businesses industry initiatives culture and have solutions tailored to meet their individual business needs we have continued to hire experts out of industry establish a broad base of business analysts invest in industry training for our staff and build out industryspecific services and solutions this approach is central to our highlevels of ontime delivery and customer satisfaction as we understand the full context of our clients’ challenges and have deep experience in addressing them

the other business segment is an aggregation of operating segments which individually are less than 100 of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit the other business segment includes communications media and information services and high technology operating segments in 2008 our other business segment represented approximately 142 of our total revenues a description of operating segments included in other is as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our solution and services 

we believe that we have developed an effective integrated global delivery business model and that this business model will be a critical element of our continued growth to support this business model at december 31 2008 we employed approximately 61700 it professionals and support staff globally we also have established facilities and technology and communication infrastructures to support our business model 

across each of our business segments we provide a broad and expanding range of consulting information technology and business process outsourcing services including 

consulting and technology services 

 

   

  

  

  

 in both of these approaches our onsite team members work closely and collaboratively with our clients detailed design implementation and testing are generally performed offshore at our 45 it development centers located in india china argentina and hungary as well as in bentonville ar boston ma bridgewater nj chicago il phoenix az amsterdam and toronto in addition we maintain an onsite presence at each customer location in order to address evolving customer needs and resulting changes to the project 

a key part of our application development and integration offering is a suite of services to help organizations build and integrate business applications with the rest of their operations in this suite of services we leverage our skills in business application development and enterprise application integration to build sophisticated business applications and to integrate these new applications and websites with client server and legacy systems we build and deploy robust scalable and extensible architectures for use in a wide range of industries we maintain competency centers specializing in microsoft ibm sap oracle and java applications among others in order to be able to provide application development and integration services to a broad spectrum of customers 

our reengineering service offerings assist customers migrating from systems based on legacy computing environments to newer standardsbased distribution architectures often in response to the more stringent demands of business our reengineering tools automate many of the processes required to implement advanced technology platforms we believe that this automation substantially reduces the time and cost to perform reengineering services savings that benefit both us and our customers these tools also enable us to perform source code analysis and to redesign target databases and convert certain programming languages if necessary our programmers also help customers redesign and convert user interfaces 

 

   

outsourcing services 

 

 we provide services to help ensure that a customer’s core operational systems are free of defects and responsive to the customer’s changing needs as part of this process we are often able to introduce product and process enhancements and improve service levels to customers requesting modifications and ongoing support 

our global delivery business model enables us to provide a range of rapid response and costeffective support services to our customers our onsite team members often provide helpdesk services at the customer’s facility these team members typically carry pagers in the event of an emergency service request and are available to quickly resolve customer problems from remote locations in the case of more complex maintenance services including modifications enhancements and documentation which typically have longer turnaround times we take full advantage of our offshore resources to develop solutions more costeffectively than would be possible relying on higher cost local professionals the services provided by our offshore team members are delivered to customers using satellite and fiberoptic communications 

as part of our application maintenance services we assist customers in renovating their core systems to meet the requirements imposed by new regulations new standards or other external events these services include or have previously included year 2000 compliance eurocurrency compliance decimalization within the securities industry and compliance with the health insurance portability and accountability act for the healthcare industry 

we seek to anticipate the operational environment of our customers’ it systems as we design and develop such systems we also offer diagnostic services to customers to assist them in identifying shortcomings in their it systems and optimizing the performance of their systems 

 

  

 in addition to our industryspecific expertise and focus our strengths which we believe differentiate us from other it service providers include the following 

established and scalable proprietary processes we have a comprehensive process framework that addresses the entire software engineering life cycle and support activities which is scalable for projects of different sizes and complexities this proprietary framework which we refer to as “process space” previously qview is supported by inhouse project management metrics management and workflow tools and is available to all onsite and offshore programmers process space has evolved since its original release in 1996 

  

in breadth depth and maturity based on the implementation feedback from projects and findings of internal quality audits and external assessments process capabilities are monitored at the subprocess level and performance targets are monitored at the process level which are aligned with the overall business objectives statistical process controls are used extensively to continuously monitor predict and improve performance our quality assurance group facilitates process implementation from the project inception and audits the projects periodically to ensure that the implementation is effective and the risks are being managed 

our process framework complies with the requirements of iso 9001 tl 9000 for telecom projects and iso 20000 for infrastructure projects our delivery processes support processes and their implementation are formally certified by dnv det norske veritas in the above mentioned standards kpmg appraises our enterprisewide operations to be at cmmi maturity level 5 which is the highest possible maturity level rating of the capability maturity model integration v12 cmmi of the software engineering institute at carnegie mellon university our bpo service offering is assessed at escm maturity level 4 which is the highest possible rating for the first attempt of the esourcing capability model of it services qualification center at carnegie melon university finally all of our principal development centers have been certified by the stqc directorate ministry of communications and information technology government of india the accreditation authority for companies in india under the internationally recognized iso 27001 previously bs 77992 information security standards a comprehensive set of controls comprising best practices in information security and business continuity planning we have implemented the above process framework enterprisewide to ensure that we consistently deliver high quality of products and services to our clients from all global operations we have invested considerably to develop a number of software automation tools designed to improve process institutionalization for example we have created and rolled out over the past 2 years “cognizant 20” this is an intelligent delivery ecosystem which orchestrates across the organization best practice methodologies and the collaboration and archival of knowledge cognizant 20 has already been rolled out over significant number of projects and is quickly becoming a one stop shop for all project management metrics and knowledge management cognizant 20 gradually replaces the existing set of internally developed tools such as prolite etracker and qsmart 

our process framework has been extensively adapted to cater to different types of projects managed by the organization including application development application maintenance testing mass change data migration reengineering business process outsourcing it infrastructure and package development projects 

highly skilled workforce our managers and senior technical personnel provide indepth project management expertise to customers to maintain this level of expertise we have placed significant emphasis on recruiting and training our workforce of highly skilled professionals we have over 6800 project managers and senior technical personnel around the world many of whom have significant work experience in north america europe and asia we also maintain programs and personnel to hire and train the best available technical professionals in both legacy systems and emerging technologies we provide five months of combined classroom and onthejob training to newly hired programmers as well as additional annual training programs designed to enhance the business practices tools technology and consulting skills of our professional staff we were assessed by kpmg at level 5 the highest possible rating of the people capability maturity model pcmm of the software engineering institute at carnegie mellon university this widely recognized means of implementing current best practices in fields such as human resources knowledge management and organizational development help improve our processes for managing and developing our workforce and addressing critical people issues 

research and development and competency centers  we have project experience and expertise across multiple architectures and technologies and have made significant investments in our competency centers and in research and development to keep abreast of the latest technology developments most of our programmers are trained in multiple technologies and architectures as a result we are able to react to customers’ needs quickly and efficiently redeploy programmers to different technologies also to develop and maintain this flexibility we have made a substantial investment in our competency centers so that the experience gained from particular 

  

projects and research and development efforts is leveraged across our entire organization in addition through our investment in research and development activities and the continuing education of our technical personnel we enlarge our knowledge base and develop the necessary skills to keep pace with emerging technologies we believe that our ability to work in new technologies allows us to foster longterm relationships by having the capacity to continually address the needs of both existing and new customers 

welldeveloped infrastructure our extensive facilities technology and communications infrastructure facilitate the seamless integration of our onsite and offshore workforces this is accomplished by permitting team members in different locations to access common project information and to work directly on customer projects this infrastructure allows for 

 

  

  

  

 international time differences enable our offshore teams to access a customer’s computing facilities located in north america europe and the asia pacific region during offpeak hours this ability to perform services during offpeak hours enables us to complete projects more rapidly and does not require our customers to invest in duplicative hardware and software in addition for large projects with short time frames our offshore facilities allow for parallel processing of various development phases to accelerate delivery time in addition we can deliver services more rapidly than some competitors without an offshore labor pool because our lower labor costs enable us to costeffectively assign more professionals to a project 

business strategies 

our objectives are to maximize stockholder value and enhance our position as a leading provider of custom it services we implement the following core strategies to achieve these objectives 

further develop longterm customer relationships we have strong longterm strategic relationships with our customers and business partners we seek to establish longterm relationships that present recurring revenue opportunities frequently trying to establish relationships with our customers’ chief information officers or other it decision makers by offering a wide array of costeffective high quality services approximately 95 of our revenues in the year ended december 31 2008 were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2007 we also seek to leverage our experience with a customer’s it systems into new business opportunities knowledge of a customer’s processes and it systems gained during the performance of application maintenance services for example may provide us with a competitive advantage in securing additional development and maintenance projects from that customer 

expand service offerings and solutions we have several teams dedicated to developing new high value services these teams collaborate with customers to develop these services for example we are currently developing new offerings in business and it consulting and verticallyoriented it solutions atop innovative technologies such as service oriented architectures soa and web 20 we invest in internal research and development and promote knowledge building and sharing across the organization to promote the development of new services and solutions furthermore we continue to enhance our capabilities and service offerings in the areas of 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 we believe that the continued expansion of our service offerings will reduce our reliance on any one technology initiative and will help foster longterm relationships with our customers by allowing us to serve their needs better 

enhance processes methodologies and productivity toolsets we are committed to improving and enhancing our proprietary process space software engineering process and other methodologies and toolsets in light of the rapid evolution of technology we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our continued success we are constantly designing and developing additional productivity software tools to automate testing processes and improve project estimation and risk assessment techniques for example in the past two years we have created and rolled out “cognizant 20” which uses groupware technology based on web 20 technologies enabling cognizant associates to share project experiences and best practice methodologies across the organization with the objective of improving productivity 

expand domestic and international geographic presence  as we expand our customer base we plan to open additional sales and marketing offices in north america europe latin america and asia this expansion is expected to facilitate sales and service to existing and new customers we have established sales and marketing offices in atlanta ga boston ma bridgewater nj chicago il dallas tx minneapolis mn phoenix az los angeles ca norwalk ct san francisco ca and teaneck nj in addition we have been pursuing market opportunities internationally through our offices in amsterdam buenos aires chennai cyberjaya malaysia frankfurt london melbourne paris shanghai singapore tokyo toronto and zurich 

continue to be an employer of choice in the industry as a rapidly growing professional services firm a key attribute of our continued success is an ability to continually hire assimilate motivate and retain the best talent possible in the industry we have developed strong relationships with key universities around the world particularly in india to provide a continual funnel of talented staff from tier one schools in addition we continue to expand our presence and brand in our key supply markets further enhancing our ability to hire experienced professionals from competing it services firms and industry to support our client needs and growth we invest heavily in training programs centered around cognizant academy motivational programs and career development to ensure personal professional growth for each of our associates 

pursue selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances  we believe that opportunities exist in the fragmented it services market to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances we believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence and our capabilities more rapidly especially in geographic markets and key industries for example in 2008 we completed two acquisitions to strengthen our it consulting in the media and entertainment industry and enhance our service delivery capabilities in india in addition through our working relationships with independent software vendors we obtain projects using the detailed knowledge we gain in connection with a joint development process finally we will continue to strategically partner with select it service firms that offer complementary services to best meet the requirements of our customers 

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our services directly through our professional staff senior management and direct sales personnel operating out of our teaneck new jersey headquarters and our business development offices located in atlanta ga boston ma bridgewater nj chicago il dallas tx los angeles ca minneapolis mn norwalk ct phoenix az san francisco ca teaneck nj amsterdam buenos aires chennai cyberjaya malaysia frankfurt london melbourne paris shanghai singapore tokyo toronto and zurich 

  

at december 31 2008 we had 78 direct sales persons and 724 account managers and client partners the sales and marketing group works with our technical team as the sales process moves closer to the customer’s selection of a services provider the duration of the sales process varies depending on the type of service ranging from approximately two months to over one year the account manager or sales executive works with the technical team to 

 

  

  

  

 management reviews and approves proposals which are then presented to the prospective customer our sales and account management personnel remain actively involved in the project through the execution phase we focus our marketing efforts on businesses with intensive information processing needs we maintain a prospectcustomer database that is continuously updated and used throughout the sales cycle from prospect qualification to close as a result of this marketing system we prequalify sales opportunities and direct sales representatives are able to minimize the time spent on prospect qualification in addition substantial emphasis is placed on customer retention and expansion of services provided to existing customers in this regard our account managers play an important marketing role by leveraging their ongoing relationship with the customer to identify opportunities to expand and diversify the type of services provided to that customer 

customers 

the number of customers served by us has increased significantly in recent years as of december 31 2008 we were providing services to approximately 565 customers as compared to approximately 500 customers as of december 31 2007 and 400 customers as of december 31 2006 accordingly we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment however no individual customer exceeded 100 of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues 

for the year ended december 31 2008 we derived our revenues from the following business segments 456 from financial services 244 from healthcare 158 from retailmanufacturinglogistics and 142 from other 

we provide services either on a timeandmaterial basis or on a fixed price basis the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a significant customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highly skilled it development professionals in particular we need to attract train and retain project managers programmers and other senior technical personnel we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for it development professionals in the united states and in india with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer we have an active recruitment program in india and have developed a recruiting system and database that facilitates the rapid identification of skilled candidates during the course of the year we conduct extensive recruiting efforts at premier colleges and technical schools in india we evaluate candidates based on academic performance the results of a written aptitude test measuring problemsolving skills and a technical interview in addition we have an active lateral recruiting program in north america europe and india a substantial majority of the personnel on most onsite teams and virtually all the personnel staffed on offshore teams is comprised of indian nationals

corporate history 

we began our it development and maintenance services business in early 1994 as an inhouse technology development center for the dun  bradstreet corporation and its operating units in 1996 we along with certain other entities were spunoff from the dun  bradstreet corporation to form a new company cognizant corporation on june 24 1998 we completed an initial public offering of our class a common stock on june 30 1998 a majority interest in us and certain other entities were spunoff from cognizant corporation to form ims health subsequently cognizant corporation was renamed nielsen media research incorporated 

on january 30 2003 we filed a tender offer in which ims health stockholders could exchange ims health shares held by them for our class b common stock held by ims health on february 13 2003 ims health distributed all of our class b common stock that ims health owned in an exchange offer to its stockholders on february 21 2003 pursuant to the terms of our restated certificate of incorporation all of the shares of class b common stock automatically converted into shares of class a common stock since february 21 2003 there have been no outstanding shares of class b common stock effective may 26 2004 pursuant to the certificate of amendment to restated certificate of incorporation there are no authorized shares of class b common stock

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the risks and uncertainties detailed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india and we are subject to regulatory economic and political uncertainties in india 

we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india where a majority of our technical professionals are located while wage costs are lower in india than in the united states and other developed countries for comparably skilled professionals wages in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states which could result in our incurring increased costs for technical professionals and reduced operating margins in addition there is intense competition in india for skilled technical professionals and we expect that competition to increase 

india has also recently experienced civil unrest and terrorism and has been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries in recent years there have been military confrontations between india and pakistan that have occurred in the region of kashmir and along the indiapakistan border the potential for hostilities between the two countries has been high in light of tensions related to recent terrorist incidents in india and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment including events in and related to afghanistan and iraq if india were to become engaged in armed hostilities particularly if these hostilities were protracted or involved the threat of or use of weapons of mass destruction our operations would be materially adversely affected in addition companies may decline to contract with us for services in light of international terrorist incidents or armed hostilities even where india is not involved because of more generalized concerns about relying on a service provider utilizing international resources 

in the past the indian economy has experienced many of the problems confronting the economies of developing countries including high inflation erratic gross domestic product growth and shortages of foreign 

  

exchange the indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy and indian government actions concerning the economy could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities including us in the past the indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy including the software development services industry programs that have benefited us include among others tax holidays liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation notwithstanding these benefits india’s central and state governments remain significantly involved in the indian economy as regulators in recent years the indian government has introduced nonincome related taxes including the fringe benefit tax and new service taxes and incomerelated taxes including the minimum alternative tax a change in government leadership in india or change in polices of the existing government in india that results in the elimination of any of the benefits realized by us from our indian operations or the imposition of new taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in the united states and europe as well as on clients concentrated in certain industries including the financial services industry continuing or worsening economic conditions or factors that negatively affect the economic health of the united states europe or these industries may adversely affect our business 

approximately 791 of our revenues during the year ended december 31 2008 were derived from customers located in north america in the same period approximately 192 of our revenues were derived from customers located in europe if the united states or european economy continues to weaken or slow and conditions in the financial markets continue to deteriorate pricing for our services may be depressed and our customers may reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability additionally any prolonged recession in the united states and europe could have an adverse impact on our revenues because a large portion of our revenues are derived from the united states and europe in addition during the year ended december 31 2008 we earned approximately 456 of our revenues from the financial services and insurance industries the current crisis in the financial services industry and significant consolidation in that industry or decrease in growth or consolidation in other industry segments on which we focus may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

our international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties 

revenues from customers outside north america represented approximately 209 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 and 172 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 we anticipate that revenues from customers outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence particularly in europe in addition the majority of our employees and our it development centers are located in india as a result we may be subject to risks associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may cause volatility in our reported income and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions from time to time we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate our risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in addition we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations we may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture our international expansion plans may not be successful and we may not be able to compete effectively in other countries there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the indian rupee and other foreign currency exchange rates 

although we report our operating results in us dollars a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues income from operations other income expense net and the value of balancesheet items originally denominated in other currencies during the year ended december 31 2008 the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar favorably impacted our operating margins by 119 basis points or 119 percentage points as compared to 2007 additionally we recorded foreign currency losses of 228 million during the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency rates primarily the strengthening of the us dollar against the british pound euro and indian rupee there is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations or that any efforts by us to engage in currency hedging activities would be effective in addition in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which could limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations finally as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee against the us dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency 

we face intense competition from other it service providers 

the intensely competitive it professional services market includes a large number of participants and is subject to rapid change this market includes participants from a variety of market segments including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the market also includes numerous smaller local competitors in the various geographic markets in which we operate our direct competitors who use the onsiteoffshore business model include among others infosys technologies tata consultancy services and wipro in addition many of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition some of these larger competitors such as accenture electronic data systems recently acquired by hewlettpackard company and ibm global services have offshore operations we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our current levels of profitability or growth as competitive pressures including competition for skilled it development professionals and pricing pressure from competitors employing an onsiteoffshore business model increase 

we may not be able to sustain our current level of profitability 

for the year ended december 31 2008 and the year ended december 31 2007 we had an operating margin of 183 and 179 respectively our operating margins have declined from our prior period levels as a result of the adoption on january 1 2006 of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” which requires us to record stock compensation expense for equitybased compensation 

  

awards primarily stock option grants by us in our consolidated statement of operations effective january 1 2006 in addition effective april 1 2007 the government in india imposed a fringe benefit tax on the company for the income generated upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of performance stock units and restricted stock units for employees who worked in india during the vesting period for such award although we recover the fringe benefit tax from the employee’s proceeds upon sale or vesting of the stockbased compensation award we are required under us gaap to record the fringe benefit tax as an operating expense reducing our profitability while the recovery of the fringe benefit tax by us from the employee is reported as an addition to additional paidin capital our operating margin may decline further if we experience declines in demand and pricing for our services imposition of new nonincome related taxes or due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition wages in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states which could result in us incurring increased costs for technical professionals additionally the number and type of equitybased compensation awards and the assumptions used in valuing equitybased compensation awards may change resulting in increased stock compensation expense and lower margins although we have been able to partially offset wage increases and foreign currency fluctuations through further leveraging the scale of our operating structure obtaining price increases and issuing a lower number of stock options and other equitybased compensation awards in proportion to our overall headcount we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 

our business will suffer if we fail to develop new services and enhance our existing services in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological environment 

the it services market is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions our future success will depend on our ability to develop solutions that keep pace with changes in the it services market we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing new services addressing evolving technologies on a timely or costeffective basis or if these services are developed that we will be successful in the marketplace in addition we cannot assure you that products services or technologies developed by others will not render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to remain competitive will also depend on our ability to design and implement in a timely and costeffective manner solutions for customers that both leverage their legacy systems and appropriately utilize newer technologies such as web 20 models softwareasaservice and service oriented architectures our failure to design and implement solutions in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may face difficulties in providing endtoend business solutions for our clients that could cause clients to discontinue their work with us which in turn could harm our business 

we have been expanding the nature and scope of our engagements and have added new service offerings such as it consulting business process outsourcing systems integration and outsourcing of entire portions of it infrastructure the success of these service offerings is dependent in part upon continued demand for such services by our existing and new clients and our ability to meet this demand in a costcompetitive and effective manner in addition our ability to effectively offer a wider breadth of endtoend business solutions depends on our ability to attract existing or new clients to these service offerings to obtain engagements for such endtoend solutions we also are more likely to compete with large wellestablished international consulting firms resulting in increased competition and marketing costs accordingly we cannot be certain that our new service offerings will effectively meet client needs or that we will be able to attract existing and new clients to these service offerings 

the increased breadth of our service offerings may result in larger and more complex projects with our clients this will require us to establish closer relationships with our clients and a thorough understanding of their operations our ability to establish such relationships will depend on a number of factors including the 

  

proficiency of our it professionals and our management personnel our failure to understand our client requirements or our failure to deliver services which meet the requirements specified by our clients could result in termination of client contracts and we could be liable to our clients for significant penalties or damages 

larger projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements these terminations cancellations or delays may result from the business or financial condition of our clients or the economy generally as opposed to factors related to the quality of our services such cancellations or delays make it difficult to plan for project resource requirements and inaccuracies in such resource planning may have a negative impact on our profitability 

our results of operations may be affected by the rate of growth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of technology spending by our clients 

our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients and their customers and suppliers in challenging economic environments our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities at the same time many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel processes and infrastructures if the growth of use of technology in business or our clients’ spending on technology in business declines or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new technology solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected 

competition for highly skilled technical personnel is intense and the success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled professionals 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highly skilled it development professionals in particular we need to attract train and retain project managers it engineers and other senior technical personnel we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for it development professionals in the united states europe and india with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer we have subcontracted to a limited extent in the past and may do so in the future with other service providers in order to meet our obligations to our customers our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend in large part on our ability to attract train and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences further we must train and manage our growing work force requiring an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel we cannot assure you that the management skills and systems currently in place will be adequate or that we will be able to train and assimilate new employees successfully our failure to attract train and retain current or future employees could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our growth may be hindered by immigration restrictions 

our future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills from developing countries especially india the vast majority of our it professionals in the united states and in europe are indian nationals the ability of indian nationals to work in the united states and europe depends on their ability and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits 

the h1b visa classification enables us employers to hire qualified foreign workers in positions that require an education at least equal to a fouryear bachelor degree in the united states in specialty occupations such as it systems engineering and systems analysis the h1b visa usually permits an individual to work and live in the united states for a period of up to six years under certain circumstances h1b visa extensions after 

  

the sixyear period may be available there is a limit on the number of new h1b petitions that united states citizenship and immigration services or cis one of the successor agencies to the immigration and naturalization service may approve in any federal fiscal year and in years in which this limit is reached we may be unable to obtain h1b visas necessary to bring foreign employees to the united states currently the limit is 65000 for holders of united states or united statesequivalent bachelor degrees the general cap and an additional 20000 for holders of advanced degrees from united states postsecondary educational institutions for fiscal year 2009 cis reached its general cap as well as its cap for united states advanced degree holders on april 8 2008 we will be able to file h1b petitions with cis against the fiscal year 2010 caps beginning april 1 2009 for work in h1b status beginning on october 1 2010 however as a part of our advanced planning process we believe that we have sufficient employees visaready to meet our anticipated business growth in the current year in addition there are strict labor regulations associated with the h1b visa classification larger users of the h1b visa program are often subject to investigations by the wage and hour division of the united states department of labor a finding by the united states department of labor of willful or substantial failure by us to comply with existing regulations on the h1b classification may result in backpay liability substantial fines andor a ban on future use of the h1b program and other immigration benefits we are currently subject to such an investigation as described in the immediately following risk factor 

we also regularly transfer employees from india to the united states to work on projects and at client sites using the l1 visa classification the l1 visa allows companies abroad to transfer certain managers executives and employees with specialized company knowledge to related united states companies such as a parent subsidiary affiliate joint venture or branch office we have an approved “blanket l program” under which the corporate relationships of our transferring and receiving entities have been preapproved by cis thus enabling individual l1 visa applications to be presented directly to a visaissuing united states consular post abroad rather than undergoing the preapproval process through cis in the united states in recent years both the united states consular posts that review initial l1 applications and cis which adjudicates petitions for initial grants and extensions of l1 status have become increasingly restrictive with respect to this category as a result the rate of refusals of initial l1 petitions and of extensions has increased in addition even where l1 visas are ultimately granted and issued security measures undertaken by united states consular posts around the world have delayed visa issuances our inability to bring qualified technical personnel into the united states to staff onsite customer locations would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

on december 8 2004 president bush signed the l1 visa reform act which was part of the fiscal year 2005 omnibus appropriations act public law 108447 at division j title iv this legislation contained several important changes to the laws governing l1 visa holders all of the changes took effect on june 8 2005 under one provision of the new law all l1 applicants including those brought to the united states under a blanket l program must have worked abroad with the related company for one full year in the prior three years the provision allowing blanket l applicants who had worked abroad for the related company for six months during the qualifying threeyear period was revoked in addition l1b holders intracompany transferees with specialized company knowledge may not be primarily stationed at the work site of another employer if the l1b holder will be controlled and supervised by an employer other than the petitioning employer finally l1b status may not be granted where placement of the l1b visa holder at a third party site is part of an arrangement to provide labor for the third party rather than placement at the site in connection with the provision of a product or service involving specialized knowledge specific to the petitioning employer 

we do not place l1b workers at third party sites where they are under the primary supervision of a different employer nor do we place l1b workers at third party sites in an arrangement to provide labor for the third party without providing a service involving our specialized knowledge since implementation of the new law we consistently establish this fact to cis’s satisfaction however if cis andor the united states department of state through its visaissuing consular posts abroad decide to interpret these provisions in a very restrictive fashion this could impair our ability to staff our projects in the united states with resources from our entities abroad in addition cis has not yet issued regulations governing these statutory provisions if such 

  

regulations are restrictive in nature this could impair our ability to staff our projects in the united states with resources from our entities abroad 

we also process immigrant visas for lawful permanent residence for employees to fill positions for which there is an insufficient number of able willing and qualified united states workers available to fill the positions compliance with existing united states immigration and labor laws or changes in those laws making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting our ability to successfully obtain permanent residence for our foreign employees in the united states could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the united states any of these restrictions or limitations on our hiring practices could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to immigration restrictions in the united states there are certain restrictions on transferring employees to work in the united kingdom where cognizant has experienced significant growth the united kingdom currently requires that all employees who are not nationals of european union countries plus nationals of bulgaria and romania to obtain work permission before obtaining a visaentry clearance to travel to the united kingdom new european nationals such as hungary poland lithuania slovakia and the czech republic do not have a work permit requirement but need to obtain worker registration within 30 days of arrival on november 27 2008 the united kingdom introduced a pointsbased system under which certain certificates of sponsorship are issued by licensed employer sponsors provided the employees they seek to employ in the united kingdom can demonstrate that 1 the employee can accumulate 50 points based on attributes which include academic qualifications intended salary and other factors plus 10 points for english language not necessary where the employee is an intra company transferee and 10 points for maintenance where the employee has not worked for a cognizant group company outside the uk for at least 6 months cognizant will need to carry out a resident labor market test to confirm that the intended role cannot be filled by an eea national cognizant is an arated sponsor and was allocated a total of 9000 certificates of sponsorship accordingly cognizant anticipates that its certificate of sponsorship allocation is sufficient to meet demand for transfers to the united kingdom further as the majority of cognizant employees hold bachelor or higher level degree qualifications and meet the other points requirements generally cognizant can transfer noneea nationals to the united kingdom 

immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the united states the united kingdom and other countries are subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement immigration and work permit laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity our international expansion strategy and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with it professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed 

our results of operations and business may be affected by an investigation currently being conducted by the wage and hour division of the united states department of labor 

there are strict labor regulations associated with the h1b visa classification larger users of the h1b visa program are often subject to investigations by the wage and hour division of the united states department of labor the department of labor is conducting an investigation to determine if we have complied with the elements of the labor condition applications eta form 9035 used by us to hire certain h1b nonimmigrant workers we believe the department of labor is primarily focused on whether our employees with h1b renewals were paid at the appropriate pay level we believe this investigation will be concluded in the near term while we believe we have complied with the applicable regulations an adverse finding by the united states department of labor may result in backpay liability substantial fines andor a ban on future use of the h1b program and other immigration benefits which could potentially have a harmful effect on our business and results of operations 

  

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violations of these regulations could harm our business 

because we provide services to clients throughout the world we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal rules on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations violations of these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these laws or regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our customers 

the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest market for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by us companies are under discussion in congress and in numerous state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs in the united states while no substantive antioutsourcing legislation has been introduced to date given the ongoing debate over this issue the introduction of such legislation is possible if introduced such measures may 1 broaden restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly 2 impact private industry with measures such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions andor 3 restrict the use of certain visas in the event that any of these measures become law our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and our ability to service our customers could be impaired 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data particularly involving service providers in india current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to offshore providers to avoid negative perceptions that may be associated with using an offshore provider any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward offshore outsourcing would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide services from within the country in which our clients operate 

legislation enacted in certain european jurisdictions and any future legislation in europe japan or any other country in which we have clients restricting the performance of business process services from an offshore location could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example new legislation recently enacted in the united kingdom based on the 1977 ec acquired rights directive has been adopted in some form by many european union or eu countries and provides that if a company outsources all or part of its business to a service provider or changes its current service provider the affected employees of the company or of the previous service provider are entitled to become employees of the new service provider generally on the same terms and conditions as their original employment in addition dismissals of employees who were employed by the company or the previous service provider immediately prior to that transfer are automatically considered unfair dismissals that entitle such employees to compensation as a result in order to avoid unfair dismissal claims we may have to offer and become liable for voluntary redundancy payments to the employees of our clients who outsource business to us in the united kingdom and other eu countries who have adopted similar laws this legislation may materially affect our ability to obtain new business from companies in the united kingdom and eu and to provide outsourced services to companies in the united kingdom and eu in a costeffective manner 

  

hostilities involving the united states the united kingdom india and other countries in which we provide services to our clients and other acts of terrorism violence or war could delay or reduce the number of new service orders we receive and impair our ability to service our customers thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

hostilities involving the united states and other acts of terrorism violence or war such as the attacks of september 11 2001 in the united states the attacks of july 7 2005 in the united kingdom the attacks on november 26 2008 in mumbai india and the continuing conflict in iraq could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to service our customers hostilities involving the united states the united kingdom india and other countries in which we provide services to our clients could cause customers to delay their decisions on it spending which could affect our financial results in addition acts of terrorism violence or war could give rise to military or travel disruptions and restrictions affecting our employees as of december 31 2008 a majority of our technical professionals were located in india and the vast majority of our technical professionals in the united states and europe were indian nationals who were able to work in the united states and europe only because they held current visas and work permits travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the united states and europe 

although we continue to believe that we have a strong competitive position in the united states we continue to increase our efforts to geographically diversify our clients and revenue despite our efforts to diversify hostilities involving the united states the united kingdom india and other countries in which we provide services to our clients and other acts of terrorism violence or war may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our clients our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we maintain allowances against receivables and unbilled services actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients macroeconomic conditions such as the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system could also result in financial difficulties including limited access to the credit markets insolvency or bankruptcy for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be adversely affected 

we are investing substantial cash assets in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately 

as of december 31 2008 we had contractual commitments of approximately 553 million related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our it development centers we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability will be reduced 

  

our ability to operate and compete effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel or if we cannot attract additional qualified personnel 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of the key members of our management team as well as marketing sales and technical personnel and our ability to attract and retain new management and other personnel we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or significant employees competition for personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting and retaining new personnel in the future the loss of any one or more of our key personnel or the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

restrictions in noncompetition agreements with our executive officers may not be enforceable 

we have entered into noncompetition agreements with our executive officers we cannot assure you however that the restrictions in these agreements prohibiting such executive officers from engaging in competitive activities are enforceable further substantially all of our professional nonexecutive staff are not covered by agreements that would prohibit them from working for our competitors if any of our key professional personnel leaves our employment and joins one of our competitors our business could be adversely affected 

our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate earnings in india 

effective january 1 2002 pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 23 “accounting for income taxesspecial areas” we no longer accrue incremental us taxes on all indian earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these earnings as well as other foreign earnings for all periods are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur in the future that could effectively force us to change our intent not to repatriate our foreign earnings if we change our intent and repatriate such earnings we will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than our effective income tax rate in 2008 these increased taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in the next year we will lose certain tax benefits provided by india to companies in our industry 

our indian subsidiaries are exportoriented companies which under the indian income tax act of 1961 are entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each software technology park stp with respect to export profits for each stp substantially all of the earnings of our indian subsidiaries are attributable to export profits the majority of our stps in india are currently entitled to a 100 exemption from indian income tax under current law these tax holidays will be completely phased out by march 31 2010 under current indian tax law export profits after march 31 2010 from our existing stps will be fully taxable at the indian statutory rate 3399 as of december 31 2008 in effect at such time if the tax holidays relating to our indian stps are not extended or new tax incentives are not introduced that would effectively extend the income tax holiday benefits beyond march 31 2010 we expect that our effective income tax rate would increase significantly beginning in calendar year 2010 

in anticipation of the complete phase out of the tax holidays on march 31 2010 we expect to continue to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as special economic zones sezs development centers operating in sezs will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods of up to 15 years the indian government has proposed certain interpretive positions regarding the tax incentives applicable to sezs the indian government has discussed making further changes in the sez policies which could be adverse to our operations certain of our development centers currently operate in sezs and many of our future planned development centers are likely to operate in sezs a change in the indian government’s policies affecting sezs in a manner that adversely impacts the incentives for establishing and operating facilities in sezs could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

if our pricing structures do not accurately anticipate the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions we contract to provide services either on a timeandmaterials basis or on a fixedprice basis our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations and utilizing workforces with different skill sets and competencies across geographically distributed service locations our pricing cost and profit margin estimates for the work that we perform frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract there is a risk that we will underprice our projects fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our profit margin 

in addition a significant portion of our projects are on a fixedprice basis subjecting us to the foregoing risks to an even greater extent fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 267 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 we expect that an increasing number of our future projects will be contracted on a fixedprice basis in addition to the other risks described in the paragraph above we bear the risk of cost overruns and operating cost inflation in connection with projects covered by fixedprice contracts our failure to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a fixedprice project or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within the time frame committed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we do not continue to improve our operational financial and other internal controls and systems to manage our rapid growth our business may suffer and the value of our shareholders’ investment may be harmed 

our anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources our growth will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls both in the united states india and elsewhere in particular our continued growth will increase the challenges involved in 

 

  

  

  

  

 as part of our growth strategy we are expanding our operations in europe asia and latin america we may not be able to compete effectively in these markets and the cost of entering these markets may be substantially greater than we expect if we fail to compete effectively in the new markets we enter or if the cost of entering those markets is substantially greater than we expect our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we cannot compete effectively we may be required to reconsider our strategy to invest in our international expansion plans and change our intent on the repatriation of our earnings 

  

we rely on a few customers for a large portion of our revenues 

our top five customers generated approximately 194 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 and 239 of our revenues in the year ended december 31 2007 the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a major customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year the loss of one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we generally do not have longterm contracts with our customers and our results of operations could be adversely affected if our clients terminate their contracts with us on short notice 

consistent with industry practice we generally do not enter into longterm contracts with our customers a majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice as a result we are substantially exposed to volatility in the market for our services and may not be able to maintain our level of profitability 

when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to eliminate associated costs in a timely manner consequently our profit margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected if we are unable to market our services on terms we find acceptable our financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing rates 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to recover for our services if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our profit margin and our profitability could suffer the rates we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our operating results may experience significant quarterly fluctuations 

we historically have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations and expect these fluctuations to continue among the factors causing these variations have been 

 

  

  

  

 in addition our future revenues operating margins and profitability may fluctuate as a result of 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a high percentage of our operating expenses particularly personnel and rent are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter as a result unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects or in employee wage levels and utilization rates may cause significant variations in our operating results in any particular quarter and could result in losses any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations any material reduction in utilization rates for our professional staff or variance in the onsite offshore staffing mix an unanticipated termination of a major project a customer’s decision not to pursue a new project or proceed to succeeding stages of a current project or the completion during a quarter of several major customer projects could require us to pay underutilized employees and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as a result of these factors it is possible that in some future periods our revenues and operating results may be significantly below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such an event the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable utilization rates 

the cost of providing our services including the utilization rate of our professionals affects our profitability if we are not able to maintain an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals our profit margin and our profitability may suffer our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

 liability claims for damages caused by disclosure of confidential information or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business 

many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for the failure although we attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering 

  

our services we cannot assure you that any contractual limitations on liability will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages 

in addition we often have access to or are required to collect and store confidential client and customer data if any person including any of our employees penetrates our network security or misappropriates sensitive data we could be subject to significant liability to our clients or our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws as well as liability and penalties in connection with any violation of applicable privacy laws unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data whether through breach of our computer systems systems failure or otherwise could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 

although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be sufficient in amount to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be subject to legacy dun  bradstreet liabilities that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

in 1996 the dun  bradstreet corporation split itself into three separate companies the dun  bradstreet corporation cognizant corporation and acnielsen corporation in connection with the splitup transaction the dun  bradstreet corporation cognizant corporation renamed nielsen media research of which we were once a part and acnielsen corporation now a subsidiary of the nielsen company entered into a distribution agreement in the 1996 distribution agreement each party assumed the liabilities relating to the businesses allocated to it and agreed to indemnify the other parties and their subsidiaries against those liabilities and certain other matters the 1996 distribution agreement also prohibited each party thereto from distributing to its stockholders any business allocated to it unless the distributed business delivered undertakings agreeing to be jointly and severally liable to the other parties under the 1996 distribution agreement for the liabilities of the distributing parent company under the 1996 distribution agreement ims health made such undertaking when it was spun off by nielsen media research in 1998 and accordingly ims health and nielsen media research are jointly and severally liable to rh donnelly and acnielsen for cognizant corporation obligations under the terms of the 1996 distribution agreement ims health obtained similar undertakings from us as a condition to the distribution of our shares in the exchange offer pursuant to which ims health distributed all of our class b common stock that ims health owned to its stockholders on february 13 2003 ims health procured similar undertakings from us to nielsen media research and synavant inc with respect to liabilities allocated to ims health in connection with nielsen media research’s spinoff of ims health and ims health’s spinoff of synavant inc in connection with the exchange offer we gave these undertakings and as a result we may be subject to claims in the future in relation to legacy liabilities 

claims have arisen in the past and may arise in the future under the 1996 distribution agreement or the distribution agreements relating to nielsen media research’s spinoff of ims health and ims health’s spinoff of synavant inc in which case we may be jointly and severally liable for any losses suffered by the parties entitled to indemnification ims health has agreed to indemnify us for any and all liabilities that arise out of our undertakings to be jointly and severally liable for these liabilities but if for any reason ims health does not perform on their indemnification obligation these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our business may be adversely affected 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property we presently hold no patents or registered copyrights and rely upon a combination of copyright and trade secret laws nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and various security measures to protect our intellectual property rights existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions such as china might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights india is a member of the berne convention and has agreed to recognize protections on copyrights conferred under the laws of foreign countries including the laws of the united states we believe that laws rules regulations and treaties in effect in the united states india and other countries in which we operate are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our copyrights however there can be no assurance that these laws will not change and in particular that the laws of india or the united states will not change in ways that may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components libraries and toolsets from india to the united states or from the united states to india there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of any of our intellectual property or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in development of technology products or services that compete with our products and services and unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products services or proprietary information if we are unable to protect our intellectual property our business may be adversely affected 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we could have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients these claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions in a number of our contracts we have agreed to indemnify our clients for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area whether we ultimately win or lose could be timeconsuming and costly injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements we might not be able to enter into these royalty or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages we expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our competitors are able to obtain patents for software products and processes any infringement claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we could lose our ability or be unable to secure the right to utilize the intellectual property of others thirdparty suppliers of software hardware or other intellectual assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired our operating results could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to integrate acquired companies or technologies successfully and we may be subject to certain liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions that could harm our operating results 

we believe that opportunities exist in the fragmented it services market to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions and joint ventures we believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence especially in the european market enter new technology areas or expand our capacity we cannot assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices consummate any acquisition or joint venture or successfully integrate any acquired business or joint venture into our operations further acquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key personnel unanticipated events or 

  

circumstances and legal liabilities some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we may finance any future acquisitions with cash debt financing the issuance of equity securities or a combination of the foregoing we cannot assure you that we will be able to arrange adequate financing on acceptable terms in addition acquisitions financed with the issuance of our equity securities could be dilutive 

although we conduct due diligence in connection with each of our acquisitions there may be liabilities that we fail to discover or that we inadequately assess in our due diligence efforts in particular to the extent that any acquired businesses or properties failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations or failed to fulfill their contractual obligations to customers we as the successor owner may be financially responsible for these violations and failures and may suffer reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected while we generally require the selling party to indemnify us for any and all liabilities associated with such liabilities if for any reason the seller does not perform their indemnification obligation we may be held responsible for such liabilities in addition as part of an acquisition we may assume responsibilities and obligations of the acquired business pursuant to the terms and conditions of services agreements entered by the acquired entity that are not consistent with the terms and conditions that we typically accept and require although we attempt to structure acquisitions in such a manner as to minimize the liability that could arise from such contractual commitments we cannot assure you that any of our efforts to minimize the liability will be effective in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages under such agreements the discovery of any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions for which we are unable to receive indemnification for could harm our operating results 

system failure or disruptions in telecommunications could disrupt our business and result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

to deliver our services to our customers we must maintain a high speed network of satellite fiber optic and land lines and active voice and data communications 24 hours a day between our main offices in chennai our other it development centers and the offices of our customers worldwide although we maintain redundancy facilities and satellite communications links any systems failure or a significant lapse in our ability to transmit voice and data through satellite and telephone communications could result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

provisions in our charter bylaws and stockholders’ rights plan and provisions under delaware law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals 

provisions in our charter and bylaws each as amended our stockholders’ rights plan and delaware general corporate law or dgcl may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover proposals or delaying or preventing changes in our control or management including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices in addition these documents and provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests our board of directors has the authority without further action by the stockholders to fix the rights and preferences and issue shares of preferred stock our charter provides for a classified board of directors which will prevent a change of control of our board of directors at a single meeting of stockholders the prohibition of our stockholders’ ability to act by written consent and to call a special meeting will delay stockholder actions until annual meetings or until a special meeting is called by our chairman or chief executive officer or our board of directors the supermajorityvoting requirement for specified amendments to our charter and bylaws allows a minority of our stockholders to block those amendments the dgcl also contains provisions preventing stockholders from engaging in business combinations with us subject to certain exceptions these provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock 

  

compliance with new and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements adds uncertainty to our compliance policies and increases our costs of compliance 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to accounting corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 other sec regulations and the nasdaq global select market rules are creating uncertainty for companies like ours these laws regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such corporate governance standards 

in particular our efforts to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors’ audit of that assessment requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources we consistently assess the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting remediate any control deficiencies that may be identified and validate through testing that our controls are functioning as documented while we do not anticipate any material weaknesses the inability of management and our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy and effectiveness respectively of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure and our efforts to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities in addition the laws regulations and standards regarding corporate governance may make it more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with their performance of duties as a result we may face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which could harm our business if we fail to comply with new or changed laws regulations or standards of corporate governance our business and reputation may be harmed 

we are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio 

recent turmoil in the financial markets has adversely affected economic activity in the united states and other regions of the world in which we do business we believe that based on our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and expected operating cash flows the current lack of liquidity in the credit markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity cash flow or financial flexibility continued deterioration of the credit and capital markets could result in volatility of our investment earnings and impairments to our investment portfolio which could negatively impact our financial condition and reported income the continued decline in economic activity could adversely affect the ability of counterparties to certain financial instruments such as marketable securities and derivatives to meet their obligations to us 

funds associated with auctionrate securities that we hold as investments may not be liquid or accessible for in excess of 12 months and our auctionrate securities may decline in value 

as of december 31 2008 our shortterm and longterm investments totaled 1892 million and included 59 million in shortterm and 1335 million in longterm of aaarated auctionrate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans substantially backed by the federal family education loan program ffelp in addition the remainder of our longterm investments included an asset of 282 million related to the ubs right discussed below since february 14 2008 auctions failed for all the 

  

auctionrate securities still in our portfolio as of december 31 2008 we believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities and we continue to earn and receive interest on the auctionrate municipal debt securities at a predetermined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indexes all of the auctionrate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par in november 2008 we accepted an offer from ubs ag ubs to sell to ubs at par value 1685 million our auctionrate municipal debt securities at any time during an exercise period from june 30 2010 to july 2 2012 which we refer to as the ubs right in accepting the ubs right we granted ubs the authority to purchase these auctionrate municipal debt securities or sell them on our behalf at par any time after the execution of the ubs right through july 2 2012 the offer is nontransferable ubs’s inability to perform under the ubs right and the lack of liquidity for auctionrate municipal debt securities in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our stock price continues to be volatile 

our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price reflects future growth and profitability expectations if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive summary 

in 2008 our revenues increased to 28163 million compared to 21356 million in 2007 net income increased to 4308 million or 144 per diluted share including stockbased compensation expense and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense net of tax of 015 per diluted share during 2008 this is compared to 3501 million or 115 per diluted share including stockbased compensation expense and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense net of tax of 012 per diluted share during 2007 the key drivers of our revenue growth in 2008 were as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 we saw a continued increase in demand from our customers for a broad range of it solutions particularly high performance web development initiatives and complex systems development engagements testing enterprise resource planning or erp infrastructure management business process outsourcing and business intelligence we finished the year with approximately 565 active clients compared to approximately 500 as of december 31 2007 and increased the number of strategic clients by 21 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 128 we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate 5 million to 50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity our top five and top ten customers accounted for 194 and 300 respectively of our total revenues in 2008 as compared to 239 and 343 respectively for the year ended december 31 2007 as we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline over time 

in europe we continue to experience solid growth during 2008 our revenue from european customers increased by 578 to 5411 million compared to 3429 million in 2007 in 2008 revenue from europe excluding the uk increased by 913 million from 1218 million in 2007 to 2131 million europe will continue to be an area of significant investment for us in 2009 as we see this region and the asia pacific region particularly japan india australia and singapore as growth opportunities for the long term 

our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of and strong demand for offshore it software and services and business process outsourcing recent nasscom india’s national association of software and service companies reports state that india’s it software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to reach an estimated 47 billion by the end of the fiscal year march 31 2009 this is an expected growth rate of approximately 16 to 17 over the prior fiscal year 

in 2008 our operating margin increased to 183 compared to 179 in 2007 excluding stockbased compensation costs of 439 million and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 81 million operating margin in 2008 was 202 this was slightly above our historic targeted operating margin range excluding stockbased compensation costs and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 19 to 20 of total revenues the operating margin increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar and achieving operating efficiencies as a result of our revenue growth outpacing our headcount growth partially offset by an increase in compensation costs historically we have 

  

invested our profitability above the 19 to 20 operating margin level which excludes stockbased compensation and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense back into our business which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth this investment is primarily focused in the areas of i hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise ii training our technical staff in a broader range of it service offerings iii strengthening our business analytic capabilities iv strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services v continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery and vi recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees in addition this investment includes maintaining a level of resources trained in a broad range of service offerings to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects for 2009 we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our historical targeted operating margin levels back into the business 

during 2008 we experienced slower than initially expected revenue growth primarily due to the slowing global economy and softness in the financial services sector this along with the appreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar during the first half of 2008 and continuing wage inflation primarily in india put pressure on our operating margins in response we implemented actions during the year that mitigated these negative market trends including increasing the global utilization rates of our technical staff and reducing discretionary spending in the second half of 2008 we benefited from the depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar which favorably impacted our full yearoveryear operating margin by approximately 119 basis points or 119 percent each additional 10 change in the exchange rate between the indian rupee and the us dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 25 basis points or 025 percentage points 

we finished the year with total headcount of approximately 61700 an increase of approximately 6300 over the prior year the increases in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs to meet the demand for our services are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in 2008 annualized turnover including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 142 for 2008 the majority of our turnover occurs in india as a result annualized attrition rates onsite at clients are below our global attrition rate in addition attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff we have experienced wage inflation in india which may continue in the future however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as indian wages represented less than 20 of our total operating expenses 

our current india real estate development program now includes planned construction of approximately 45 million square feet of new space the expanded program which commenced during the quarter ended march 31 2007 includes the expenditure of approximately 3300 million through the end of the program on land acquisition facilities construction and furnishings to build new stateoftheart it development centers in regions primarily designated as special economic zones located in india during 2009 we expect to spend approximately 175 million globally for capital expenditures a portion of which relates to our india real estate development program 

at december 31 2008 we had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 7626 million and working capital of approximately 10805 million accordingly we do not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues during 2008 we repurchased 278 million of our class a common stock under a stock repurchase program that expired in september 2008 stock repurchases under this program were funded from working capital on december 3 2008 the board of directors authorized a 500 million stock repurchase program which expires in december 2009 and has similar terms to the previous program no shares were repurchased under this program in december 2008 

during 2009 we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results 

 

  

  

   

  

 in response to this challenging macroeconomic environment we plan to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 critical accounting estimates and risks 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixedbid contracts the allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes valuation of investments goodwill and other longlived assets assumptions used in valuing stockbased compensation arrangements contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts which are predominantly fixedpriced contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting under this method total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost cost to cost method this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations contract losses for all periods presented were immaterial 

  

stockbased compensation  under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised the expected volatility of our stock the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited and beginning in 2007 due to a recent tax law change in india the expected exercise proceeds for stockbased awards subject to the indian fringe benefit tax in addition for stock performance units we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period if actual results differ significantly from our estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance if any involves judgment as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate effective january 1 2007 we adopted financial interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of sfas no 109” fin 48 fin 48 contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement 

tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred income tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

our indian subsidiaries collectively cognizant india are exportoriented companies which under the indian income tax act of 1961 are entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each software technology park stp with respect to export profits for each stp substantially all of the earnings of cognizant india are attributable to export profits the majority of our stps in india are currently entitled to a 100 exemption from indian income tax under current law these tax holidays will be completely phased out by march 2010 in anticipation of the complete phase out of these tax holidays in march 2010 we expect to continue to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as special economic zones sezs development centers operating in sezs will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years under current indian tax law export profits after march 31 2010 from our existing stps will be fully taxable at the indian statutory rate 3399 as of december 31 2008 in effect at such time if the tax holidays relating to our indian stps are not extended or new tax incentives are not introduced that would effectively 

  

extend the income tax holiday benefits beyond march 2010 we expect that our effective income tax rate would increase significantly beginning in calendar year 2010 

investments  historically our investments have been in municipal debt securities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction process corporate notes and bonds us government agencies bank time deposits and commercial paper meeting certain criteria we evaluate our availableforsale investments periodically for possible otherthantemporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis the financial condition of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value of our availableforsale securities exceeds the fair market value of the securities and the decline in value is determined to be otherthantemporary 

determining the fair value of our investment in auctionrate securities with unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity requires judgment including determining the appropriate holding period and discount rate to be used in valuing such securities we value our investment in auctionrate securities using a discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates the following key inputs i the underlying structure of each security ii frequency and amounts of cash flows iii expected holding period for the security and iv discount rates that are believed to reflect current market conditions and the relevant risk associated with each security in estimating the holding period we considered the current developments in the auctionrate market including our ability to hold the securities for such period of time recent calls of auctionrate securities by issuers and the possible reestablishment of an active market for the auctionrate securities that we hold based upon these factors we used a holding period of five years for securities with a stated maturity beyond five years which represents the period of time we anticipate will elapse before a liquidity event will occur an increase or decrease in the holding period by two years would change the fair value of our investment in auctionrate securities by approximately 100 million we derive the discount rate by considering observable interest rate yields for bonds supported by student loans and pricing of new bond issuances and adding an illiquidity premium to such rates the illiquidity premium was estimated by management considering current market conditions as of december 31 2008 we used a weightedaverage illiquidity premium of 140 basis points this weightedaverage illiquidity premium has been impacted by overall issues within the credit and capital markets and related increases in volatility including uncertainty of the credit and money markets an increase or decrease to the illiquidity premium of 100 basis points would change the estimated fair value of our investment in auctionrate securities by approximately 60 million our valuation is also impacted by changes in market interest rates because the interest payments we receive on our auctionrate securities vary based on a predetermined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices an increase or decrease in market interest rates of 50 basis points would change the estimated fair value of our investment in auctionrate securities by approximately 90 million we anticipate there will be ongoing developments in the credit markets and the market for the auctionrate securities that we hold accordingly our estimates of the expected holding period and illiquidity premium used in valuing such securities are reasonably likely to change in the shortterm 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative creditworthiness of each customer historical collections experience and other information including the aging of the receivables if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant when determining the fair value of our reporting units we utilize various assumptions including projections of future cash flows any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge as of december 31 2008 our goodwill balance was 1540 million 

longlived assets  in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we review longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever 

  

events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in general we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset if such assets were determined to be impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks the majority of our it development centers including a majority of our employees are located in india as a result we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights limitations on immigration programs the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potential geopolitical and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts and potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers we are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the inability of our management and our independent auditor to provide us with reasonable assurance regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline see part i item 1a “risk factors”

the following table includes nongaap income from operations excluding stockbased compensation and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense a measure defined by the securities and exchange commission as a nongaap financial measure this nongaap financial measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies in addition this nongaap measure the financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and reconciliations of our gaap financial statements to such nongaap measure should be carefully evaluated 

we seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin excluding stockbased compensation costs and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 19 to 20 of revenues accordingly we believe that nongaap income from operations excluding stockbased compensation costs and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes we use financial statements that do not include stockbased compensation expense and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors moreover because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under sfas no 123r we believe that providing a nongaap financial measure that excludes stockbased compensation expense and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies accordingly we believe that the presentation of nongaap income from operations when read in conjunction with our reported gaap income from operations can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 

a limitation of using nongaap income from operations versus income from operations reported in accordance with gaap is that nongaap income from operations excludes costs namely stockbased compensation and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense that are recurring stockbased compensation and the related indian fringe benefit tax expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business in addition other companies may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than us thereby limiting the usefulness of this nongaap financial measure as a comparative tool we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from nongaap income from operations and evaluating such nongaap financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap 

a reconciliation of income from operations as reported and nongaap income from operations excluding stockbased compensation expense and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense is as follows for the years ended december 31

our reportable segments are financial services which includes customers providing banking  transaction processing capital markets and insurance services healthcare which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers manufacturingretaillogistics which includes manufacturers retailers travel and other hospitality customers as well as customers providing logistics services and other which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which individually are less than 100 of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit the other segment includes media and information services communications and high technology operating segments our sales managers account executives account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve 

  

our chief operating decision maker evaluates cognizant’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers certain expenses such as general and administrative and a portion of depreciation and amortization are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment further stockbased compensation expense and the related stockbased india fringe benefit tax are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as “unallocated” and are adjusted only against the total income from operations 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 565 active customers accordingly we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments therefore a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment however no individual customer exceeded 100 of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in addition the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues

our financing activities provided net cash of approximately 440 million for the year ended december 31 2008 40 million for the year ended december 31 2007 and 829 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase in 2008 relates primarily to lower class a common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and lower proceeds and excess tax benefits from exercises of employee stock options the decrease in 2007 relates primarily to class a common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program offset in part by higher proceeds and excess tax benefits from exercises of employee stock options 

as of december 31 2008 our shortterm and longterm investments totaled 1892 million and included 59 million in shortterm and 1335 million in longterm of aaarated auctionrate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans substantially backed by the ffelp in addition the remainder of our longterm investments included 282 million of an auctionrate securities related ubs right discussed below since february 14 2008 auctions failed for all the auctionrate securities still in our portfolio as of december 31 2008 we believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities and we continue to earn and receive interest on the auctionrate municipal debt securities at a predetermined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices all of the auctionrate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par 

in november 2008 we accepted an offer from ubs to sell to ubs at par value 1685 million our auctionrate securities at any time during an exercise period from june 30 2010 to july 2 2012 which we refer to as the ubs right in accepting the ubs right we granted ubs the authority to purchase these auctionrate securities or sell them on our behalf at par any time after the execution of the ubs right through july 2 2012 the offer is nontransferable we elected to measure the ubs right under the fair value option of sfas no 159 and recorded pretax income of 282 million and a corresponding long term investment at the same time we transferred our investment in auctionrate securities from availableforsale securities to trading securities as a result of this transfer we recognized a pretax loss of 291 million reflecting the reversal to income of the unrealized loss previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income these transactions were recorded in the caption “other income expense net” in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 

based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months if a liquidity event does not occur prior to the exercise period under the ubs right we expect to obtain liquidity through the ubs right if ubs is unable to honor its obligations under the ubs right we believe we will be able to ultimately recover our investment in auctionrate municipal debt securities due to i the strength of the underlying collateral substantially backed by ffelp and ii the aaa credit rating of the securities held by us however it could take until the final maturity of the underlying security up to 33 years to realize our investments’ recorded value 

  

our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our longterm capital requirements beyond a 12month period will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from india and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we cannot be certain that additional financing if required will be available on terms favorable to us if at all we expect our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months 

commitments and contingencies 

our current india real estate development program now includes planned construction of approximately 45 million square feet of new space the expanded program which commenced during the quarter ended march 31 2007 includes the expenditure of approximately 3300 million on land acquisition facilities construction and furnishings to build new stateoftheart it development centers in regions primarily designated as sezs located in india as of december 31 2008 we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately 553 million related to our india development center expansion program 

during december 2008 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchased 500 million of our class a common stock this authorization expires in december 2009 and we have not purchased any shares in 2008 under this program any future repurchases under this program will be funded from a combination of cash on hand and cash flows from operations 

as of december 31 2008 we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

  

  in connection with a 2008 acquisition additional purchase price not to exceed 140 million payable in 2010 is contingent on the acquired company achieving certain financial and operating targets during an earnout period we will fund such payment if any from operating cash flow contingent purchase price payments relating to acquisitions are recorded when the contingencies are resolved the ultimate amount payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because the amount is dependent on future results of operations of the acquired business in accordance with us gaap we have not recorded a liability for this item on our balance sheet because the definitive amount is not determinable or distributable the contingent consideration if paid will be recorded as an additional element of the cost of the acquired company 

as of december 31 2008 we had 64 million of unrecognized tax benefits this represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution the resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 

  

we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management the outcome of such claims and legal actions if decided adversely is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results cash flows or consolidated financial position additionally many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our application design development and maintenance services there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results financial position and cash flows 

foreign currency risk 

overall we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign exchange rates as approximately 791 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 are generated from customers located in north america however a portion of our costs in india representing approximately 296 of our global operating costs for the year ended december 31 2008 are denominated in the indian rupee and are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations these foreign exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations in addition a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which may result in nonoperating foreign currency gains or losses upon remeasurement in 2008 we reported foreign currency losses of approximately 228 million which are primarily attributed to the remeasurement of i us dollar denominated intercompany payables from our european subsidiaries to cognizant india for services performed by cognizant india on behalf of our european customers and ii indian rupee net monetary assets on cognizant india’s books to the us dollar functional currency on an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the indian rupee in our indian subsidiaries 

during december 2008 we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses including salaries these us dollar  indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs as of december 31 2008 the notional value of these contracts is 820 million and are scheduled to mature during the first quarter of 2009 in january 2009 we entered into additional foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional value of 2680 million these contracts are scheduled to mature over the remainder of 2009 

there were no other offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2008 2007 and 2006 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources 

effects of inflation 

our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals competition in india the united states and europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform the services we offer has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation as with other it service providers we must adequately anticipate wage increases particularly on our fixedprice contracts there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the united states and elsewhere we have experienced wage 

  

inflation in india however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as indian wages represented less than 200 of our total operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2008 

recent accounting pronouncements 

effective january 1 2008 we adopted sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a marketbased framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 is applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value sfas no 157 does not expand or require any new fair value measures however the application of this statement may change current practice sfas no 157 does not apply to fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” in february 2008 the financial accounting standards board fasb decided that an entity need not apply this standard to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis until 2009 accordingly our adoption of this standard in 2008 was limited to financial assets and liabilities which primarily affects the valuation of our investments and derivative contracts the adoption of sfas no 157 did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations we do not believe the full adoption of sfas no 157 with respect to our nonfinancial assets and liabilities will have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations nonfinancial assets and liabilities for which we have not applied the provisions of sfas no 157 primarily include those measured at fair value in impairment testing and those initially measured at fair value in a business combination 

in october 2008 the fasb issued fsp fas 1573 “determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active” “fsp fas 1573” which addresses the application of sfas no 157 for illiquid financial instruments the adoption of fsp fas 1573 did not change our valuation methodology or have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” “sfas no 159” which is effective for financial statements beginning january 1 2008 sfas no 159 permits entities to measure eligible financial assets financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value on an instrumentbyinstrument basis that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other generally accepted accounting principles the fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings effective january 1 2008 we adopted sfas no 159 and have elected the fair value option for our ubs right as detailed in note 9 of our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas no 141r” sfas no 141r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction whether a full or partial acquisition establishes the acquisitiondate fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires expensing of transaction and restructuring costs and requires the acquirer to disclose the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination sfas no 141r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january 1 2009 the impact of sfas no 141r on our consolidated financial statements will depend upon the nature terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 51” “sfas no 160” sfas no 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated sfas no 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and 

  

distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 as of december 31 2008 we did not have any noncontrolling interests in other entities accordingly we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 160 will have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 133” “sfas no 161” sfas no 161 applies to all derivative instruments and related hedged items accounted for under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” “sfas no 133” sfas no 161 requires entities to provide greater transparency about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 133 and its related interpretations and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position results of operations and cash flows sfas no 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 we will adopt sfas no 161 in 2009

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations and may use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures 

during december 2008 we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in india cognizant india converts us dollar receipts from intercompany billings to indian rupees to fund local expenses including salaries these us dollar  indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs as of december 31 2008 the notional value of these contracts is 820 million and are scheduled to mature during the first quarter of 2009 at december 31 2008 the net unrealized gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was 06 million based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at december 31 2008 which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations 

  

a 100 change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately 80 million in january 2009 we entered into additional foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional value of 2680 million these contracts are scheduled to mature over the remainder of 2009 

there were no other offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2008 2007 and 2006 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources 

we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 9243 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments most of which are impacted almost immediately by changes in shortterm interest rates we limit our credit risk by investing primarily in aaaaaa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s and fitch rating services and restricting amounts that can be invested with any single issuer 

as of december 31 2008 our shortterm and longterm investments totaled 1892 million and included 59 million in shortterm and 1335 million in longterm of aaarated auctionrate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans substantially backed by the ffelp in addition the remainder of our longterm investments included 282 million of an auctionrate related ubs right discussed below since february 14 2008 auctions failed for all the auctionrate securities still in our portfolio as of december 31 2008 we believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities and we continue to earn and receive interest on the auctionrate municipal debt securities at a predetermined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices all of the auctionrate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par 

in november 2008 we accepted an offer from ubs to sell to ubs at par value 1685 million our auctionrate securities at any time during an exercise period from june 30 2010 to july 2 2012 which we refer to as the ubs right in accepting the ubs right we granted ubs the authority to purchase these auctionrate securities or sell them on our behalf at par any time after the execution of the ubs right through july 2 2012 the offer is nontransferable we elected to measure the ubs right under the fair value option of sfas no 159 and recorded pretax income of 282 million and a corresponding long term investment at the same time we transferred our investment in auctionrate securities from availableforsale securities to trading securities as a result of this transfer we recognized a pretax loss on our consolidated statement of operations of 291 million reflecting the reversal of the unrealized loss previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income

 item 1 business tableend overview 

we are a leading provider of custom information technology it consulting and technology services as well as outsourcing services for global 2000 companies located in north america europe and asia our core competencies include technology strategy consulting complex systems development enterprise software package implementation and maintenance data warehousing and business intelligence application testing application maintenance infrastructure management and verticallyoriented business process outsourcing vbpo we tailor our services to specific industries and utilize an integrated onsiteoffshore business model this seamless onsiteoffshore business model combines technical and account management teams located onsite at the customer location and offshore at dedicated development centers located primarily in india 

industry background 

many companies today face intense competitive pressure and rapidly changing market dynamics driven by such factors as changes in government regulations globalization and technology innovation in response to these challenges many companies are focused on improving productivity increasing service levels lowering costs and accelerating delivery times in order to achieve these goals companies are focusing on a number of technologycentric areas such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these approaches and technologies facilitate faster more responsive lowercost business operations however their development integration and ongoing maintenance present major challenges and require a large number of highly skilled professionals trained in many diverse technologies in addition companies also require additional technical resources to maintain enhance and reengineer their core legacy it systems and to address application maintenance projects increasingly companies are relying on custom it solutions providers such as us to provide these services 

in order to respond effectively to a changing and challenging business environment it departments of many companies have focused increasingly on improving returns on it investments lowering costs and accelerating the delivery of new systems and solutions to accomplish these objectives many it departments have shifted all or a portion of their it development integration and maintenance requirements to outside service providers operating with onsiteoffshore business models 

global demand for high quality lower cost it services from outside providers has created a significant opportunity for it service providers that can successfully leverage the benefits of and address the challenges in using an offshore talent pool the effective use of offshore personnel can offer a variety of benefits including lower costs faster delivery of new it solutions and innovations in vertical solutions processes and technologies certain developing countries particularly india and china have large talent pools of highly qualified technical professionals that can provide high quality it and business processing outsourcing bpo services at a lower cost india is a leader in it services and is regarded as having one of the largest and highest quality pools of talent in the world historically it service providers have used offshore labor pools primarily to supplement the internal staffing needs of customers however evolving customer demands have led to the increasing acceptance and use of offshore resources for higher valueadded services these services include application design development testing integration and maintenance as well as technology consulting and infrastructure management india’s services and software exports continue to see significant growth according to nasscom india’s national association of software and services companies itbpo exports from india were an estimated 313 billion for the fiscal year ended march 31 2007 with it software and services exports growing 36 and bpo exports growing 34 in fiscal 2007 the it  bpo sector is projected to grow to greater than 60 billion by 2010 

  

using a globally distributed workforce to provide valueadded services presents a number of challenges to it service providers the offshore implementation of valueadded it services requires that it service providers continually and effectively attract train and retain highly skilled software development professionals with the advanced technical skills necessary to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences these skills are necessary to design develop and deploy highquality technology solutions in a costeffective and timely manner in addition it service providers must have the methodologies processes and communications capabilities to enable offshore workforces to be successfully integrated with onsite personnel service providers must also have strong research and development capabilities technology competency centers and relationship management skills in order to compete effectively 

the cognizant approach 

our business is organized and managed primarily around our four verticallyoriented business segments

 international time differences enable our offshore teams located in india to access a customer’s computing facilities located in north america europe and the asia pacific region during offpeak hours this ability to perform services during offpeak hours enables us to complete projects more rapidly and does not require our customers to invest in duplicative hardware and software in addition for large projects with short time frames our offshore facilities allow for parallel processing of various development phases to accelerate delivery time in addition we can deliver services more rapidly than some competitors without an offshore labor pool because our lower labor costs enable us to costeffectively assign more professionals to a project

further develop longterm customer relationships we have strong longterm strategic relationships with our customers and business partners we seek to establish longterm relationships that present recurring revenue opportunities frequently trying to establish relationships with our customers’ chief information officers or other it decision makers by offering a wide array of costeffective high quality services approximately 96 of our revenues in the year ended december 31 2007 were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2006 we also seek to leverage our experience with a customer’s it systems into new business opportunities knowledge of a customer’s processes and it systems gained during the performance of application maintenance services for example may provide us with a competitive advantage in securing additional development and maintenance projects from that customer 

expand service offerings and solutions we have several teams dedicated to developing new high value services these teams collaborate with customers to develop these services for example we are currently developing new offerings in business consulting and it consulting and verticallyoriented it solutions atop innovative technologies including service oriented architectures soa and web 20 in addition we invest in internal research and development and promote knowledge building and sharing across the organization in order to promote the development of new services and solutions that we can offer to our customers furthermore we continue to enhance our capabilities and service offerings in the areas of 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that the continued expansion of our service offerings will reduce our reliance on any one technology initiative and will help foster longterm relationships with our customers by allowing us to serve their needs better 

enhance processes methodologies and productivity toolsets we are committed to improving and enhancing our proprietary qview software engineering process and other methodologies and toolsets in light of the rapid evolution of technology we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our continued success we are constantly designing and developing additional productivity software tools to automate testing processes and improve project estimation and risk assessment techniques in addition we use groupware technology to share project experience and best practice methodologies across the organization with the objective of improving productivity 

expand domestic and international geographic presence  as we expand our customer base we plan to open additional sales and marketing offices in north america europe south america and asia it is expected that this expansion will facilitate sales and service to existing and new customers we have established sales and marketing offices in atlanta boston bridgewater nj chicago dallas minneapolis phoenix los angeles norwalk ct san francisco and teaneck in addition we have been pursuing market opportunities internationally through our offices in amsterdam buenos aires cyberjaya malaysia frankfurt london melbourne paris shanghai singapore tokyo toronto and zurich

many of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our services include 

 

  

  

  

  

 we rely on the following to compete effectively

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highly skilled it development professionals in particular we need to attract train and retain project managers programmers and other senior technical personnel we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for it development professionals in the 

  

united states and in india with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer we have an active recruitment program in india and have developed a recruiting system and database that facilitates the rapid identification of skilled candidates during the course of the year we conduct extensive recruiting efforts at premier colleges and technical schools in india we evaluate candidates based on academic performance the results of a written aptitude test measuring problemsolving skills and a technical interview in addition we have an active lateral recruiting program in north america europe and india a substantial majority of the personnel on most onsite teams and virtually all the personnel staffed on offshore teams is comprised of indian nationals 

our senior project managers are hired from leading consulting firms in the united states and india our senior management and most of our project managers have experience working in the united states and europe this enhances our ability to attract and retain other professionals with experience in the united states we have also adopted a career and education management program to define our employees’ objectives and career plans we have implemented an intensive orientation and training program to introduce new employees to the qview software engineering process our other technologies and our services 

our executive officers

corporate history 

we began our it development and maintenance services business in early 1994 as an inhouse technology development center for the dun  bradstreet corporation and its operating units in 1996 we along with certain other entities were spunoff from the dun  bradstreet corporation to form a new company cognizant corporation on june 24 1998 we completed an initial public offering of our class a common stock on june 30 1998 a majority interest in us and certain other entities were spunoff from cognizant corporation to form ims health subsequently cognizant corporation was renamed nielsen media research incorporated 

on january 30 2003 we filed a tender offer in which ims health stockholders could exchange ims health shares held by them for our class b common stock held by ims health 

on february 13 2003 ims health distributed all of our class b common stock that ims health owned in an exchange offer to its stockholders there was no impact on the number of our total shares outstanding upon the completion of the exchange offer 

as of february 21 2003 pursuant to our restated certificate of incorporation all of the shares of class b common stock automatically converted into shares of class a common stock according to our restated certificate of incorporation if at any time the outstanding shares of our class b common stock ceased to represent at least 35 of the economic ownership represented by the aggregate number of shares of our common stock then outstanding each share of our class b common stock shall automatically convert into one share of class a common stock this automatic conversion occurred on february 21 2003 based on share numbers received by us from our transfer agent american stock transfer and trust company as of the close of business february 20 2003 which indicated that the class b common stock represented less than 35 ownership represented by the aggregate number of shares of our common stock then outstanding accordingly as of february 21 2003 there are no shares of class b common stock outstanding

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the risks and uncertainties detailed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india and we are subject to regulatory economic and political uncertainties in india 

we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india where as of december 31 2007 a majority of our technical professionals were located while wage costs are lower in india than in the united states and other developed countries for comparably skilled professionals wages in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states which could result in our incurring increased costs for technical professionals and reduced operating margins in addition there is intense competition in india for skilled technical professionals and we expect that competition to increase 

india has also experienced civil unrest and terrorism and has been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries in recent years there have been military confrontations between india and pakistan that have occurred in the region of kashmir and along the indiapakistan border the potential for hostilities between the two countries has been high in light of tensions related to recent terrorist incidents in india and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment including events in and related to afghanistan and iraq if india were to become engaged in armed hostilities particularly if these hostilities were protracted or involved the threat of or use of weapons of mass destruction our operations would be materially adversely affected in addition us companies may decline to contract with us for services in light of international terrorist incidents or armed hostilities even where india is not involved because of more generalized concerns about relying on a service provider utilizing international resources 

in the past the indian economy has experienced many of the problems confronting the economies of developing countries including high inflation erratic gross domestic product growth and shortages of foreign exchange the indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy and indian government actions concerning the economy could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities including us in the past the indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy including the software development services industry programs that have benefited us include among others tax holidays liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation notwithstanding these benefits india’s central and state governments remain significantly involved in the indian economy as regulators in recent years the indian government has 

  

introduced nonincome related taxes including the fringe benefit tax and new service taxes the elimination of any of the benefits realized by us from our indian operations or the imposition of new taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are investing substantial cash assets in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately 

as of december 31 2007 we had contractual commitments of approximately 1267 million related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our it development centers we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability will be reduced 

our international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties 

revenues from customers outside north america represented approximately 17 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 14 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 and 13 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 we anticipate that revenues from customers outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence particularly in europe in addition a majority of our employees and almost all of our it development centers are located in india as a result we may be subject to risks associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions from time to time we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate our risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in addition we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations we may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture our international expansion plans may not be successful and we may not be able to compete effectively in other countries there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the indian rupee and other foreign currency exchange rates 

although we report our operating results in us dollars a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues income from operations and the value of balancesheet items originally denominated in other currencies during the year ended december 31 2007 the appreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar negatively impacted our operating margins by 210 basis points or 21 percentage points as compared to 2006 there is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations including further appreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar or that any efforts by us to engage in currency hedging activities would be effective in addition in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which could limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations finally as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee against the us dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency 

we face intense competition from other it service providers 

the intensely competitive it professional services market includes a large number of participants and is subject to rapid change this market includes participants from a variety of market segments including 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 the market also includes numerous smaller local competitors in the various geographic markets in which we operate our direct competitors who use the onsiteoffshore business model include among others infosys technologies tata consultancy services and wipro in addition many of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do some of these larger competitors such as accenture electronic data systems and ibm global services have offshore operations we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our current levels of profitability or growth as competitive pressures including competition for skilled it development professionals and pricing pressure from competitors employing an onsiteoffshore business model increase 

we may not be able to sustain our current level of profitability 

for the year ended december 31 2007 and the year ended december 31 2006 we had an operating margin of 179 and 182 respectively compared to an operating margin of 201 for the year ended december 31 2005 our operating margin has declined as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” which required us to record stock compensation expense for equitybased compensation awards primarily stock option grants by us in our consolidated statement of operations effective january 1 2006 in addition effective april 1 2007 the government in india has imposed a fringe benefit tax on the company for the income generated upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of performance stock units for employees who worked in india during the vesting period for such award although we recover the fringe benefit tax from the employee’s proceeds upon sale or vesting of the stockbased compensation award we are required under us gaap to record the fringe benefit tax as an operating expense reducing our profitability while the recovery of the fringe benefit tax by us from the employee is reported as an addition to additional paidin capital our operating margin may decline further if we experience declines in demand and pricing for our services imposition of new nonincome related taxes or due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition wages in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states which could result in us incurring increased costs for technical professionals additionally the number and type of equitybased compensation awards and the assumptions used in valuing equitybased compensation awards may change resulting in increased stock compensation expense and lower margins although we have been able to partially offset wage increases and foreign currency fluctuations through further leveraging of our lowcost operating structure obtaining price increases and issuing a lower number of stock options and other equitybased compensation awards in proportion to our overall headcount we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 

our business will suffer if we fail to develop new services and enhance our existing services in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological environment 

the it services market is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions our future success will depend on our ability to develop solutions that keep pace with changes in the it services market we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing new services addressing evolving technologies on a timely or costeffective basis or if these services are developed that we will be successful in the marketplace in addition we cannot assure you that products services or technologies developed by others will not render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to remain competitive will also depend on our ability to design and implement in a timely and costeffective manner solutions for customers that both leverage their legacy systems and appropriately utilize newer technologies such as web 20 models softwareasaservice and service oriented architectures our failure to design and implement solutions in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may face difficulties in providing endtoend business solutions for our clients that could cause clients to discontinue their work with us which in turn could harm our business 

we have been expanding the nature and scope of our engagements and have added new service offerings such as it consulting business process outsourcing systems integration and outsourcing of entire portions of it infrastructure the success of these service offerings is dependent in part upon continued demand for such services by our existing and new clients and our ability to meet this demand in a costcompetitive and effective manner in addition our ability to effectively offer a wider breadth of endtoend business solutions depends on our ability to attract existing or new clients to these service offerings to obtain engagements for such endtoend solutions we also are more likely to compete with large wellestablished international consulting firms resulting in increased competition and marketing costs accordingly we cannot be certain that our new service offerings will effectively meet client needs or that we will be able to attract existing and new clients to these service offerings 

  

the increased breadth of our service offerings may result in larger and more complex projects with our clients this will require us to establish closer relationships with our clients and a thorough understanding of their operations our ability to establish such relationships will depend on a number of factors including the proficiency of our it professionals and our management personnel our failure to understand our client requirements or our failure to deliver services which meet the requirements specified by our clients could result in termination of client contracts and we could be liable to our clients for significant penalties or damages 

larger projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements these terminations cancellations or delays may result from the business or financial condition of our clients or the economy generally as opposed to factors related to the quality of our services such cancellations or delays make it difficult to plan for project resource requirements and inaccuracies in such resource planning may have a negative impact on our profitability 

our results of operations may be affected by the rate of growth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of technology spending by our clients 

our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients and their customers and suppliers in challenging economic environments our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities at the same time many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel processes and infrastructures if the growth of use of technology in business or our clients’ spending on technology in business declines or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new technology solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected 

competition for highly skilled technical personnel is intense and the success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled professionals 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highly skilled it development professionals in particular we need to attract train and retain project managers it engineers and other senior technical personnel we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for it development professionals in the united states and india with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer we have subcontracted to a limited extent in the past and may do so in the future with other service providers in order to meet our obligations to our customers our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend in large part on our ability to attract train and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences further we must train and manage our growing work force requiring an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel we cannot assure you that the management skills and systems currently in place will be adequate or that we will be able to train and assimilate new employees successfully our failure to attract train and retain current or future employees could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our growth may be hindered by immigration restrictions 

our future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills from developing countries especially india the vast majority of our it professionals in the united states and in europe are indian nationals the ability of indian nationals to work in the united states depends on their ability and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits 

the h1b visa classification enables us employers to hire qualified foreign workers in positions that require an education at least equal to a baccalaureate degree in the united states in specialty occupations such as it systems engineering and systems analysis the h1b visa usually permits an individual to work and live in the united states for a period of up to six years under certain circumstances h1b visa extensions after the sixyear period may be available there is a limit on the number of new h1b petitions that united states citizenship and immigration services or cis one of the successor agencies to the immigration and naturalization service may approve in any federal fiscal year and in years in which this limit is reached we may be unable to obtain h1b visas necessary to bring foreign employees to the united states in the current federal fiscal year the limit is 65000 the fiscal year 2008 cap was reached on april 2 2007 the fiscal year 2008 cap of 20000 for graduates of us advanced degree programs was reached on april 30 2007 the fiscal year 2007 cap was reached on may 26 2006 the fiscal year 2007 cap of 20000 for graduates of us advanced degree programs was reached on july 26 2006 we will be able to file h1b applications against the fiscal year 2009 cap beginning on april 1 

  

2008 for work in h1b status beginning on october 1 2008 each year the h1b cap is reached at an earlier point prior to the beginning of the fiscal year for which the h1b’s will be available however as a part of our advanced planning process we believe that we have sufficient employees visaready to meet our anticipated business growth in the current year in addition there are strict labor regulations associated with the h1b visa classification larger users of the h1b visa program are often subject to investigations by the wage and hour division of the united states department of labor a finding by the united states department of labor of willful or substantial failure by us to comply with existing regulations on the h1b classification may result in backpay liability substantial fines andor a ban on future use of the h1b program and other immigration benefits we are currently subject to such an investigation as described in the immediately following risk factor 

we also regularly transfer employees from india to the united states to work on projects and at client sites using the l1 visa classification the l1 visa allows companies abroad to transfer certain managers executives and employees with specialized company knowledge to related us companies such as a parent subsidiary affiliate joint venture or branch office we have an approved “blanket l program” under which the corporate relationships of our transferring and receiving entities have been preapproved by the cis thus enabling individual l1 visa applications to be presented directly to a visaissuing us consular post abroad rather than undergoing the preapproval process in the united states in recent years both the us consular posts that review initial l1 applications and the cis offices which adjudicate extensions of l1 status have become more restrictive with respect to this category as a result the rate of refusals of initial l1 applications and of extensions has increased in addition even where l1 visas are ultimately granted and issued security measures undertaken by us consular posts around the world have delayed visa issuances our inability to bring qualified technical personnel into the united states to staff onsite customer locations would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

on december 8 2004 president bush signed the l1 visa reform act which was part of the fiscal year 2005 omnibus appropriations act public law 108447 at division j title iv this legislation contained several important changes to the laws governing l1 visa holders all of the changes took effect on june 8 2005 under one provision of the new law all l1 applicants including those brought to the united states under a blanket l program must have worked abroad with the related company for one full year in the prior three years the provision allowing blanket l applicants who had worked abroad for the related company for six months during the qualifying threeyear period was revoked in addition l1b holders intracompany transferees with specialized company knowledge may not be primarily stationed at the work site of another employer if the l1b holder will be controlled and supervised by an employer other than the petitioning employer finally l1b status may not be granted where placement of the l1b visa holder at a third party site is part of an arrangement to provide labor for the third party rather than placement at the site in connection with the provision of a product or service involving specialized knowledge specific to the petitioning employer 

we do not place l1b workers at third party sites where they are under the primary supervision of a different employer nor do we place l1b holders at third party sites in an arrangement to provide labor for the third party without providing a service involving our specialized knowledge since implementation of the new law we consistently establish this fact to cis’s satisfaction however if cis andor the united states department of state through its visaissuing us consular posts abroad decide to interpret these provisions in a very restrictive fashion this could impair our ability to staff our projects in the united states with resources from our entities abroad in addition cis has not yet issued regulations governing these new provisions if such regulations are restrictive in nature this could impair our ability to staff our projects in the united states with resources from our entities abroad 

we also process immigrant visas for lawful permanent residence for employees to fill positions for which there are no able willing and qualified us workers available to fill the positions compliance with existing us immigration and labor laws or changes in those laws making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting our ability to successfully obtain permanent residence for our foreign employees in the united states could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the united states any of these restrictions or limitations on our hiring practices could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to immigration restrictions in the united states there are certain restrictions on transferring our employees to work in the united kingdom where we have experienced significant growth the united kingdom requires that employees who are not nationals of the european economic area eea which includes nationals of all european union countries except bulgaria and romania plus iceland norway liechtenstein and switzerland obtain an intracompany transfer work permit before beginning to perform work under the work permit regulations in order for us to transfer our noneea employees to the united kingdom we must demonstrate that the employee had been employed by us for at least six months prior to the transfer and that the position in the united kingdom requires someone with either 1 a united kingdom degree level qualification or 2 a higher national diploma hnd level occupational qualification which is relevant to the uk position or 3 a general hnd level qualification plus one year’s work experience doing the type of job 

  

for which the work permit is sought or 4 at least three years’ highlevel specialist skills acquired through doing the type of job for which the work permit is sought these restrictions restrain our ability to add the skilled professionals we need for our operations in europe and could have an adverse affect on our international strategy to expand our presence in europe as a result the work permit legislation in the united kingdom could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the united states the united kingdom and other countries are subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement immigration and work permit laws and regulation can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity our international expansion strategy and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with it professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed 

our results of operations and business may be affected by an investigation currently being conducted by the wage and hour division of the united states department of labor 

there are strict labor regulations associated with the h1b visa classification larger users of the h1b visa program are often subject to investigations by the wage and hour division of the united states department of labor the department of labor has commenced an investigation to determine if we have complied with the elements of the labor condition applications eta form 9035 used by us to hire certain h1b nonimmigrant workers we believe the department of labor is primarily focused on whether our employees with h1b renewals were paid at the appropriate pay level the investigation has recently been commenced and is in its early stages we do not currently have a timetable in which this investigation will be concluded while we believe we have complied with the applicable regulations an adverse finding by the united states department of labor may result in backpay liability substantial fines andor a ban on future use of the h1b program and other immigration benefits which could potentially have a harmful effect on our business and results of operations 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business 

because we provide services to clients throughout the world we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal rules on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations violations of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our customers 

the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest market for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by us companies are under discussion in congress and in numerous state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs in the united states while no substantive antioutsourcing legislation has been introduced to date given the ongoing debate over this issue the introduction of such legislation is possible if introduced such measures are likely to fall within two categories 1 a broadening of restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly andor 2 measures that impact private industry such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions in the event that any of these measures become law our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and our ability to service our customers could be impaired 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data particularly involving service providers in india current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to offshore providers to avoid negative perceptions that may be associated with using an offshore provider any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward offshore outsourcing would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide services from within the country in which our clients operate 

  

legislation enacted in certain european jurisdictions and any future legislation in europe japan or any other country in which we have clients restricting the performance of business process services from an offshore location could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example new legislation recently enacted in the united kingdom based on the 1977 ec acquired rights directive that has been adopted in some form by many european union or eu countries provides that if a company outsources all or part of its business to a service provider or changes its current service provider the affected employees of the company or of the previous service provider are entitled to become employees of the new service provider generally on the same terms and conditions as their original employment in addition dismissals of employees who were employed by the company or the previous service provider immediately prior to that transfer are automatically considered unfair dismissals that entitle such employees to compensation as a result in order to avoid unfair dismissal claims we may have to offer and become liable for voluntary redundancy payments to the employees of our clients in the united kingdom and other eu countries who have adopted similar laws who outsource business to us this legislation may materially affect our ability to obtain new business from companies in the eu and to provide outsourced services to companies in the eu in a costeffective manner 

hostilities involving the united states the united kingdom and other countries in which we provide onsite services to our clients and other acts of terrorism violence or war could delay or reduce the number of new purchase orders we receive and impair our ability to service our customers thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

hostilities involving the united states and other acts of terrorism violence or war such as the attacks of september 11 2001 in the united states the attacks of july 7 2005 in the united kingdom and the continuing conflict in iraq could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to service our customers hostilities involving the united states the united kingdom and other countries in which we provide onsite services to our clients could cause customers in these countries to delay their decisions on it spending which could affect our financial results in addition acts of terrorism violence or war could give rise to military or travel disruptions and restrictions affecting our employees as of december 31 2007 a majority of our technical professionals were located in india and the vast majority of our technical professionals in the united states and europe were indian nationals who were able to work in the united states and europe only because they held current visas and work permits travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the united states and europe 

although we continue to believe that we have a strong competitive position in the united states we continue to increase our efforts to geographically diversify our clients and revenue despite our efforts to diversify hostilities involving the united states the united kingdom and other countries in which we provide onsite services to our clients and other acts of terrorism violence or war may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

our revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in the united states and europe as well as on clients concentrated in certain industries and economic slowdowns or factors that affect the economic health of the united states europe or these industries may affect our business 

approximately 83 of our revenues during the year ended december 31 2007 were derived from customers located in the united states in the same period approximately 16 of our revenues were derived from customers located in europe if the united states or european economy weakens or otherwise slows pricing for our services may be depressed and our customers may reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability additionally any recession in the united states economy could have an adverse impact on our revenues because a large portion of our revenues is derived from the united states in addition during the year ended december 31 2007 we earned approximately 47 of our revenues from the financial services and insurance industries any significant decrease in the growth of the financial services industry or significant consolidation in that industry or decrease in growth or consolidation in other industry segments on which we focus could reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

our ability to operate and compete effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel or if we cannot attract additional qualified personnel 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of the key members of our management team as well as marketing sales and technical personnel and our ability to attract and retain new management and other personnel we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or significant employees 

  

competition for personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting and retaining new personnel in the future the loss of any one or more of our key personnel or the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

restrictions in noncompetition agreements with our executive officers may not be enforceable 

we have entered into noncompetition agreements with our executive officers we cannot assure you however that the restrictions in these agreements prohibiting such executive officers from engaging in competitive activities are enforceable further substantially all of our professional nonexecutive staff are not covered by agreements that would prohibit them from working for our competitors if any of our key professional personnel leaves our employment and joins one of our competitors our business could be adversely affected 

our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate earnings in india 

effective january 1 2002 pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 23 “accounting for income taxesspecial areas” we no longer accrue incremental us taxes on all indian earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur in the future that could effectively force us to change our intent on repatriating indian earnings if we change our intent and repatriate such earnings we will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than our effective income tax rate in 2007 these increased taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

over the next few years we will lose certain tax benefits provided by india to companies in our industry 

our indian subsidiaries are exportoriented companies which under the indian income tax act of 1961 are entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each software technology park stp with respect to export profits for each stp substantially all of the earnings of our indian subsidiaries are attributable to export profits the majority of our stps in india are currently entitled to a 100 exemption from indian income tax under current law these tax holidays will be completely phased out by march 2009 in anticipation of the complete phase out of the tax holidays in march 2009 we expect to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as special economic zones sez development centers operating in sez will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods of up to 15 years under current indian tax law export profits after march 31 2009 from our existing stps will be fully taxable at the indian statutory rate 3399 as of december 31 2007 in effect at such time if the tax holidays relating to our indian stps are not extended or new tax incentives are not introduced that would effectively extend the income tax holiday benefits beyond march 2009 we expect that our effective income tax rate would increase significantly beginning in calendar year 2009 

if our pricing structures do not accurately anticipate the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions we contract to provide services either on a timeandmaterials basis or on a fixedprice basis our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and workforces in multiple locations and utilizing workforces with different skill sets and competencies across geographically distributed service locations our pricing cost and profit margin estimates for the work that we perform frequently include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract there is a risk that we will underprice our projects fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on our profit margin 

in addition a significant portion of our projects are on a fixedprice basis subjecting us to the foregoing risks to an even greater extent fixedprice contracts accounted for approximately 25 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 we expect that an increasing number of our future projects will be contracted on a fixedprice basis in addition to the other risks described in the paragraph above we bear the risk of cost overruns and operating cost inflation in connection with projects covered by fixedprice contracts our failure to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a fixedprice project or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within the time frame committed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

if we do not continue to improve our operational financial and other internal controls and systems to manage our rapid growth our business may suffer and the value of our shareholders’ investment may be harmed 

our anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources our growth will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls both in the united states india and elsewhere in particular our continued growth will increase the challenges involved in 

 

  

  

  

  

 as part of our growth strategy we are expanding our operations in europe asia and latin america we may not be able to compete effectively in these markets and the cost of entering these markets may be substantially greater than we expect if we fail to compete effectively in the new markets we enter or if the cost of entering those markets is substantially greater than we expect our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we cannot compete effectively we may be required to reconsider our strategy to invest in our international expansion plans and change our intent on the repatriation of our earnings 

we rely on a few customers for a large portion of our revenues 

our top five customers generated approximately 24 of our revenues for year ended december 31 2007 and 29 of our revenues in the fiscal year ended december 31 2006 the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a major customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year the loss of one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we generally do not have longterm contracts with our customers and our results of operations could be adversely affected if our clients terminate their contracts with us on short notice 

consistent with industry practice we generally do not enter into longterm contracts with our customers a majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice as a result we are substantially exposed to volatility in the market for our services and may not be able to maintain our level of profitability 

when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to eliminate associated costs in a timely manner consequently our profit margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected if we are unable to market our services on terms we find acceptable our financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing rates 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to recover for our services if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our profit margin and our profitability could suffer the rates we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

our operating results may experience significant quarterly fluctuations 

we historically have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations and expect these fluctuations to continue among the factors causing these variations have been 

 

  

  

  

 in addition our future revenues operating results and margins may fluctuate as a result of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a high percentage of our operating expenses particularly personnel and rent are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter as a result unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects or in employee wage levels and utilization rates may cause significant variations in our operating results in any particular quarter and could result in losses any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations any material reduction in utilization rates for our professional staff or variance in the onsite offshore staffing mix an unanticipated termination of a major project a customer’s decision not to pursue a new project or proceed to succeeding stages of a current project or the completion during a quarter of several major customer projects could require us to pay underutilized employees and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as a result of these factors it is possible that in some future periods our revenues and operating results may be significantly below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such an event the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable utilization rates 

the cost of providing our services including the utilization rate of our professionals affects our profitability if we are not able to maintain an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals our profit margin and our profitability may suffer our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

 liability claims for damages caused by disclosure of confidential information or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business 

many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s computer system could result in a claim for substantial 

  

damages against us regardless of our responsibility for the failure although we attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our it development and maintenance services we cannot assure you that any contractual limitations on liability will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages 

in addition we often have access to or are required to collect and store confidential client and customer data if any person including any of our employees penetrates our network security or misappropriates sensitive data we could be subject to significant liability from our clients or from our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data whether through breach of our computer systems systems failure or otherwise could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 

although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be sufficient in amount to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be subject to legacy dun  bradstreet liabilities that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

in 1996 the dun  bradstreet corporation split itself into three separate companies the dun  bradstreet corporation cognizant corporation and acnielsen corporation in connection with the splitup transaction the dun  bradstreet corporation cognizant corporation renamed nielsen media research of which we were once a part and acnielsen corporation now a subsidiary of the dutch company vnu na entered into a distribution agreement in the 1996 distribution agreement each party assumed the liabilities relating to the businesses allocated to it and agreed to indemnify the other parties and their subsidiaries against those liabilities and certain other matters the 1996 distribution agreement also prohibited each party thereto from distributing to our stockholders any business allocated to it unless the distributed business delivered undertakings agreeing to be jointly and severally liable to the other parties under the 1996 distribution agreement for the liabilities of the distributing parent company under the 1996 distribution agreement ims health made such undertaking when it was spun off by nielsen media research in 1998 and accordingly ims health and nielsen media research are jointly and severally liable to rh donnelly and acnielsen for cognizant corporation obligations under the terms of the 1996 distribution agreement ims health has requested similar undertakings from us as a condition to the distribution of our shares in the exchange offer ims health is obligated to procure similar undertakings from us to nielsen media research and synavant inc with respect to liabilities allocated to ims health in connection with nielsen media research’s spinoff of ims health and ims health’s spinoff of synavant inc in connection with the exchange offer we gave these undertakings and as a result we may be subject to claims in the future in relation to legacy liabilities 

claims have arisen in the past and may arise in the future under the 1996 distribution agreement or the distribution agreements relating to nielsen media research’s spinoff of ims health and ims health’s spinoff of synavant inc in which case we may be jointly and severally liable for any losses suffered by the parties entitled to indemnification ims health has agreed to indemnify us for any and all liabilities that arise out of our undertakings to be jointly and severally liable for these liabilities but if for any reason ims health does not perform on our indemnification obligation these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our business may be adversely affected 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property we presently hold no patents or registered copyrights and rely upon a combination of copyright and trade secret laws nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and various security measures to protect our intellectual property rights existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights india is a member of the berne convention and has agreed to recognize protections on copyrights conferred under the laws of foreign countries including the laws of the united states we believe that laws rules regulations and treaties in effect in the united states and india are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our copyrights however there can be no assurance that these laws will not change and in particular that the laws of india or the united states will not change in ways that may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components libraries and toolsets from india to the united states or from the united states to india there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of any of our intellectual property or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in development of technology products or services which compete with our products and unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products services or proprietary information if we are unable to protect our intellectual property our business may be adversely affected 

  

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we could have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients these claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions in a number of our contracts we have agreed to indemnify our clients for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area whether we ultimately win or lose could be timeconsuming and costly injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements we might not be able to enter into these royalty or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages we expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our competitors are able to obtain patents for software products and processes any infringement claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we could lose our ability or be unable to secure the right to utilize the intellectual property of others thirdparty suppliers of software hardware or other intellectual assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property or be acquired or used and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired our operating results could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to integrate acquired companies or technologies successfully and we may be subject to certain liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions that could harm our operating results 

we believe that opportunities exist in the fragmented it services market to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions and joint ventures we believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence especially in the european market enter new technology areas or expand our capacity we cannot assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices consummate any acquisition or joint venture or successfully integrate any acquired business or joint venture into our operations further acquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key personnel unanticipated events or circumstances and legal liabilities some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we may finance any future acquisitions with cash debt financing the issuance of equity securities or a combination of the foregoing we cannot assure you that we will be able to arrange adequate financing on acceptable terms in addition acquisitions financed with the issuance of our equity securities could be dilutive 

although we conduct due diligence in connection with each of our acquisitions there may be liabilities that we fail to discover or that we inadequately assess in our due diligence efforts in particular to the extent that prior owners of any acquired businesses or properties failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations or failed to fulfill their contractual obligations to customers we as the successor owner may be financially responsible for these violations and failures and may suffer reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected while we generally require the selling party to indemnify us for any and all liabilities associated with such liabilities if for any reason the seller does not perform their indemnification obligation we may be held responsible for such liabilities in addition as part of an acquisition we may assume responsibilities and obligations of the acquired business pursuant to the terms and conditions of services agreements entered by the acquired entity that are not consistent with the terms and conditions that we typically accept and require although we attempt to structure acquisitions in such a manner as to minimize the liability that could arise from such contractual commitments we cannot assure you that any of our efforts to minimize the liability will be effective in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages under such agreements the discovery of any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions for which we are unable to receive indemnification for could harm our operating results 

system failure or disruptions in telecommunications could disrupt our business and result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

to deliver our services to our customers we must maintain a high speed network of satellite fiber optic and land lines and active voice and data communications 24 hours a day between our main offices in chennai our other it development centers in india and globally and the offices of our customers worldwide although we maintain redundancy facilities and satellite communications links any systems failure or a significant lapse in our ability to transmit voice and data through satellite and telephone communications could result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

  

provisions in our charter bylaws and stockholders’ rights plan and provisions under delaware law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals 

provisions in our charter and bylaws each as amended our stockholders’ rights plan and delaware general corporate law or dgcl may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover proposals or delaying or preventing changes in our control or management including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices in addition these documents and provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests our board of directors has the authority without further action by the stockholders to fix the rights and preferences and issue shares of preferred stock our charter provides for a classified board of directors which will prevent a change of control of our board of directors at a single meeting of stockholders the prohibition of our stockholders’ ability to act by written consent and to call a special meeting will delay stockholder actions until annual meetings or until a special meeting is called by our chairman or chief executive officer or our board of directors the supermajorityvoting requirement for specified amendments to our charter and bylaws allows a minority of our stockholders to block those amendments the dgcl also contains provisions preventing stockholders from engaging in business combinations with us subject to certain exceptions these provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock 

compliance with new and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements adds uncertainty to our compliance policies and increases our costs of compliance 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to accounting corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 other sec regulations and the nasdaq global select market rules are creating uncertainty for companies like ours these laws regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such corporate governance standards 

in particular our efforts to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors’ audit of that assessment requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources we consistently assess the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting remediate any control deficiencies that may be identified and validate through testing that our controls are functioning as documented while we do not anticipate any material weaknesses the inability of management and our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy and effectiveness respectively of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure and our efforts to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities in addition the laws regulations and standards regarding corporate governance may make it more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with their performance of duties as a result we may face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which could harm our business if we fail to comply with new or changed laws regulations or standards of corporate governance our business and reputation may be harmed 

funds associated with auctionrate securities that we hold as investments may not be liquid or accessible for in excess of 12 months and our auctionrate securities may decline in value 

as of december 31 2007 our shortterm investments included 2828 million of aaarated auctionrate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans as of february 26 2008 we held 1763 million of aaarated auctionrate municipal debt securities of which approximately 95 of the underlying student loans are backed by the federal family education loan progam ffelp in addition the auctionrate municipal debt securities held by us are generally collateralized by assets that are in excess of the total par value of the security issue during the period february 14 2008 to february 26 2008 auctions failed for 711 million of the auctionrate securities held by us as investments there is no assurance that successful auctions on the remaining auctionrate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed 

  

the current instability in the credit markets may affect our ability to liquidate these securities in the short term the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security the underlying security matures or a buyer outside the auction process emerges we believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not necessarily a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities in addition we believe that any potential future unrealized gain or loss associated with these securities will be temporary and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of financial position however if such losses become permanent an impairment charge would be recorded to our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive summary 

in 2007 our revenues increased to 21356 million compared to 14243 million in 2006 net income increased to 3501 million or 115 per diluted share including stockbased compensation expense and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense net of tax equal to 012 per diluted share during 2007 this is compared to 2328 million or 077 per diluted share including stockbased compensation expense net of tax equal to 009 per diluted share during 2006 the key drivers of our revenue growth in 2007 were as follows 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 we saw a continued increase in demand from our customers for a broad range of it solutions particularly high performance web development initiatives and complex systems development engagements testing enterprise resource planning or erp infrastructure management business process outsourcing and business intelligence we finished the year with approximately 500 active clients compared to 400 as of december 31 2006 and increased the number of strategic clients by 20 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 107 we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate 5 million to 50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity our top five and top ten customers accounted for approximately 24 and 34 respectively of our total revenues in 2007 as compared to approximately 29 and 39 respectively for the year ended december 31 2006 as we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline over time 

in europe we continue to experience strong growth during 2007 our revenue from european customers increased by approximately 865 to approximately 3429 million compared to approximately 1839 million in 2006 in 2007 revenue from europe excluding the uk increased by approximately 729 million from approximately 489 million in 2006 to approximately 1218 million europe will continue to be an area of significant investment for us in 2008 as we see this region as a growth opportunity for the long term 

our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of and strong demand for offshore it software and services and business process outsourcing recent nasscom india’s national association of software and service companies reports state that india’s it software and services and business process outsourcing sectors were an estimated 313 billion industry in 2007 with it software and services exports and business process outsourcing exports growing 36 and 34 respectively in 2007 the indian it software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to grow to greater than 60 billion by the year 2010 

in 2007 our operating margin decreased to approximately 179 compared to 182 in 2006 excluding stockbased compensation costs of approximately 359 million and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 59 million operating margin in 2007 was approximately 198 this was in line with our historic targeted operating margin range excluding stockbased compensation costs and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 19 to 20 of total revenues historically we have invested our profitability above the 19 to 20 operating margin level which excludes stockbased compensation and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense back into our business which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth this investment is primarily focused in the areas of i hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise ii training our technical staff in a broader range of it service offerings iii strengthening our business analytic capabilities iv strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services v continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery and vi recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees in addition this investment includes maintaining a deep bench of resources trained in a broad range of service offerings to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects for 2008 we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our historical targeted operating margin levels back into the business 

in 2007 we experienced pressure on our cost structure due to the appreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar this is in addition to the continuing wage inflation primarily in india that we have experienced over the last several years approximately 31 of our global costs for the year ended december 31 2007 were denominated in the indian rupee the appreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar during 2007 had the effect of decreasing our operating margin by approximately 210 basis points or 21 percentage points in 2007 as compared to 2006 each additional 1 change in the exchange rate between the indian rupee and the us dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 25 basis points or 025 percentage points during 2007 we implemented actions that mitigated these negative cost trends including increasing our global utilization rates of our technical staff and reducing discretionary spending accordingly we believe this balanced response at current exchange rates will permit us to continue to maintain operating margins in our historic targeted operating margin range which excludes stockbased compensation costs and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 19 to 20 of total revenues and permit us to continue to make the necessary investments to continue to grow the company 

  

we finished the year with total headcount of approximately 55400 an increase of approximately 16600 over the prior year the increases in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs to meet the demand for our services are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in 2007 annualized turnover including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 15 for 2007 the majority of our turnover occurs in india as a result annualized attrition rates onsite at clients are below our global attrition rate in addition attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff we have experienced wage inflation in india which may continue in the future however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as indian wages represent approximately 20 of our total operating expenses 

our current india real estate development program now includes planned construction of approximately 43 million square feet of new space the expanded program which commenced during the quarter ended march 31 2007 includes the expenditure of approximately 330 million through the end of 2009 on land acquisition facilities construction and furnishings to build new stateoftheart it development centers in regions primarily designated as special economic zones located in india during 2008 we expect to spend approximately 250 million globally for capital expenditures the majority of which relates to our india real estate development program in addition we plan to selectively lease space in special economic zones located in india to take advantage of tax incentives and meet our capacity requirements 

at december 31 2007 we had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 6704 million and working capital of approximately 9015 million accordingly we do not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues during 2007 we repurchased 1054 million of our class a common stock under a 200 million stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors that expires in september 2008 stock repurchases under this program must be funded from working capital also in november 2007 we acquired marketrx inc or marketrx a usbased leading provider of data analytics and process outsourcing for initial net cash consideration of approximately 1359 million including direct transaction costs the marketrx acquisition will strengthen our life sciences industry expertise as well as our data analytics capabilities which we expect to leverage across multiple industries the operating results of marketrx included in our 2007 consolidated financial statements were immaterial in 2008 we will continue to look for acquisitions that will strengthen our presence in a particular geographic area and increase our capabilities in a specific technology or industry 

on september 17 2007 our board of directors declared a twoforone stock split which was effected by a 100 stock dividend paid on october 16 2007 to stockholders of record as of october 1 2007 the stock split has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and all applicable references as to the number of outstanding common shares and per share information have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split as if it occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented in addition our stockholders’ equity accounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect a reclassification of an amount equal to the par value of the increase in issued shares of class a common stock from the additional paidincapital account to the class a common stock account 

critical accounting estimates and risks 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixedbid contracts the allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes valuation of shortterm investments goodwill and other longlived assets assumptions used in valuing stockbased compensation arrangements contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts which are predominantly fixedpriced contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting under this method total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost cost to cost 

  

method this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations contract losses for all periods presented were immaterial 

stockbased compensation  under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected term over which stock options will be outstanding before they are exercised the expected volatility of our stock the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited and beginning in 2007 due to a recent tax law change in india the expected exercise proceeds for stockbased awards subject to the indian fringe benefit tax if actual results differ significantly from our estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance if any involves judgment as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate effective january 1 2007 we adopted financial interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of sfas no 109” fin 48 fin 48 contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement 

tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

our indian subsidiaries cognizant india are exportoriented companies which under the indian income tax act of 1961 are entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each software technology park stp with respect to export profits for each stp substantially all of the earnings of cognizant india are attributable to export profits the majority of our stps in india are currently entitled to a 100 exemption from indian income tax under current law these tax holidays will be completely phased out by march 2009 the incremental indian taxes related to the taxable stps have been incorporated into our effective income tax rate for 2007 in anticipation of the complete phase out of the tax holidays in march 2009 we expect to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as special economic zones sez development centers operating in sez will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years under current indian tax law export profits after march 31 2009 from our existing stps will be fully taxable at the indian statutory rate 3399 as of december 31 2007 in effect at such time if the tax holidays relating to our indian stps are not extended or new tax incentives are not introduced that would effectively extend the income tax holiday benefits beyond march 2009 we expect that our effective income tax rate would increase significantly beginning in calendar year 2009 

shortterm investments  as of december 31 2007 we had 3306 million in shortterm investments we have historically invested these amounts in municipal debt securities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction process and in corporate notes and bonds us government agencies bank time deposits and commercial paper meeting certain criteria we classify our marketable securities as availableforsale at the time of purchase and evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date we evaluate our investments periodically for possible otherthantemporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis the financial condition of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value of our availableforsale securities exceeds the fair market value of the securities and the decline in value is determined to be otherthantemporary 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative creditworthiness of each customer historical collections experience and other information including the aging of the receivables if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant when determining the fair value of our reporting units we utilize various assumptions including projections of future cash flows any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge as of december 31 2007 our goodwill balance was approximately 1488 million 

longlived assets  in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we review longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in general we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset if such assets were determined to be impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks most of our it development centers including a majority of our employees are located in india as a result we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights limitations on immigration programs the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potential geopolitical and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers we are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the inability of our management and our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline see part i item 1a “risk factors” 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data expressed for the three years ended december 31 2007 

dollars in thousands 

 

  

     

the following tables include certain nongaap financial measures namely income from operations on a nongaap basis excluding the impact of stockbased compensation resulting from the adoption of sfas no 123r and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense and net income on a nongaap basis excluding the impact of a onetime tax benefit related to the repatriation of indian earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 or the act these nongaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies in addition these nongaap measures the financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and reconciliations of our gaap financial statements to such nongaap measures should be carefully evaluated 

we seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin excluding stockbased compensation costs and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 19 to 20 of revenues accordingly we believe that nongaap income from operations excluding stockbased compensation costs and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance for our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes we use financial statements that do not include stockbased compensation expense stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense and the income tax benefit related to the repatriation of indian earnings for financial and operational decision making to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors further management believes that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures provides useful information to investors because our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2005 did not reflect the impact of the adoption of sfas no 123r and included a onetime tax benefit of approximately 124 million related to the repatriation of 60 million of indian earnings under the act moreover because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under sfas no 123r we believe that providing a nongaap financial measure that excludes stockbased compensation allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies accordingly we believe that the presentation of nongaap income from operations and nongaap net income when read in conjunction with our reported gaap income from operations and gaap net income can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 

a limitation of using nongaap income from operations and nongaap net income versus income from operations and net income reported in accordance with gaap is that nongaap income from operations excludes costs namely stockbased compensation and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense that are recurring and a onetime tax benefit of related to the repatriation of indian earnings under the act stockbased compensation and the related stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business in addition other companies may calculate nongaap financial measures differently than us thereby limiting the usefulness of this nongaap financial measure as a comparative tool we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from nongaap income from operations and nongaap net income and evaluating such nongaap financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap

 effective april 1 2007 a new fringe benefit tax was introduced in india that obligates us to pay upon exercise or distribution of shares under a stockbased compensation award a nonincome related tax on the appreciation of the award from date of grant to date of vest there is no cash cost to us as we recover the cost of the indian fringe benefit tax from the employee’s proceeds from the award under us gaap the stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense is required to be recorded as an operating expense and the related recovery of such tax from our employee is required to be recorded to stockholders’ equity as proceeds from a stockbased compensation award our future operating results may experience volatility as a result of the timing of exercise or distribution of shares related to stockbased compensation awards to our employees who worked or are working in india the amount of stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense recorded during 2007 was 59 million 

year ended december 31 2007 compared to year ended december 31 2006 

revenue  revenue increased by 499 or approximately 7113 million from approximately 14243 million during 2006 to approximately 21356 million in 2007 this increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the onsiteoffshore delivery model among an increasing number of industries continued strength in our customers’ discretionary spending and greater penetration in the european market revenue from customers existing as of december 31 2006 increased by approximately 6304 million and revenue from new customers added since december 31 2006 was approximately 809 million or approximately 38 of total revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 in addition revenue from european customers in 2007 increased by 1590 million as compared to 2006 we had approximately 500 active clients as of december 31 2007 as compared to approximately 400 active clients as of december 31 2006 in addition we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services with all of our business segments experiencing yearoveryear revenue growth between 473 and 527 our financial services and healthcare business segments accounted for approximately 3215 million and 1736 million respectively of the 7113 million increase in revenue our it consulting and technology services and it outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 484 and 514 respectively compared to 2006 and represented approximately 484 and 516 respectively of total revenues in 2007 

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense  our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries stockbased compensation expense and related stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense payroll taxes benefits immigration and projectrelated travel for technical personnel the cost of subcontracting and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues our cost of revenues increased by 531 or approximately 4181 million from approximately 7879 million during 2006 to approximately 12060 million in 2007 the increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately 3819 million 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries stockbased compensation expense and related stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense employee benefits travel promotion communications management finance administrative and occupancy costs as well as depreciation and amortization expense selling general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization increased by 452 or approximately 1706 million from approximately 3774 million during 2006 to approximately 5480 million during 2007 and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 265 in 2006 to approximately 257 in 2007 the percentage decrease was due primarily to economies of scale driven by increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization reductions in discretionary spending partially offset by of the appreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar and wage inflation primarily in india 

income from operations  income from operations increased 473 or approximately 1226 million from approximately 2589 million during 2006 to approximately 3815 million during 2007 representing operating margins of approximately 179 of revenues in 2007 and 182 of revenues in 2006 the decrease in operating margin was due primarily to appreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar and wage inflation primarily in india partially offset by 

  

cost containment actions such as control of discretionary spending and scale efficiencies including increased utilization rates of our technical staff and lower stockcompensation costs as a percentage of revenues excluding stockbased compensation expense of 359 million and stockbased indian fringe benefit tax expense of 59 million in 2007 and stockbased compensation expense of 299 million in 2006 operating margins for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 were 198 and 203 respectively

the company’s chief operating decision maker evaluates cognizant’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers certain expenses such as general and administrative and a portion of depreciation and amortization are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment further stockbased compensation expense and the related stockbased india fringe benefit tax are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as “unallocated” and adjusted only against the total income from operations

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2007 we had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 6704 million we have used and plan to use such cash for i expansion of existing operations including our offshore it development centers ii continued development of new service lines iii possible acquisitions of related businesses iv formation of joint ventures v stock repurchases and vi general corporate purposes including working capital as of december 31 2007 we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately 9015 million as compared to working capital of approximately 7909 million as of december 31 2006 accordingly we do not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues 

net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 3443 million for the year ended december 31 2007 2529 million for the year ended december 31 2006 and 1598 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in 2007 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2007 offset in part by slower collections of receivables the timing of payment of accrued expenses and the timing of billings of fixedprice contracts trade accounts receivable increased from approximately 1540 million at december 31 2005 to approximately 2592 million at december 31 2006 and to approximately 3830 million at december 31 2007 unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately 227 million at december 31 2005 to approximately 393 at december 31 2006 and to approximately 535 million at december 31 2007 the increase in trade accounts receivable during 2007 was due primarily to increased revenues and a higher number of days of sales outstanding unbilled receivables increased primarily due to increased revenue and the timing of billings for certain fixedprice contracts we monitor turnover aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff at december 31 2007 our days’ sales outstanding including unbilled receivables was approximately 67 days as compared to 65 days as of december 31 2006 and 63 days as of december 31 2005 

our investing activities used net cash of approximately 2773 million for the year ended december 31 2007 2723 million for the year ended december 31 2006 and 2045 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in each year was primarily related to greater investment to expand our offshore it development centers and in 2007 attributed to payments for the acquisition of marketrx and a contingent purchase price payment relating to our acquisition of fathom 

our financing activities provided net cash of approximately 40 million for the year ended december 31 2007 829 million for the year ended december 31 2006 and 475 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the decrease in 2007 relates primarily to class a common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program offset in part by higher proceeds and excess tax benefits from stock option exercises the increase in 2006 relates to the classification in 2006 of excess tax benefits on employee stock option exercises of approximately 332 million in financing activities as required by sfas no 123r 

as of december 31 2007 our shortterm investments included 2828 million of aaarated auctionrate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans as of february 26 2008 we held 1763 million in aaarated auctionrate municipal debt securities of which approximately 95 of the underlying student loans are backed by the federal family education loan program ffelp in addition the auctionrate municipal debt securities held by us are generally collateralized by assets that are in excess of the total par value of the security issue during the period february 14 2008 to february 26 2008 auctions failed for 711 million of the auctionrate securities held by us there is no assurance that successful auctions on the remaining auctionrate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed 

  

the current instability in the credit markets may affect our ability to liquidate these securities in the short term the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security the underlying security matures or a buyer outside the auction process emerges we believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not necessarily a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities in addition we believe that any potential future unrealized gain or loss associated with these securities will be temporary and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of financial position however if such losses become otherthantemporary an impairment charge would be recorded to our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 

we believe we will be able to recover our investment in auctionrate municipal debt securities due to i the strength of the underlying collateral substantially backed by ffelp ii the aaa credit rating of the securities held by us and iii recent news that certain municipal issuers of auctionrate securities with failed auctions have announced plans to call such securities all of the auctionrate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par if future auctions continue to fail we believe the issuers of the auctionrate securities held by us will begin to call these securities to avoid paying the higher penalty interest rates associated with failed auctions however it could take until the final maturity of the underlying security up to 33 years to realize our investments’ recorded value based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months 

our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our longterm capital requirements beyond a 12month period will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from india and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we cannot be certain that additional financing if required will be available on terms favorable to us if at all 

commitments and contingencies 

our current india real estate development program now includes planned construction of approximately 43 million square feet of new space the expanded program which commenced during the quarter ended march 31 2007 includes the expenditure of approximately 330 million through the end of 2009 on land acquisition facilities construction and furnishings to build new stateoftheart it development centers in regions primarily designated as special economic zones located in india as of december 31 2007 we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately 1267 million related to our india development center expansion program 

during 2007 we repurchased 1054 million of our class a common stock under a 200 million stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors that expires in september 2008 any future repurchases under this program will be funded from cash generated from operations 

as of december 31 2007 we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

  

    

as of december 31 2007 we had 79 million of unrecognized tax benefits this represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken or expected to be taken on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution the resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management the outcome of such claims and legal actions if decided adversely is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results cash flows or consolidated financial position additionally many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our application design development and maintenance services there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results financial position and cash flows 

foreign currency translation 

overall we believe that we are not exposed to significant revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign exchange rates as approximately 83 of our revenues are generated from customers located in north america however a portion of our costs in india representing approximately 31 of our global operating costs are denominated in local currency and subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which has an impact on our results of operations in addition a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which results in nonoperating foreign exchange gains and losses on an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the indian rupee in our indian subsidiary 

effects of inflation 

our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals competition in india the united states and europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation as with other it service providers we must adequately anticipate wage increases particularly on our fixedprice contracts there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the united states and elsewhere we have experienced wage inflation in india however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as indian wages represent approximately 20 of our total operating expenses 

recent accounting pronouncements 

on january 1 2007 we adopted fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that is required to be met before being recognized in the financial statements fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the cumulative effect of adopting fin 48 of 085 million was recorded as a reduction of beginning retained earnings 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 141r business combinations this statement replaces fasb statement no 141 business combinations sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquiring company recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas no 141r further changes the accounting treatment for certain specific items including acquisition costs will be generally expensed as incurred acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for nonacquired contingencies inprocess research and development iprd will be recorded at fair value as an indefinitelived intangible asset at the acquisition date restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be generally expensed 

  

subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense sfas no 141r applies prospectively to our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january 1 2009 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 51” “sfas no 160” sfas no 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated sfas no 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners sfas no 160 is effective for us beginning january 1 2009 we are currently evaluating the potential impact that sfas no 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” sfas no 159 which is effective for our financial statements beginning january 1 2008 sfas no 159 permits entities to measure eligible financial assets financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value on an instrumentbyinstrument basis that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other generally accepted accounting principles the fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings we are currently evaluating the potential impact that sfas no 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 however on february 12 2008 the fasb issued fsp sfas no 1572 which delays the effective date of sfas no 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually this fsp partially defers the effective date of sfas no 157 to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp effective for 2008 we will adopt sfas no 157 except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in fsp sfas no 1572 we are currently evaluating the potential impact that sfas no 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements

tablestart 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies including the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations and may use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies in 2007 2006 and 2005 we have not entered into any hedging contracts or offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources 

we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 6704 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments most of which are impacted almost immediately by changes in shortterm interest rates we limit our credit risk by investing primarily in aaaaaa rated securities as rated by moody’s standard  poor’s and fitch rating services and restricting amounts that can be invested with any single issuer 

  

as of december 31 2007 our shortterm investments included 2828 million of aaarated auctionrate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans as of february 26 2008 we held 1763 million in aaarated auctionrate municipal debt securities of which approximately 95 of the underlying student loans are backed by the ffelp in addition the auctionrate municipal debt securities held by us are generally collateralized by assets that are in excess of the total par value of the security issue during the period february 14 2008 to february 26 2008 auctions failed for 711 million of the auctionrate securities held by us as investments there is no assurance that successful auctions on the remaining auctionrate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed 

the current instability in the credit markets may affect our ability to liquidate these securities in the short term the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security the underlying security matures up to 33 years or a buyer outside the auction process emerges we believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not necessarily a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities in addition we believe that any potential future unrealized gain or loss associated with these securities will be temporary and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of financial position however if such losses become otherthantemporary an impairment charge would be recorded to our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are a leading provider of custom it consulting and technology services as well as outsourcing services for global 2000 companies located in north america europe and asia our core competencies include technology strategy consulting complex systems development enterprise software package implementation and maintenance data warehousing and business intelligence application testing application maintenance infrastructure management and verticallyoriented business process outsourcing vbpo we tailor our services to specific industries and utilize an integrated onsiteoffshore business model this seamless onsiteoffshore business model combines technical and account management teams located onsite at the customer location and offshore at dedicated development centers located primarily in india 

industry background 

many companies today face intense competitive pressure and rapidly changing market dynamics driven by such factors as changes in government regulations globalization and technology innovation in response to these challenges many companies are focused on improving productivity increasing service levels lowering costs and accelerating delivery times in order to achieve these goals companies are focusing on a number of technologycentric areas such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these approaches and technologies facilitate faster more responsive lowercost business operations however their development integration and ongoing maintenance present major challenges and require a large number of highly skilled professionals trained in many diverse technologies in addition companies also require additional technical resources to maintain enhance and reengineer their core legacy it systems and to address application maintenance projects increasingly companies are relying on custom it solutions providers such as us to provide these services 

in order to respond effectively to a changing and challenging business environment it departments of many companies have focused increasingly on improving returns on it investments lowering costs and accelerating the delivery of new systems and solutions to accomplish these objectives many it departments have shifted all or a portion of their it development integration and maintenance requirements to outside service providers operating with onsiteoffshore business models 

global demand for high quality lower cost it services from outside providers has created a significant opportunity for it service providers that can successfully leverage the benefits of and address the challenges in using an offshore talent pool the effective use of offshore personnel can offer a variety of benefits including lower costs faster delivery of new it solutions and innovations in vertical solutions processes and technologies certain developing countries particularly india have a large talent pool of highly qualified technical professionals that can provide high quality it and bpo services at a lower cost india is a leader in it services and is regarded as having one of the largest and highest quality pools of talent in the world historically it service providers have used offshore labor pools primarily to supplement the internal staffing needs of customers however evolving customer demands have led to the increasing acceptance and use of offshore resources for higher valueadded services these services include application design development testing integration and maintenance as well as technology consulting and infrastructure management india’s services and software exports continue to see significant growth according to nasscom india’s national association of software and services companies the itbpo sector in india was an estimated 247 billion industry in 2006 and is projected to grow to greater than 60 billion by 2010 

using a globally distributed workforce to provide valueadded services presents a number of challenges to it service providers the offshore implementation of valueadded it services requires that it service providers continually and effectively attract train and retain highly skilled software development professionals with the advanced technical skills 

  

necessary to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences these skills are necessary to design develop and deploy highquality technology solutions in a costeffective and timely manner in addition it service providers must have the methodologies processes and communications capabilities to enable offshore workforces to be successfully integrated with onsite personnel service providers must also have strong research and development capabilities technology competency centers and relationship management skills in order to compete effectively 

the cognizant approach 

our business is organized and managed primarily around our four verticallyoriented business segments 

 

  

  

  

 this vertical focus has been central to our revenue growth and high customer satisfaction as the it services industry continues to mature clients are looking for service providers who understand their businesses industry initiatives culture and have solutions tailored to meet their individual business needs we have continued to hire experts out of industry establish a broad base of business analysts invest in industry training for our staff and build out industryspecific services and solutions this approach is central to our highlevels of ontime delivery and customer satisfaction as we understand the full context of our clients’ challenges and have deep experience in addressing them 

our key service areas—it consulting and technology services and outsourcing services—are delivered to our clients across our four business segments in a standardized highquality manner through a global delivery model these service areas include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

business segments 

we are organized around industry verticals and we report the operations of our business in the following four business segments 

 

 financial services 

in 2006 our financial services business segment represented approximately 48 of our total revenues this business segment provides services to our customers operating in the following industries 

 

  

  

 healthcare 

in 2006 our healthcare business segment represented approximately 23 of our total revenues this business segment provides services to our customers operating in the following industries 

 

  

 manufacturing  retail  logistics 

in 2006 our manufacturing logistics  retail business segment represented approximately 15 of our total revenues this business segment services customers in the following industry groups 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 other 

the other reportable business segment is an aggregation of operating segments which individually are less than 10 of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit the other business segment includes telecommunications information services media and high technology operating segments in 2006 our other reportable business segment represented approximately 14 of our total revenues a description of operating segments included in other is as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our solution and services 

we believe that we have developed an effective integrated onsiteoffshore business model and that this business model will be a critical element of our continued growth to support this business model at december 31 2006 we employed over 38800 it professionals and support staff globally we have also established facilities technology and communications infrastructure in order to support our business model 

across each of our business segments we provide a broad and expanding range of consulting information technology and business processing outsourcing services including 

  

it consulting and technology services 

 

  

  

  

 in both of these approaches our onsite team members work closely and collaboratively with our clients detailed design implementation and testing are generally performed offshore at our 28 it development centers located in india and china as well as our development centers in boston chicago phoenix amsterdam and toronto in addition we maintain an onsite presence at each customer location in order to address evolving customer needs and resulting changes to the project 

a key part of our application development and integration offering is a suite of services to help organizations build and integrate business applications with the rest of their operations in this suite of services we leverage our skills in business application development and enterprise application integration to build sophisticated business applications and to integrate these new applications and web sites with client server and legacy systems we build and deploy robust scalable and extensible architectures for use in a wide range of industries we maintain competency centers specializing in microsoft ibm sap and java among others in order to be able to provide application development and integration services to a broad spectrum of customers 

our reengineering service offerings assist customers migrating from systems based on legacy computing environments to newer open systemsbased platforms and clientserver architectures often in response to the more stringent demands of business our reengineering tools automate many of the processes required to implement advanced clientserver technologies we believe that this automation substantially reduces the time and cost to perform reengineering services savings that benefit both us and our customers these tools also enable us to perform source code analysis and to redesign target databases and convert certain programming languages if necessary our programmers also help customers redesign and convert user interfaces 

 

 outsourcing 

 

 we provide services to help ensure that a customer’s core operational systems are free of defects and responsive to the customer’s changing needs as part of this process we are often able to introduce product and process enhancements and improve service levels to customers requesting modifications and ongoing support 

our onsiteoffshore business model enables us to provide a range of rapid response and costeffective support services to our customers our onsite team members often provide helpdesk services at the customer’s facility these team members typically carry pagers in the event of an emergency service request and are available to quickly resolve customer problems from remote locations in the case of more complex maintenance services including modifications enhancements and documentation which typically have longer turnaround times we take full advantage of our offshore resources to develop solutions more costeffectively than would be possible relying on higher cost local professionals the services provided by our offshore team members are delivered to customers using satellite and fiberoptic telecommunications 

  

as part of our application maintenance services we assist customers in renovating their core systems to meet the requirements imposed by new regulations new standards or other external events these services include or have previously included year 2000 compliance eurocurrency compliance decimalization within the securities industry and compliance with the health insurance portability and accountability act for the healthcare industry 

we seek to anticipate the operational environment of customer’s it systems as we design and develop such systems we also offer diagnostic services to customers to assist them in identifying shortcomings in their it systems and optimizing the performance of their systems 

 

  

 in addition to our industryspecific expertise and focus our strengths which we believe differentiate us from other it service providers include the following 

established and scalable proprietary processes we have developed proprietary methodologies for integrating onsite and offshore teams to facilitate costeffective ontime delivery of highquality projects these methodologies comprise our proprietary qview software engineering process which is available to all onsite and offshore programmers we use this iso 90012000 certified process to define and implement projects from the design development and deployment stages through ongoing application maintenance for most projects qview is used as part of an initial setting up of processes that allows us to define the scope and risks of the project and subdivide the project into smaller phases with frequent deliverables and feedback from customers we also use our qview process to detect mitigate and correct possible quality defects and to establish appropriate contingencies for each project in order to ensure implementation of the quality process we assign a quality facilitator to each project who reports to a centralized quality assurance and software engineering group this group performs on a sample basis quality audits deliverables verifications metrics collection and analysis which are used to improve processes and methodologies these processes and methodologies have proven to be scalable as we have significantly increased the number of offshore development centers customers and projects in addition all of our principal development centers have been assessed by kpmg llp at level 5 the highest possible rating of both the capability maturity model and the capability maturity model integration of the software engineering institute at carnegie mellon university which are widely recognized means of measuring the quality and maturity of an organization’s software development and maintenance processes in addition all of our principal development centers have been certified by the stqc directorate ministry of communications and information technology government of india the accreditation authority for companies in india under the internationally recognized bs 7799 part 22002 information security standards a comprehensive set of controls comprising best practices in information security and business continuity planning our quality management system has also been certified by kpmg to international standard iso 90012000 of the international organization for standardization an internationally recognized standard for quality management systems directed to the achievement of business results including satisfaction of customers and others in addition in late 2006 through our coimbatore facility cognizant became the first company to achieve maturity level 5 of cmmi v12 model of scampi v12 

highly skilled workforce our managers and senior technical personnel provide indepth project management expertise to customers to maintain this level of expertise we have placed significant emphasis on recruiting and training our workforce of highly skilled professionals we have over 3000 project managers and senior technical personnel around the world many of whom have significant work experience in north america europe and asia we also maintain programs and personnel to hire and train the best available technical professionals in both legacy systems and emerging technologies we provide five months of combined classroom and onthejob training to newly hired programmers as well as additional annual 

  

training programs designed to enhance the business practices tools technology and consulting skills of our professional staff we were recently assessed by kpmg at level 5 the highest possible rating of the people capability maturity model pcmm of the software engineering institute at carnegie mellon university a widely recognized means of implementing best current practices in fields such as human resources knowledge management and organizational development which improves our processes for managing and developing our workforce and addressing critical people issues 

research and development and competency centers  we have project experience and expertise across multiple architectures and technologies and have made significant investments in our competency centers and in research and development to keep abreast of the latest technology developments most of our programmers are trained in multiple technologies and architectures as a result we are able to react to customers’ needs quickly and efficiently redeploy programmers to different technologies in order to develop and maintain this flexibility we have made a substantial investment in our competency centers where the experience gained from particular projects and research and development efforts is leveraged across our entire organization in addition through our investment in research and development activities and the continuing education of our technical personnel we enlarge our knowledge base and develop the necessary skills to keep pace with emerging technologies we believe that our ability to work in new technologies allows us to foster longterm relationships by having the capacity to continually address the needs of both existing and new customers 

welldeveloped infrastructure our extensive facilities technology and communications infrastructure facilitate the seamless integration of our onsite and offshore workforces this is accomplished by permitting team members in different locations to access common project information and to work directly on customer projects this infrastructure allows for 

 

  

  

  

 international time differences enable our offshore teams located in india to access a customer’s computing facilities located in north america europe and the asia pacific region during offpeak hours this ability to perform services during offpeak hours enables us to complete projects more rapidly and does not require our customers to invest in duplicative hardware and software in addition for large projects with short time frames our offshore facilities allow for parallel processing of various development phases to accelerate delivery time in addition we can deliver services more rapidly than some competitors without an offshore labor pool because our lower labor costs enable us to costeffectively assign more professionals to a project 

business strategies 

our objectives are to maximize stockholder value and enhance our position as a leading provider of custom it services we implement the following core strategies to achieve these objectives 

further develop longterm customer relationships we have strong longterm strategic relationships with our customers and business partners we seek to establish longterm relationships that present recurring revenue opportunities frequently trying to establish relationships with our customers’ chief information officers or other it decision makers by offering a wide array of costeffective high quality services approximately 96 of our revenues in the year ended december 31 2006 were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2005 we also seek to leverage our experience with a customer’s it systems into new business opportunities knowledge of a customer’s processes and it systems gained during the performance of application maintenance services for example may provide us with a competitive advantage in securing additional development and maintenance projects from that customer 

expand service offerings and solutions we have several teams dedicated to developing new high value services these teams collaborate with customers to develop these services for example we are currently developing new offerings in business consulting and it consulting verticallyoriented business process outsourcing and verticallyoriented it solutions atop innovative technologies including rfid service oriented architectures soa and open source in addition we invest in internal research and development and promote knowledge building and sharing across the organization in order to promote the development of new services and solutions that we can offer to our customers furthermore we continue to enhance our capabilities and service offerings in the areas of 

 

  

  

  

  

   

we believe that the continued expansion of our service offerings will reduce our reliance on any one technology initiative and will help foster longterm relationships with our customers by allowing us to serve their needs better 

enhance processes methodologies and productivity toolsets we are committed to improving and enhancing our proprietary qview software engineering process and other methodologies and toolsets in light of the rapid evolution of technology we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our continued success we are constantly designing and developing additional productivity software tools to automate testing processes and improve project estimation and risk assessment techniques in addition we use groupware technology to share project experience and best practice methodologies across the organization with the objective of improving productivity 

expand domestic and international geographic presence  as we expand our customer base we plan to open additional sales and marketing offices in north america europe and asia it is expected that this expansion will facilitate sales and service to existing and new customers we have established sales and marketing offices in atlanta boston chicago dallas minneapolis phoenix los angeles norwalk san francisco and teaneck in addition we have been pursuing market opportunities internationally through our offices in toronto london frankfurt paris zurich geneva amsterdam shanghai tokyo melbourne and singapore

pursue selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances  we believe that opportunities exist in the fragmented it services market to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances we believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence and our capabilities more rapidly especially in geographic markets and key industries for example in 2006 we acquired aimnet solutions a leading it infrastructure management services firm based in holliston massachusetts to provide us and our customers with further depth in it infrastructure management services in addition through our working relationships with independent software vendors we obtain projects using the detailed knowledge we gain in connection with a joint development process finally we will continue to strategically partner with select it service firms that offer complementary services in order to best meet the requirements of our customers

on january 30 2003 we filed a tender offer in which ims health stockholders could exchange ims health shares held by them for our class b common stock held by ims health

 item 1a risk factors 

additional factors that may affect future results 

if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india and we are subject to regulatory economic and political uncertainties in india 

we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india where as of december 31 2006 a majority of our technical professionals were located while wage costs are lower in india than in the united states and other developed countries for comparably skilled professionals wages in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states which could result in our incurring increased costs for technical professionals and reduced operating margins in addition there is intense competition in india for skilled technical professionals and we expect that competition to increase 

india has also experienced civil unrest and terrorism and has been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries in recent years there have been military confrontations between india and pakistan that have occurred in the region of kashmir and along the indianpakistan border the potential for hostilities between the two countries has been high in light of tensions related to recent terrorist incidents in india and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment including events in and related to afghanistan and iraq if india were to become engaged in armed hostilities particularly if these hostilities were protracted or involved the threat of or use of weapons of mass destruction our operations would be materially adversely affected in addition us companies may decline to contract with us for services in light of international terrorist incidents or armed hostilities even where india is not involved because of more generalized concerns about relying on a service provider utilizing international resources 

in the past the indian economy has experienced many of the problems confronting the economies of developing countries including high inflation erratic gross domestic product growth and shortages of foreign exchange the indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy and indian government actions concerning the economy could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities including us in the past the indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy including the software development services industry programs that have benefited us include among others tax holidays liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation notwithstanding these benefits india’s central and state governments remain significantly involved in the indian economy as regulators the elimination of any of the benefits realized by us from our indian operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are investing substantial cash assets in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately 

as of december 31 2006 we had contractual commitments of approximately 577 million related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our development centers in november 2006 we announced plans to invest approximately 200 million in new fullyowned development centers we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability will be reduced 

our international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties 

revenues from customers outside north america represented approximately 14 of our revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2006 13 of our revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 and 13 of our revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 we anticipate that revenues from customers outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence particularly in europe in addition a majority of our employees and almost all of our it development centers are located in india as a result we may be subject to risks associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions from time to time we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate our risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs 

  

quotas and other barriers and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in addition we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations we may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture our international expansion plans may not be successful and we may not be able to compete effectively in other countries there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

although we report our operating results in us dollars a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on us because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues expenses and income as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies will affect our revenues before reimbursements operating income and the value of balancesheet items originally denominated in other currencies there is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations or that any efforts by us to engage in currency hedging activities would be effective in addition in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which could limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations finally as we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services an increase in the value of certain currencies such as the indian rupee against the us dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at offshore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency 

we face intense competition from other it service providers 

the intensely competitive it professional services market includes a large number of participants and is subject to rapid change this market includes participants from a variety of market segments including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the market also includes numerous smaller local competitors in the various geographic markets in which we operate our direct competitors who use the onsiteoffshore business model include among others infosys technologies tata consultancy services and wipro in addition many of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do some of these larger competitors such as accenture electronic data systems and ibm global services have offshore operations we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our current levels of profitability or growth as competitive pressures including competition for skilled it development professionals and pricing pressure from competitors employing an onsiteoffshore business model increase 

we may not be able to sustain our current level of profitability 

for the year ended december 31 2006 we had an operating margin of 182 compared to an operating margin of 201 for year ended december 31 2005 our operating margin has declined as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r which required us to record stock compensation expense for stock option grants in our consolidated statement of operations effective january 1 2006 our operating margin may decline further if we experience declines in demand and pricing for our services in addition wages in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states which could result in us incurring increased costs for technical professionals additionally the number of stock options issued and the assumptions used in the stock option pricing model may change resulting in increased stock option expense and lower margins although we have been able to partially offset wage increases and foreign currency fluctuations through further leveraging of our lowcost operating structure obtaining price increases and issuing a lower number of options than in earlier years we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 

  

our business will suffer if we fail to develop new services and enhance our existing services in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological environment 

the it services market is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions our future success will depend on our ability to develop solutions that keep pace with changes in the it services market we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing new services addressing evolving technologies on a timely or costeffective basis or if these services are developed that we will be successful in the marketplace in addition we cannot assure you that products services or technologies developed by others will not render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to remain competitive will also depend on our ability to design and implement in a timely and costeffective manner solutions for customers moving from the mainframe environment to clientserver or other advanced architectures our failure to design and implement solutions in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may face difficulties in providing endtoend business solutions for our clients that could cause clients to discontinue their work with us which in turn could harm our business 

we have been expanding the nature and scope of our engagements and have added new service offerings such as it consulting business process outsourcing systems integration and outsourcing of entire portions of it infrastructure the success of these service offerings is dependent in part upon continued demand for such services by our existing and new clients and our ability to meet this demand in a costcompetitive and effective manner in addition our ability to effectively offer a wider breadth of endtoend business solutions depends on our ability to attract existing or new clients to these service offerings to obtain engagements for such endtoend solutions we also are more likely to compete with large wellestablished international consulting firms resulting in increased competition and marketing costs accordingly we cannot be certain that our new service offerings will effectively meet client needs or that we will be able to attract existing and new clients to these service offerings 

the increased breadth of our service offerings may result in larger and more complex projects with our clients this will require us to establish closer relationships with our clients and a thorough understanding of their operations our ability to establish such relationships will depend on a number of factors including the proficiency of our it professionals and our management personnel our failure to understand our client requirements or our failure to deliver services which meet the requirements specified by our clients could result in termination of client contracts and we could be liable to our clients for significant penalties or damages 

larger projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements these terminations cancellations or delays may result from the business or financial condition of our clients or the economy generally as opposed to factors related to the quality of our services such cancellations or delays make it difficult to plan for project resource requirements and inaccuracies in such resource planning may have a negative impact on our profitability 

our results of operations may be affected by the rate of growth in the use of technology in business and the type and level of technology spending by our clients 

our business depends in part upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients and their customers and suppliers in challenging economic environments our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new technologies in order to focus on other priorities at the same time many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting commerce and exchanging information and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel processes and infrastructures if the growth of use of technology in business or our clients’ spending on technology in business declines or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new technology solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected 

competition for highly skilled technical personnel is intense and the success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled professionals 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highly skilled it development professionals in particular we need to attract train and retain project managers it engineers and other senior technical personnel we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for it development professionals in the united states and india with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer we have subcontracted to a limited extent in the past and may do so in the future with other service providers in order to meet our 

  

obligations to our customers our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend in large part on our ability to attract train and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences further we must train and manage our growing work force requiring an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel we cannot assure you that the management skills and systems currently in place will be adequate or that we will be able to train and assimilate new employees successfully our failure to attract train and retain current or future employees could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our growth may be hindered by immigration restrictions 

our future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills from developing countries especially india the vast majority of our it professionals in the united states and in europe are indian nationals the ability of indian nationals to work in the united states depends on their ability and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits 

the h1b visa classification enables us employers to hire qualified foreign workers in positions that require an education at least equal to a baccalaureate degree in the united states in specialty occupations such as it systems engineering and systems analysis the h1b visa usually permits an individual to work and live in the united states for a period of up to six years there is a limit on the number of new h1b petitions that united states citizenship and immigration services or cis one of the successor agencies to the immigration and naturalization service may approve in any federal fiscal year and in years in which this limit is reached we may be unable to obtain h1b visas necessary to bring foreign employees to the united states in the current federal fiscal year the limit is 65000 the fiscal year 2007 cap was reached on may 26 2006 the fy 2007 cap of 20000 for graduates of us advance degree programs was reached on july 26 2006 we will be able to file h1b applications against the fy 2008 cap beginning on april 1 2007 for work in h1b status beginning on october 1 2007 each year the h1b cap is reached at an earlier point prior to the beginning of the fiscal year for which the h1b’s will be available however as a part of our advanced planning process we believe that we have sufficient employees visaready to meet our anticipated business growth in the current year in addition there are strict labor regulations associated with the h1b visa classification higher users of the h1b visa program are subject to investigations by the wage and hour division of the united states department of labor a finding by the united states department of labor of willful or substantial failure by us to comply with existing regulations on the h1b classification may result in backpay liability substantial fines andor a ban on future use of the h1b program and other immigration benefits 

we also regularly transfer employees of our subsidiary in india to the united states to work on projects and at client sites using the l1 visa classification the l1 visa allows companies abroad to transfer certain managers executives and employees with specialized company knowledge to related us companies such as a parent subsidiary affiliate joint venture or branch office we have an approved “blanket l program” under which the corporate relationships of our transferring and receiving entities have been preapproved by the cis thus enabling individual l1 applications to be presented directly to a us consular post abroad rather than undergoing the preapproval process in the united states in recent years both the us consular posts that review initial l1 applications and the cis offices which adjudicate extensions of l1 status have become more restrictive with respect to this category as a result the rate of refusals of initial l1 applications and of extensions has increased in addition even where l1 visas are ultimately granted and issued security measures undertaken by us consular posts around the world have delayed visa issuances our inability to bring qualified technical personnel into the united states to staff onsite customer locations would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

on december 8 2004 president bush signed the l1 visa reform act which was part of the fy 2005 omnibus appropriations act public law 108447 at division j title iv this legislation contained several important changes to the laws governing l1 visa holders all of the changes took effect on june 8 2005 under one provision of the new law all l1 applicants including those brought to the united states under a blanket l program must have worked abroad with the related company for one full year in the prior three years the provision allowing blanket l applicants who had worked abroad for the related company for six months during the qualifying threeyear period was revoked in addition l1b holders intracompany transferees with specialized company knowledge may not be primarily stationed at the work site of another employer if the l1b holder will be controlled and supervised by an employer other than the petitioning employer finally l1b status may not be granted where placement of the l1b visa holder at a third party site is part of an arrangement to provide labor for the third party rather than placement at the site in connection with the provision of a product or service involving specialized knowledge specific to the petitioning employer 

we do not place l1b workers at third party sites where they are under the supervision of a different employer nor do we place l1b holders at third party sites in an arrangement to provide labor for the third party without providing a service involving our specialized knowledge since implementation of the new law we have not encountered any difficulty in 

  

establishing this fact to cis’s satisfaction however the united states department of state is still in the process of implementing this provision at us consular posts abroad if these posts decide to interpret these provisions in a very restrictive fashion this could impair our ability to staff our projects in the united states with resources from our entities abroad in addition cis has not yet issued regulations governing these new provisions if such regulations are restrictive in nature this could impair our ability to staff our projects in the united states with resources from our entities abroad 

we also process immigrant visas for lawful permanent residence for employees to fill positions for which there are no able willing and qualified us workers available to fill the positions compliance with existing us immigration and labor laws or changes in those laws making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting our ability to successfully obtain permanent residence for our foreign employees in the united states could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the united states any of these restrictions or limitations on our hiring practices could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to immigration restrictions in the united states there are certain restrictions on transferring our employees to work in the united kingdom where we have experienced significant growth the united kingdom requires that employees who are not nationals of the european economic area eea which includes nationals of all european union countries except bulgaria and romania plus iceland norway liechtenstein and switzerland to obtain an intracompany transfer work permit before beginning to perform work under the work permit regulations in order for us to transfer our noneea employees to the united kingdom we must demonstrate that the employee had been employed by us for at least six months prior to the transfer and that the position in the united kingdom requires someone with either 1 a united kingdom degree level qualification or 2 a higher national diploma hnd level occupational qualification which is relevant to the uk position or 3 a general hnd level qualification plus one year’s work experience doing the type of job for which the work permit is sought or 4 at least three years’ highlevel specialist skills acquired through doing the type of job for which the work permit is sought these restrictions restrain our ability to add the skilled professionals we need for our operations in europe and could have an adverse affect on our international strategy to expand our presence in europe as a result the work permit legislation in the united kingdom could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the united states the united kingdom and other countries are subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement immigration and work permit laws and regulation can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity our international expansion strategy and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with it professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violation of these regulations could harm our business 

because we provide services to clients throughout the world we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal rules on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations violations of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our customers 

the issue of outsourcing of services abroad by us companies is a topic of political discussion in the united states measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by us companies are under discussion in congress and in numerous state legislatures while no substantive antioutsourcing legislation has been introduced to date given the ongoing debate over this issue the introduction of such legislation is possible if introduced such measures are likely to fall within two categories 1 a broadening of restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly andor 2 measures that impact private industry such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions in the event that any of these measures become law our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and our ability to service our customers could be impaired 

  

an economic slowdown hostilities involving the united states and other acts of terrorism violence or war could delay or reduce the number of new purchase orders we receive and impair our ability to service our customers thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

approximately 86 of our revenue during the year ended december 31 2006 was derived from customers located in the united states in the event of an economic slowdown our customers may delay or reduce their it spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and could have a material adverse affect on our financial results further hostilities involving the united states and other acts of terrorism violence or war such as the attacks of september 11 2001 in the united states the attacks of july 7 2005 in the united kingdom and the continuing conflict in iraq could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to service our customers hostilities involving the united states could cause customers in the united states to delay their decisions on it spending which could affect our financial results in addition acts of terrorism violence or war could give rise to military or travel disruptions and restrictions affecting our employees as of december 31 2006 a majority of our technical professionals were located in india and the vast majority of our technical professionals in the united states and europe are indian nationals who are able to work in the united states and europe only because they hold current visas and work permits travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the united states and europe 

although we continue to believe that we have a strong competitive position in the united states we continue to increase our efforts to geographically diversify our clients and revenue despite our efforts to diversify an economic slowdown hostilities involving the united states and other acts of terrorism violence or war may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

our inability to employ and effectively implement the right systems processes and tools to manage our large and expanding enterprise could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in 2006 we began implementing new financial and human resource software systems to improve our organizational processes internal controls and efficiency and accommodate our anticipated growth additionally to streamline our general and administration infrastructure and costs as a percentage of revenue and ensure that we can appropriately scale our operations as our business expands we are redesigning many operational processes and transitioning certain internal nonbillable roles to our offices in india these activities principally relate to finance human resources and certain it functions if we do not timely efficiently and effectively upgrade or replace systems redesign processes and implement the preceding role transitions as our business requires we may be unable to support our growth effectively or realize cost savings as quickly as expected and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting additionally the quality of our services may decline and our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired if we are unable to successfully complete these initiatives if we do not continue to employ and effectively implement the right systems processes and tools to manage our large and expanding enterprise it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to operate and compete effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of the key members of our management team as well as marketing sales and technical personnel and our ability to attract and retain new management and other personnel we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or significant employees competition for personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting and retaining new personnel in the future the loss of any one or more of our key personnel or the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

restrictions in noncompetition agreements with our executive officers may not be enforceable 

we have entered into noncompetition agreements with most of our executive officers we cannot assure you however that the restrictions in these agreements prohibiting such executive officers from engaging in competitive activities are enforceable further substantially all of our professional nonexecutive staff and one new executive officer are not covered by agreements that would prohibit them from working for our competitors if any of our key professional personnel leaves our employment and joins one of our competitors our business could be adversely affected 

  

our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate earnings in india 

effective january 1 2002 pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 23 “accounting for income taxesspecial areas” we no longer accrue incremental us taxes on all indian earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur in the future that could effectively force us to change our intent on repatriating indian earnings if we change our intent and repatriate such earnings we will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than our effective income rate in 2006 these increased taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a significant portion of our projects are on a fixedprice basis subjecting us to the risks associated with cost overruns and operating cost inflation 

we contract to provide services either on a timeandmaterials basis or on a fixedprice basis with fixedprice contracts accounting for approximately 25 of our revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2006 and approximately 25 of our revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 we expect that an increasing number of our future projects will be contracted on a fixedprice basis we bear the risk of cost overruns and operating cost inflation in connection with projects covered by fixedprice contracts our failure to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a fixedprice project or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within the time frame committed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we do not continue to improve our operational financial and other internal controls and systems to manage our rapid growth our business may suffer and the value of our shareholders’ investment may be harmed 

our anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources our growth will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls both in the united states india and elsewhere in particular our continued growth will increase the challenges involved in 

 

  

  

  

  

 as part of our growth strategy we are expanding our operations in europe asia and latin america we may not be able to compete effectively in these markets and the cost of entering these markets may be substantially greater than we expect if we fail to compete effectively in the new markets we enter or if the cost of entering those markets is substantially greater than we expect our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we cannot compete effectively we may be required to reconsider our strategy to invest in our international expansion plans and change our intent on the repatriation of our earnings 

we rely on a few customers for a large portion of our revenues 

our top five customers generated approximately 29 of our revenues in the fiscal year ended december 31 2006 approximately 34 of our revenues in the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 and approximately 38 of our revenues in the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a major customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year the loss of one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we generally do not have longterm contracts with our customers and our results of operations could be adversely affected if our clients terminate their contracts with us on short notice 

consistent with industry practice we generally do not enter into longterm contracts with our customers a majority of our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice as a result we are substantially exposed to volatility in the market for our services and may not be able to maintain our level of profitability 

when contracts are terminated we lose the anticipated revenues and might not be able to eliminate associated costs in a timely manner consequently our profit margins in subsequent periods could be lower than expected if we are unable to market our services on terms we find acceptable our financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

  

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing rates 

our profit margin and therefore our profitability is dependent on the rates we are able to recover for our services if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our profit margin and our profitability could suffer the rates we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our operating results experience significant quarterly fluctuations 

we historically have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations and expect these fluctuations to continue among the factors causing these variations have been 

 

  

  

  

 in addition our future revenues operating results and margins may fluctuate as a result of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a high percentage of our operating expenses particularly personnel and rent are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter as a result unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects or in employee wage levels and utilization rates may cause significant variations in our operating results in any particular quarter and could result in losses any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations any material reduction in utilization rates for our professional staff or variance in the onsite offshore staffing mix an unanticipated termination of a major project a customer’s decision not to pursue a new project or proceed to succeeding stages of a current project or the completion during a quarter of several major customer projects could require us to pay underutilized employees and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as a result of these factors it is possible that in some future periods our revenues and operating results may be significantly below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such an event the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable utilization rates 

the cost of providing our services including the utilization rate of our professionals affects our profitability if we are not able to maintain an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals our profit margin and our profitability may suffer our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

   

  

  

 liability claims for damages caused by disclosure of confidential information or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business 

many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for the failure although we attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our it development and maintenance services we cannot assure you that any contractual limitations on liability will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages 

in addition we often have access to or are required to collect and store confidential client and customer data if any person including any of our employees penetrates our network security or misappropriates sensitive data we could be subject to significant liability from our clients or from our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data whether through breach of our computer systems systems failure or otherwise could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 

although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may have potential liability arising from the ims health exchange offer in the event that we breach any of our representations in connection with the distribution agreement entered into with ims health 

we entered into a distribution agreement dated january 7 2003 with ims health the distribution agreement that provides among other things that ims health and we will comply with and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with the representations made to and relied upon by mcdermott will  emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding us federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer in addition pursuant to the distribution agreement we agreed to indemnify ims health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach of the representations that we made and were relied upon by mcdermott will  emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer if we breach any of our representations in connection with the distribution agreement the related indemnification liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we may be subject to legacy dun  bradstreet liabilities that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

in 1996 the dun  bradstreet corporation now known as rh donnelly corporation split itself into three separate companies the dun  bradstreet corporation cognizant corporation and acnielsen corporation in connection with the splitup transaction the dun  bradstreet corporation cognizant corporation renamed nielsen media research of which we were once a part and acnielsen corporation now a subsidiary of the dutch company vnu na entered into a distribution agreement in the 1996 distribution agreement each party assumed the liabilities relating to the businesses allocated to it and agreed to indemnify the other parties and their subsidiaries against those liabilities and certain other matters the 1996 distribution agreement also prohibited each party thereto from distributing to our stockholders any business allocated to it unless the distributed business delivered undertakings agreeing to be jointly and severally liable to the other parties under the 1996 distribution agreement for the liabilities of the distributing parent company under the 1996 distribution agreement ims health made such undertaking when it was spun off by nielsen media research in 1998 and accordingly ims health and nielsen media research are jointly and severally liable to rh donnelly and acnielsen for 

  

cognizant corporation obligations under the terms of the 1996 distribution agreement ims health has requested similar undertakings from us as a condition to the distribution of our shares in the exchange offer ims health is obligated to procure similar undertakings from us to nielsen media research and synavant inc with respect to liabilities allocated to ims health in connection with nielsen media research’s spinoff of ims health and ims health’s spinoff of synavant inc in connection with the exchange offer we gave these undertakings and as a result we may be subject to claims in the future in relation to legacy liabilities 

claims have arisen in the past and may arise in the future under the 1996 distribution agreement or the distribution agreements relating to nielsen media research’s spinoff of ims health and ims health’s spinoff of synavant inc in which case we may be jointly and severally liable for any losses suffered by the parties entitled to indemnification ims health has agreed to indemnify us for any and all liabilities that arise out of our undertakings to be jointly and severally liable for these liabilities but if for any reason ims health does not perform on our indemnification obligation these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our business may be adversely affected 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property we presently hold no patents or registered copyrights and rely upon a combination of copyright and trade secret laws nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and various security measures to protect our intellectual property rights existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or solutions might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights india is a member of the berne convention and has agreed to recognize protections on copyrights conferred under the laws of foreign countries including the laws of the united states we believe that laws rules regulations and treaties in effect in the united states and india are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our copyrights however there can be no assurance that these laws will not change and in particular that the laws of india or the united states will not change in ways that may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components libraries and toolsets from india to the united states or from the united states to india there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of any of our intellectual property or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in development of technology products or services which compete with our products and unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products services or proprietary information if we are unable to protect our intellectual property our business may be adversely affected 

our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others 

we cannot be sure that our services and solutions or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties and we could have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients these claims could harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services or solutions in a number of our contracts we have agreed to indemnify our clients for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties in some instances the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client any claims or litigation in this area whether we ultimately win or lose could be timeconsuming and costly injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements we might not be able to enter into these royalty or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms if a claim of infringement were successful against us or our clients an injunction might be ordered against our client or our own services or operations causing further damages we expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our competitors are able to obtain patents for software products and processes any infringement claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we could lose our ability or be unable to secure the right to utilize the intellectual property of others thirdparty suppliers of software hardware or other intellectual assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property or be acquired or used and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our clients if our ability to provide services and solutions to our clients is impaired our operating results could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to integrate acquired companies or technologies successfully and we may be subject to certain liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions that could harm our operating results 

we believe that opportunities exist in the fragmented it services market to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions and joint ventures we believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence especially in the european market enter new technology areas or expand our capacity we cannot 

  

assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices consummate any acquisition or joint venture or successfully integrate any acquired business or joint venture into our operations further acquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key personnel unanticipated events or circumstances and legal liabilities some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we may finance any future acquisitions with cash debt financing the issuance of equity securities or a combination of the foregoing we cannot assure you that we will be able to arrange adequate financing on acceptable terms in addition acquisitions financed with the issuance of our equity securities could be dilutive 

although we conduct due diligence in connection with each of our acquisitions there may be liabilities that we fail to discover or that we inadequately assess in our due diligence efforts in particular to the extent that prior owners of any acquired businesses or properties failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations or failed to fulfill their contractual obligations to customers we as the successor owner may be financially responsible for these violations and failures and may suffer reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected while we generally require the selling party to indemnify us for any and all liabilities associated with such liabilities if for any reason the seller does not perform their indemnification obligation we may be held responsible for such liabilities the discovery of any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions for which we are unable to receive indemnification for could harm our operating results 

system failure or disruptions in telecommunications could disrupt our business and result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

to deliver our services to our customers we must maintain a high speed network of satellite fiber optic and land lines and active voice and data communications 24 hours a day between our main offices in chennai our other it development centers in india and globally and the offices of our customers worldwide although we maintain redundancy facilities and satellite communications links any systems failure or a significant lapse in our ability to transmit voice and data through satellite and telephone communications could result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

provisions in our charter bylaws and stockholders’ rights plan and provisions under delaware law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals 

provisions in our charter and bylaws each as amended our stockholders’ rights plan and delaware general corporate law or dgcl may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover proposals or delaying or preventing changes in our control or management including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices in addition these documents and provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests our board of directors has the authority without further action by the stockholders to fix the rights and preferences and issue shares of preferred stock our charter provides for a classified board of directors which will prevent a change of control of our board of directors at a single meeting of stockholders the prohibition of our stockholders’ ability to act by written consent and to call a special meeting will delay stockholder actions until annual meetings or until a special meeting is called by our chairman or chief executive officer or our board of directors the supermajorityvoting requirement for specified amendments to our charter and bylaws allows a minority of our stockholders to block those amendments the dgcl also contains provisions preventing stockholders from engaging in business combinations with us subject to certain exceptions these provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock 

compliance with new and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements adds uncertainty to our compliance policies and increases our costs of compliance 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to accounting corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 other sec regulations and the nasdaq global select market rules are creating uncertainty for companies like ours these laws regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such corporate governance standards 

in particular our efforts to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors’ audit of that assessment requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources we consistently assess the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting remediate any control deficiencies that may be identified and validate through testing that our controls are functioning as documented while we do not anticipate any material weaknesses the 

  

inability of management and our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy and effectiveness respectively of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure and our efforts to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities in addition the new laws regulations and standards regarding corporate governance may make it more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with their performance of duties as a result we may face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which could harm our business if we fail to comply with new or changed laws regulations or standards of corporate governance our business and reputation may be harmed

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

in 2006 our revenues increased to 14243 million compared to 8858 million in 2005 net income increased to 2328 million or 155 per diluted share including stockbased compensation expense net of tax equal to 016 per diluted share during 2006 this is compared to 1663 million or 113 per diluted share in 2005 which excludes stockbased compensation expense in the fourth quarter of 2005 we completed the repatriation of 600 million of indian earnings pursuant to the american jobs creation act the act of 2004 leading to a onetime tax benefit included in our 2005 results of approximately 124 million or 008 per diluted share excluding this onetime tax benefit net income was 1539 million or 105 per diluted share in 2005 the key drivers of our revenue growth in 2006 were as follows 

 

  

  

  

 during 2006 we saw increasing demand from our customers for a broad range of it solutions particularly high performance web development initiatives and complex systems development engagements testing customer relationship management or crm enterprise resource planning or erp and data warehousing and business intelligence we finished the year with approximately 400 active clients compared to 250 in 2005 and added 20 strategic clients in 2006 bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 87 we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate between 50 million and 400 million or more in annual revenues at maturity our top five and top ten customers accounted for approximately 29 and 39 respectively of our total revenues in 2006 as compared to approximately 34 and 46 respectively for the year ended december 31 2005 as we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline over time 

in europe we continue to experience strong growth during 2006 our revenue from european customers increased by approximately 773 to approximately 1839 million compared to approximately 1037 million in 2005 in 2006 revenue from europe excluding the uk increased by approximately 261 million or approximately 1140 from approximately 229 million in 2005 to approximately 489 million in 2006 europe will continue to be an area of heavy investment for us in 2007 as we see this region as a growth opportunity for the longterm 

our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of and strong demand for offshore it services recent nasscom india’s national association of software and services companies reports state that india’s it services export industry grew by 33 in the twelvemonth period ended march 31 2006 and it and it enabled export services are projected to grow 27 to 30 in the twelvemonth period ending march 31 2007 

in 2006 our operating margin decreased to approximately 182 compared to 201 in 2005 excluding stockbased compensation costs of approximately 299 million operating margin in 2006 was approximately 203 this was slightly above our historic targeted operating margin range excluding stockbased compensation costs of 19 to 20 of total revenues historically we have invested the profitability above the 19 to 20 operating margin level which excludes stockbased compensation back into our business which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth this investment is primarily focused in the areas of i hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise ii training our technical staff in a broader range of it service offerings iii strengthening our business analytic capabilities iv strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services v continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery and vi recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees in addition we maintain a deep bench of resources trained in a broad range of service offerings in order to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects this also has an effect of reducing our operating margins and lowering our utilization levels for 2007 we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our historic targeted operating margin levels back into the business 

we finished the year with total headcount of approximately 38800 an increase of approximately 14500 over the prior year end the increase in the number of our technical personnel and related infrastructure costs to meet the demand for our services are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in 2006 annualized turnover including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 157 for 2006 the majority of our turnover occurs in india as a result 

  

annualized attrition rates onsite at clients are below our global attrition rate in addition attrition is weighted toward the more junior members of our staff we have experienced wage inflation in india which may continue in the future however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as indian wages represent less than 20 of our total operating expenses 

we are continuing with our strategy of moving from leased facilities to owned facilities as a way of reducing overall operating costs in november 2006 we announced the expansion of our existing india real estate development program to include over three million square feet of new space which is inclusive of the 900000 square feet of space that we added to our planned construction program in february 2006 the expanded program includes the expenditure of approximately 200 million through the end of 2008 on land acquisition facilities construction and furnishings to build new fullyowned stateoftheart development centers in regions primarily designated as special economic zones located in chennai pune kolkata hyderabad and coimbatore india 

in september 2006 we acquired aimnet solutions inc aimnet a us based managed infrastructure and professional services firm for initial net cash consideration of approximately 148 million we completed this acquisition to strengthen our it infrastructure management capabilities we will continue to look for acquisitions that will strengthen our presence in a particular geographic area and increase our capabilities in a specific technology or industry 

at december 31 2006 we had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 6482 million an increase of approximately 2242 million compared to december 31 2005 further we had no third party debt and working capital of approximately 7909 million at the end of 2006 accordingly we do not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123r utilizing the modified prospective method sfas no 123r requires the recognition of stockbased compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements for awards of equity instruments to employees and nonemployee directors based on the grantdate fair value of those awards under the modified prospective method the provisions of sfas no 123r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption in addition the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption determined under the original provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “sfas no 123” are recognized in net income in the periods after the date of adoption pretax stockbased compensation costs of 299 million were recorded for the year ended december 31 2006 as of december 31 2006 the total remaining unrecognized stockbased compensation cost related to nonvested stock options expected to vest amounted to approximately 562 million which will be amortized over the weightedaverage remaining requisite service period of 197 years prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r we followed the intrinsic value method to account for our employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations apb no 25 as allowed by sfas no 123 and as amended by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure” accordingly no stockbased employee compensation cost was recognized as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and with respect to the employee stock purchase plan the discount did not exceed fifteen percent in accordance with the modified prospective method of adoption under sfas no 123r prior period financial statements have not been restated to reflect stockbased compensation costs 

sfas no 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under the prior accounting rules this requirement reduces net operating cash flow and increases net financing cash flows in periods after adoption total cash flow remains unchanged from what would have been reported under the prior accounting rules 

critical accounting estimates and risks 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixedbid contracts the allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets assumptions used in valuing stockbased compensation arrangements contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the 

  

circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenues related to our fixedprice contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting under which the total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s cost to date bears to the total estimated cost cost to cost method estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified 

stockbased compensation  effective january 1 2006 we were required to account for stockbased awards in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected term of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock in addition judgment is also required in estimating the income tax benefits related to the stockbased awards and the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from our estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative creditworthiness of each customer historical collections experience and other information including the aging of the receivables if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

income taxes  determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance if any involves judgment as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in the period of resolution adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income as well as newly enacted tax legislation in each of the jurisdictions where we operate can also affect the overall effective income tax rate 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future we would increase or establish the valuation allowance which would decrease income in the period such determination is made in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 

our indian subsidiary cognizant india is an exportoriented company which under the indian income tax act of 1961 is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each software technology park stp with respect to export profits for each stp substantially all of the earnings of cognizant india are attributable to export profits the majority of the company’s stps in india are currently entitled to a 100 exemption from indian income tax under current law these tax holidays will be completely phased out by march of 2009 on march 31 2006 the tax holiday expired for a second stp however the incremental indian taxes due on the operating profits of this stp did not have a significant effect on our 2006 effective income tax rate as the percentage of indian earnings subject to the tax holiday in india increased as a percentage of total indian earnings in 2006 in anticipation of the complete phase out of the tax holidays in march 2009 we expect to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as special economic zones sez development centers operating in sez will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years under current indian tax law export profits after march 31 2009 from our existing stps will be fully taxable at the indian statutory rate currently 3366 in effect at such time 

  

prior to 2002 it was management’s intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from india to the united states accordingly we provided for deferred income taxes on all such undistributed earnings through december 31 2001 during the first quarter of 2002 we made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in india and geographic expansion in europe and asia as a component of this strategy beginning in 2002 we intend to use indian earnings to expand operations outside of the united states instead of repatriating these earnings to the united states accordingly effective january 1 2002 pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 23 we no longer accrue incremental us taxes on indian earnings as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states as of december 31 2006 the amount of unrepatriated indian earnings and total foreign earnings including unrepatriated indian earnings upon which no incremental us taxes have been recorded is approximately 4348 million and 4576 million respectively if such post2002 earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a rate substantially higher than our overall effective income tax rate in 2006 due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation or whether the amount of previously accrued deferred taxes on indian earnings recognized prior to 2002 would require adjustment 

goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant when determining the fair value of our reporting units we utilize various assumptions including projections of future cash flows any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge as of december 31 2006 our goodwill balance was approximately 272 million 

longlived assets  in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we review longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in general we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset if such assets were determined to be impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks  most of our it development centers including a majority of our employees are located in india additionally we operate in various countries in europe and asia as a result we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potential geopolitical and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers we are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the inability of our management and independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline see item 1a “risk factors” for discussion of additional risks that may affect our business operations or financial results 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data expressed for the three years ended december 31 2006

we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management the outcome of such claims and legal actions if decided adversely is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results cash flows or consolidated financial position additionally many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our application design development and maintenance services there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results financial position and cash flows

foreign currency translation 

overall we believe that we are not exposed to significant revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign exchange rates as approximately 86 of our revenues are generated from customers located in the united states however a portion of our costs in india are denominated in local currency and subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which has an impact on our results of operations in addition a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which results in nonoperating foreign exchange gains and losses on an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the indian rupee in our indian subsidiary 

  

effects of inflation 

our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals competition in india the united states and europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation as with other it service providers we must adequately anticipate wage increases particularly on our fixedprice contracts there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the united states and elsewhere we have experienced wage inflation in india however this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as indian wages represent less than 20 of our total operating expenses 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the sec issued sab 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” “sab 108” sab 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement the pronouncement prescribes an approach whereby the effect of all unrecorded identified errors should be considered on all of the financial statements rather than just either the effect on the balance sheet or the income statement we adopted the provisions of sab 108 as of december 31 2006 the adoption of sab 108 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

on july 13 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions fin 48 requires recognition in the financial statements of the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position the provisions are effective for our first quarter 2007 financial statements with the cumulative effect if any of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin 48 on our consolidated financial statements

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are a leading provider of custom it consulting and technology services as well as outsourcing services for global 2000 companies located in north america europe and asia our core competencies include technology strategy consulting complex systems development enterprise software package implementation and maintenance data warehousing  business intelligence application testing application maintenance infrastructure management and verticallyoriented business process outsourcing bpo we tailor our services to specific industries and utilize an integrated onsiteoffshore business model this seamless onsiteoffshore business model combines technical and account management teams located onsite at the customer location and offshore at dedicated development centers located primarily in india 

industry background 

many companies today face intense competitive pressure and rapidly changing market dynamics driven by such factors as changes in government regulations globalization and technology innovation in response to these challenges many companies are focused on improving productivity increasing service levels lowering costs and accelerating delivery times in order to achieve these goals companies are focusing on a number of technologycentric areas such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these approaches and technologies facilitate faster more responsive lowercost business operations however their development integration and ongoing maintenance present major challenges and require a large number of highly skilled professionals trained in many diverse technologies in addition companies also require additional technical resources to maintain enhance and reengineer their core legacy it systems and to address application maintenance projects increasingly companies are relying on custom it solutions providers such as us to provide these services 

  

 1  

in order to respond effectively to a changing and challenging business environment it departments of many companies have focused increasingly on improving returns on it investments lowering costs and accelerating the delivery of new systems and solutions to accomplish these objectives many it departments have shifted all or a portion of their it development integration and maintenance requirements to outside service providers operating with onsiteoffshore business models 

global demand for high quality lower cost it services from outside providers has created a significant opportunity for it service providers that can successfully leverage the benefits of and address the challenges in using an offshore talent pool the effective use of offshore personnel can offer a variety of benefits including lower costs faster delivery of new it solutions and innovations in vertical solutions processes and technologies certain developing countries particularly india have a large talent pool of highly qualified technical professionals that can provide high quality it and bpo services at a lower cost india is a leader in it services and is regarded as having one of the largest and highest quality pools of talent in the world historically it service providers have used offshore labor pools primarily to supplement the internal staffing needs of customers however evolving customer demands have led to the increasing acceptance and use of offshore resources for higher valueadded services these services include application design development testing integration and maintenance as well as technology consulting and infrastructure management india’s services and software exports continue to see significant growth according to nasscom india’s national association of software and services companies and mckinsey  company the itbpo sector in india was a 172 billion industry in 2004 and is projected to grow to 500 billion by 2009 

using a globally distributed workforce to provide valueadded services presents a number of challenges to it service providers the offshore implementation of valueadded it services requires that it service providers continually and effectively attract train and retain highly skilled software development professionals with the advanced technical skills necessary to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences these skills are necessary to design develop and deploy highquality technology solutions in a costeffective and timely manner in addition it service providers must have the methodologies processes and communications capabilities to enable offshore workforces to be successfully integrated with onsite personnel service providers must also have strong research and development capabilities technology competency centers and relationship management skills in order to compete effectively 

the cognizant approach 

our business is organized and managed primarily around our four verticallyoriented business segments 

 

  

  

  

   

 2  

this vertical focus has been central to our revenue growth and highcustomer satisfaction as the it services industry continues to mature clients are looking for service providers who understand their businesses industry initiatives culture and have solutions tailored to meet their individual business needs we have continued to hire experts out of industry establish a broad base of business analysts invest in industry training for our staff and build out industryspecific services and solutions this approach is central to our highlevels of ontime delivery and customer satisfaction as we understand the full context of our clients’ challenges and have deep experience in addressing them 

our key service areas—it consulting and technology services and outsourcing services—are delivered in a standardized highquality manner through a global delivery model to our clients across our four business segments these service areas include

business segments

our solution and services 

we believe that we have developed an effective integrated onsiteoffshore business model and that this business model will be a critical element of our continued growth to support this business model at december 31 2005 we employed over 24000 it professionals and support staff globally we have also established facilities technology and communications infrastructure in order to support our business model 

across each of our business segments we provide a broad and expanding range of consulting information technology and business processing outsourcing services including 

it consulting and technology services 

 

  

  

  

 in both of these approaches our onsite team members work closely and collaboratively with our clients detailed design implementation and testing are generally performed offshore at our 27 it development centers located in india and china as well as our development centers in chicago phoenix amsterdam and toronto in addition we maintain an onsite presence at each customer location in order to address evolving customer needs and resulting changes to the project 

a key part of our application development and integration offering is a suite of services to help organizations build and integrate business applications with the rest of their operations in this suite of services we leverage our skills in business application development and enterprise application integration to build sophisticated business applications and to integrate these new applications and web sites with client server and legacy systems we build and 

  

 7  

deploy robust scalable and extensible architectures for use in a wide range of industries we maintain competency centers specializing in microsoft ibm sap and java among others in order to be able to provide application development and integration services to a broad spectrum of customers 

our reengineering service offerings assist customers migrating from systems based on legacy computing environments to newer open systemsbased platforms and clientserver architectures often in response to the more stringent demands of business our reengineering tools automate many of the processes required to implement advanced clientserver technologies we believe that this automation substantially reduces the time and cost to perform reengineering services savings that benefit both us and our customers these tools also enable us to perform source code analysis and to redesign target databases and convert certain programming languages if necessary our programmers also help customers redesign and convert user interfaces 

 

 outsourcing 

 

 we provide services to help ensure that a customer’s core operational systems are free of defects and responsive to the customer’s changing needs as part of this process we are often able to introduce product and process enhancements and improve service levels to customers requesting modifications and ongoing support 

our onsiteoffshore business model enables us to provide a range of rapid response and costeffective support services to our customers our onsite team members often provide helpdesk services at the customer’s facility these team members typically carry pagers in the event of an emergency service request and are available to quickly resolve customer problems from remote locations in the case of more complex maintenance services including modifications enhancements and documentation which typically have longer turnaround times we take full advantage of our offshore resources to develop solutions more costeffectively than would be possible relying on higher cost local professionals the services provided by our offshore team members are delivered to customers using satellite and fiberoptic telecommunications 

  

 8  

as part of our application maintenance services we assist customers in renovating their core systems to meet the requirements imposed by new regulations new standards or other external events these services include or have previously included year 2000 compliance eurocurrency compliance decimalization within the securities industry and compliance with the health insurance portability and accountability act for the healthcare industry 

application maintenance service contracts are usually long term in nature and at times can include an element of application development 

we seek to anticipate the operational environment of customer’s it systems as we design and develop such systems we also offer diagnostic services to customers to assist them in identifying shortcomings in their it systems and optimizing the performance of their systems 

 

  

 in addition to our industryspecific expertise and focus our strengths which we believe differentiate us from other it service providers include the following 

established and scalable proprietary processes we have developed proprietary methodologies for integrating onsite and offshore teams to facilitate costeffective ontime delivery of highquality projects these methodologies comprise our proprietary qview software engineering process which is available to all onsite and offshore programmers we use this iso 90012000 certified process to define and implement projects from the design development and deployment stages through ongoing application maintenance for most projects qview is used as part of an initial setting up of processes that allows us to define the scope and risks of the project and subdivide the project into smaller phases with frequent deliverables and feedback from customers we also use our qview process to detect mitigate and correct possible quality defects and to establish appropriate contingencies for each project in order to ensure implementation of the quality process we assign a quality facilitator to each project who reports to a centralized quality assurance and software engineering group this 

  

 9  

group performs on a sample basis quality audits deliverables verifications metrics collection and analysis which are used to improve processes and methodologies these processes and methodologies have proven to be scalable as we have significantly increased the number of offshore development centers customers and projects in addition all of our principal development centers have been assessed by kpmg at level 5 the highest possible rating of both the capability maturity model and the capability maturity model integration of the software engineering institute at carnegie mellon university which are widely recognized means of measuring the quality and maturity of an organization’s software development and maintenance processes in addition all of our principal development centers have been certified by the stqc directorate ministry of communications and information technology government of india the accreditation authority for companies in india under the internationally recognized bs 7799 part 22002 information security standards a comprehensive set of controls comprising best practices in information security and business continuity planning our quality management system has also been certified by kpmg to international standard iso 90012000 of the international organization for standardization an internationally recognized standard for quality management systems directed to the achievement of business results including satisfaction of customers and others

research and development and competency centers  we have project experience and expertise across multiple architectures and technologies and have made significant investments in our competency centers and in research and development to keep abreast of the latest technology developments most of our programmers are trained in multiple technologies and architectures as a result we are able to react to customers’ needs quickly and efficiently redeploy programmers to different technologies in order to develop and maintain this flexibility we have made a substantial investment in our competency centers where the experience gained from particular projects and research and development efforts is leveraged across our entire organization in addition through our investment in research and development activities and the continuing education of our technical personnel we enlarge our knowledge base and develop the necessary skills to keep pace with emerging technologies we believe that our ability to work in new technologies allows us to foster longterm relationships by having the capacity to continually address the needs of both existing and new customers 

  

 10  

welldeveloped infrastructure our extensive facilities technology and communications infrastructure facilitate the seamless integration of our onsite and offshore workforces this is accomplished by permitting team members in different locations to access common project information and to work directly on customer projects this infrastructure allows for 

 

  

  

  

 international time differences enable our offshore teams located in india to access a customer’s computing facilities located in north america europe and asia  pacific during offpeak hours this ability to perform services during offpeak hours enables us to complete projects more rapidly and does not require our customers to invest in duplicative hardware and software in addition for large projects with short time frames our offshore facilities allow for parallel processing of various development phases to accelerate delivery time in addition we can deliver services more rapidly than some competitors without an offshore labor pool because our lower labor costs enable us to costeffectively assign more professionals to a project 

business strategies 

our objectives are to maximize stockholder value and enhance our position as a leading provider of custom it services we implement the following core strategies to achieve these objectives 

further develop longterm customer relationships we have strong longterm strategic relationships with our customers and business partners we seek to establish longterm relationships that present recurring revenue opportunities frequently trying to establish relationships with our customers’ chief information officers or other it decision makers by offering a wide array of costeffective high quality services approximately 91 of our revenues in the year ended december 31 2005 were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2004 we also seek to leverage our experience with a customer’s it systems into new business opportunities knowledge of a customer’s processes and it systems gained during the performance of application maintenance services for example may provide us with a competitive advantage in securing additional development and maintenance projects from that customer 

expand service offerings and solutions we have several teams dedicated to developing new high value services these teams collaborate with customers to develop these services for example we are currently developing new offerings in business consulting and it consulting verticallyoriented business process outsourcing and verticallyoriented it solutions atop innovative technologies including rfid service oriented architectures soa and open source in addition we invest in internal research and development and promote knowledge building and sharing across the organization in order to promote the development of new 

  

 11  

services and solutions that we can offer to our customers furthermore we continue to enhance our capabilities and service offerings in the areas of

 item 1a risk factors 

additional factors that may affect future results 

if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline  

a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india and we are subject to regulatory economic and political uncertainties in india 

we intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in india where as of december 31 2005 a majority of our technical professionals were located while wage costs are lower in india than in the united states and other developed countries for comparably skilled professionals wages in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states which could result in our incurring increased costs for technical professionals and reduced operating margins in addition there is intense competition in india for skilled technical professionals and we expect that competition to increase 

india has also experienced civil unrest and terrorism and has been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries in recent years there have been military confrontations between india and pakistan that have occurred in the region of kashmir and along the indianpakistan border the potential for hostilities between the two countries has been high in light of tensions related to recent terrorist incidents in india and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment including events in and related to afghanistan and iraq if india were to become engaged in armed hostilities particularly if these hostilities were protracted or involved the threat of or use of weapons of mass destruction our operations would be materially adversely affected in addition united states companies may decline to contract with us for services in light of international terrorist incidents or armed hostilities even where india is not involved because of more generalized concerns about relying on a service provider utilizing international resources 

in the past the indian economy has experienced many of the problems confronting the economies of developing countries including high inflation erratic gross domestic product growth and shortages of foreign exchange the indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy and indian government actions concerning the economy could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities including us in the past the indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy including the software development services industry programs that have benefited us include among others tax holidays liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation notwithstanding these benefits india’s central and state governments remain significantly involved in the indian economy as regulators the elimination of any of the benefits realized by us from our indian operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

 20  

we are investing substantial cash assets in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately 

as of december 31 2005 we had contractual commitments of approximately 215 million related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our development centers we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions may increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability will be reduced 

our international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties 

revenues from customers outside north america represented approximately 13 of our revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 13 of our revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 and 12 of our revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2003 we anticipate that revenues from customers outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence particularly in europe in addition a majority of our employees and almost all of our it development centers are located in india as a result we may be subject to risks associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions from time to time we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate our risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in addition we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations generally we may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture our international expansion plans may not be successful and we may not be able to compete effectively in other countries there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we face intense competition from other it service providers 

the intensely competitive it professional services market includes a large number of participants and is subject to rapid change this market includes participants from a variety of market segments including 

 

  

  

   

 21  

  

  

 the market also includes numerous smaller local competitors in the various geographic markets in which we operate our direct competitors who use the onsiteoffshore business model include among others infosys technologies tata consultancy services and wipro in addition many of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do some of these larger competitors such as accenture electronic data systems and ibm global services have offshore operations we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our current levels of profitability or growth as competitive pressures including competition for skilled it development professionals and pricing pressure from competitors employing an onsiteoffshore business model increase 

our business will suffer if we fail to develop new services and enhance our existing services in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological environment 

the it services market is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions our future success will depend on our ability to develop solutions that keep pace with changes in the it services market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing new services addressing evolving technologies on a timely or costeffective basis or if these services are developed that we will be successful in the marketplace in addition there can be no assurance that products services or technologies developed by others will not render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to remain competitive will also depend on our ability to design and implement in a timely and costeffective manner solutions for customers moving from the mainframe environment to clientserver or other advanced architectures our failure to design and implement solutions in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may face difficulties in providing endtoend business solutions for our clients that could cause clients to discontinue their work with us which in turn could harm our business 

we have been expanding the nature and scope of our engagements and have added new service offerings such as it consulting business process outsourcing systems integration and outsourcing of entire portions of it infrastructure the success of these service offerings is dependent in part upon continued demand for such services by our existing and new clients and our ability to meet this demand in a costcompetitive and effective manner in addition our ability to effectively offer a wider breadth of endtoend business solutions depends on our ability to attract existing or new clients to these service offerings to obtain engagements for such endtoend solutions we also are more likely to compete with large wellestablished 

  

 22  

international consulting firms resulting in increased competition and marketing costs accordingly we cannot be certain that our new service offerings will effectively meet client needs or that we will be able to attract existing and new clients to these service offerings 

the increased breadth of our service offerings may result in larger and more complex projects with our clients this will require us to establish closer relationships with our clients and a thorough understanding of their operations our ability to establish such relationships will depend on a number of factors including the proficiency of our it professionals and our management personnel our failure to understand our client requirements or our failure to deliver services which meet the requirements specified by our clients could result in termination of client contracts and we could be liable to our clients for significant penalties or damages 

larger projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements these terminations cancellations or delays may result from the business or financial condition of our clients or the economy generally as opposed to factors related to the quality of our services such cancellations or delays make it difficult to plan for project resource requirements and inaccuracies in such resource planning may have a negative impact on our profitability 

competition for highly skilled technical personnel is intense and the success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled professionals 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highly skilled it development professionals in particular we need to attract train and retain project managers it engineers and other senior technical personnel we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for it development professionals in the united states and india with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer we have subcontracted to a limited extent in the past and may do so in the future with other service providers in order to meet our obligations to our customers our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend in large part on our ability to attract train and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences further we must train and manage our growing work force requiring an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel there can be no assurance that the management skills and systems currently in place will be adequate or that we will be able to train and assimilate new employees successfully our failure to attract train and retain current or future employees could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our growth may be hindered by immigration restrictions 

our future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills from developing countries especially india the vast majority of our it professionals in the united states and in europe are indian nationals the ability of indian nationals to work in the united states depends on their ability and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits 

  

 23  

the h1 b visa classification enables united states employers to hire qualified foreign workers in positions which require an education at least equal to a baccalaureate degree in the united states in specialty occupations such as it systems engineering and systems analysis the h1 b visa usually permits an individual to work and live in the united states for a period of up to six years there is a limit on the number of new h1 b petitions that united states citizenship and immigration services “cis” one of the successor agencies to the immigration and naturalization service may approve in any federal fiscal year and in years in which this limit is reached we may be unable to obtain h1 b visas necessary to bring foreign employees to the united states in the current federal fiscal year the limit is 65000 this cap has been reached as of october 1 2005 new h1 b petitions may not be filed until april 1 2006 and these petitions must be for positions beginning no earlier than october 1 2006 however as a part of our advanced planning process we believe that we have sufficient employees visaready to meet our anticipated business growth in the current year in addition there are strict labor regulations associated with the h1 b visa classification higher users of the h1 b visa program are often subject to investigations by the wage and hour division of the united states department of labor a finding by the united states department of labor of willful or substantial failure by us to comply with existing regulations on the h1 b classification may result in a bar on future use of the h1 b program 

we also regularly transfer employees of our subsidiary in india to the united states to work on projects and at client sites using the l1 visa classification the l1 visa allows companies abroad to transfer certain managers executives and employees with specialized company knowledge to related united states companies such as a parent subsidiary affiliate joint venture or branch office we have an approved “blanket l program” under which the corporate relationships of our transferring and receiving entities have been preapproved by the cis thus enabling individual l1 applications to be presented directly to a united states consular post abroad rather than undergoing the preapproval process in the united states in recent years both the united states consular posts that review initial l1 applications and the cis offices which adjudicate extensions of l1 status have become more restrictive with respect to this category as a result the rate of refusals of initial l1 applications and of extension denials has increased in addition even where l1 visas are ultimately granted and issued security measures undertaken by united states consular posts around the world have caused major delays in visa issuances our inability to bring qualified technical personnel into the united states to staff onsite customer locations would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

on december 8 2004 president bush signed the fy 2005 omnibus appropriations act this legislation contained several important changes to the laws governing l1 visa holders all of the changes took effect on june 8 2005 under one provision of the new law all l1 applicants including those brought to the united states under a blanket program must have worked abroad with the related company for one full year in the prior three years the provision allowing blanket l applicants who had worked abroad for the related company for six months during the qualifying threeyear period has been revoked in addition l1b holders intracompany transferees with specialized company knowledge may not be primarily stationed at the work site of another employer if the l1b holder will be controlled and supervised by an employer other than the petitioning employer finally l1b status may not be granted where placement of the l1b visa holder at a third party site is part of an arrangement to provide labor for the third party rather than placement at the site in connection with the provision of a product or service involving specialized knowledge specific to the petitioning employer 

  

 24  

we do not place l1b workers at third party sites where they are under the supervision of a different employer nor do we place l1b holders at third party sites in an arrangement to provide labor for the third party without providing a service involving our specialized knowledge since implementation of the new law we have not encountered any difficulty in establishing this fact to the satisfaction of citizenship and immigration services however the united states department of state is still in the process of implementing this provision at united states consular posts abroad if these posts decide to interpret these provisions in a very restrictive fashion this could impair our ability to staff our projects in the united states with resources from our entities abroad in addition citizenship and immigration services has not yet issued regulations governing these new provisions if such regulations are restrictive in nature this could impair our ability to staff our projects in the united states with resources from our entities abroad 

we also process immigrant visas for lawful permanent residence for employees to fill positions for which there are no able willing and qualified united states workers available to fill the positions compliance with existing united states immigration and labor laws or changes in those laws making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting our ability to successfully obtain permanent residence for our foreign employees in the united states could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the united states any of these restrictions or limitations on our hiring practices could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to immigration restrictions in the united states there are certain restrictions on transferring our employees to work in the united kingdom where we have experienced significant growth the united kingdom requires that employees who are not nationals of the european economic area eea which includes nationals of all european union countries plus iceland norway liechtenstein and switzerland to obtain an intracompany transfer work permit before beginning to perform work under the work permit regulations in order for us to transfer our noneea employees to the united kingdom we must demonstrate that the employee had been employed by us for at least six months prior to the transfer and that the position in the united kingdom requires someone with either 1 a united kingdom degree level qualification or 2 a higher national diploma hnd level occupational qualification which entitles a person to do a specific job or 3 a general hnd level qualification plus one year’s work experience doing the type of job for which the work permit is sought or 4 at least three years’ highlevel specialist skills acquired through doing the type of job for which the work permit is sought these restrictions restrain our ability to add the skilled professionals we need for our operations in europe and could have an adverse affect on our international strategy to expand our presence in europe as a result the changes to work permit legislation in the united kingdom could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the united states the united kingdom and other countries are subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as 

  

 25  

changes in the application of standards and enforcement immigration and work permit laws and regulation can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity our international expansion strategy and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with it professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our customers 

the issue of outsourcing of services abroad by american companies is a topic of political discussion in the united states measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by united states companies are under discussion in congress and in numerous state legislatures while no substantive antioutsourcing legislation has been introduced to date given the ongoing debate over this issue the introduction of such legislation is possible if introduced such measures are likely to fall within two categories 1 a broadening of restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly andor 2 measures that impact private industry such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions in the event that any of these measures become law our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and our ability to service our customers could be impaired 

an economic slowdown hostilities involving the united states and other acts of terrorism violence or war could delay or reduce the number of new purchase orders we receive and impair our ability to service our customers thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

approximately 87 of our revenue during the year ended december 31 2005 was derived from customers located in the united states in the event of an economic slowdown our customers may delay or reduce their it spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and could have a material adverse affect on our financial results further hostilities involving the united states and other acts of terrorism violence or war such as the attacks of september 11 2001 in the united states the attacks of july 7 2005 in the united kingdom and the continuing conflict in iraq could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to service our customers hostilities involving the united states could cause customers in the united states to delay their decisions on it spending which could affect our financial results in addition acts of terrorism violence or war could give rise to military or travel disruptions and restrictions affecting our employees as of december 31 2005 a majority of our technical professionals were located in india and the vast majority of our technical professionals in the united states and europe are indian nationals who are able to work in the united states and europe only because they hold current visas and work permits travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the united states and europe 

  

 26  

although we continue to believe that we have a strong competitive position in the united states we continue to increase our efforts to geographically diversify our clients and revenue despite our efforts to diversify an economic slowdown hostilities involving the united states and other acts of terrorism violence or war may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

our ability to operate and compete effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel 

our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of the key members of our management team as well as marketing sales and technical personnel and our ability to attract and retain new management and other personnel we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or significant employees competition for personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting and retaining new personnel in the future the loss of any one or more of our key personnel or the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

restrictions in noncompetition agreements with our executive officers may not be enforceable 

we have entered into noncompetition agreements with all of our executive officers we cannot assure you however that the restrictions in these agreements prohibiting the executive officers from engaging in competitive activities are enforceable further substantially all of our professional nonexecutive staff are not covered by agreements that would prohibit them from working for our competitors if any of our key professional personnel leaves our employment and joins one of our competitors our business could be adversely affected 

our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate earnings in india 

effective january 1 2002 pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 23 “accounting for income taxesspecial areas” we no longer accrue incremental united states taxes on all indian earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur in the future that could effectively force us to change our intent on repatriating indian earnings if we change our intent and repatriate such earnings we will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than the effective rate in 2005 these increased taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a significant portion of our projects are on a fixedprice basis subjecting us to the risks associated with cost overruns and operating cost inflation 

we contract to provide services either on a timeandmaterials basis or on a fixedprice basis with fixedprice contracts accounting for approximately 25 of our revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 and approximately 24 of our revenues for the fiscal year ended 

  

 27  

december 31 2004 we expect that an increasing number of our future projects will be contracted on a fixedprice basis we bear the risk of cost overruns and operating cost inflation in connection with projects covered by fixedprice contracts our failure to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a fixedprice project or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within the time frame committed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we do not continue to improve our operational financial and other internal controls and systems to manage our rapid growth our business may suffer and the value of our shareholders’ investment may be harmed 

our anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources our growth will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls both in the united states india and elsewhere in particular our continued growth will increase the challenges involved in 

 

  

  

  

  

 as part of our growth strategy we are expanding our operations in europe and asia we may not be able to compete effectively in these markets and the cost of entering these markets may be substantially greater than we expect if we fail to compete effectively in the new markets we enter or if the cost of entering those markets is substantially greater than we expect our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we cannot compete effectively we may be required to reconsider our strategy to invest in our international expansion plans and change our intent on the repatriation of our earnings 

we rely on a few customers for a large portion of our revenues 

our top five customers generated approximately 34 of our revenues in the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 approximately 38 of our revenues in the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 and approximately 36 of our revenues in the fiscal year ended december 31 2003 the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a major customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year the loss of one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

 28  

we generally do not have longterm contracts with our customers 

consistent with industry practice we generally do not enter into longterm contracts with our customers as a result we are substantially exposed to volatility in the market for our services and may not be able to maintain our level of profitability if we are unable to market our services on terms we find acceptable our financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

our operating results experience significant quarterly fluctuations 

we historically have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations and expect these fluctuations to continue among the factors causing these variations have been 

 

  

  

  

 in addition our future revenues operating results and margins may fluctuate as a result of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a high percentage of our operating expenses particularly personnel and rent are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter as a result unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects or in employee wage levels and utilization rates may cause significant variations in our operating results in any particular quarter and could result in losses any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations any material reduction in utilization rates for our professional staff or variance in the onsite offshore staffing mix an unanticipated termination of a major project a customer’s decision not to pursue a new project or proceed to succeeding stages of a current project or the completion during a quarter of several major customer projects could require us to pay underutilized employees and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

 29  

as a result of these factors it is possible that in some future periods our revenues and operating results may be significantly below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such an event the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 

we may not be able to sustain our current level of profitability 

as of december 31 2005 we had a gross margin of 458 and operating margin of 201 compared to a gross margin of 455 and operating margins of 200 as of december 31 2004 these margins may decline if we experience declines in demand and pricing for our services in addition wages in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states which could result in us incurring increased costs for technical professionals although we have been able to partially offset wage increases and foreign currency fluctuations through further leveraging of our lowcost operating structure and obtaining price increases there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 

liability claims for damages caused by disclosure of confidential information or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business 

many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for the failure although we attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our it development and maintenance services there can be no assurance that any contractual limitations on liability will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages 

in addition we often have access to or are required to collect and store confidential client and customer data if any person including any of our employees penetrates our network security or misappropriates sensitive data we could be subject to significant liability from our clients or from our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data whether through breach of our computer systems systems failure or otherwise could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 

although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

 30  

we may have potential liability arising from the ims health exchange offer in the event that we breach any of our representations in connection with the distribution agreement entered into with ims health 

we entered into a distribution agreement dated january 7 2003 with ims health the “distribution agreement” that provides among other things that ims health and we will comply with and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with the representations made to and relied upon by mcdermott will  emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding united states federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer in addition pursuant to the distribution agreement we agreed to indemnify ims health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach of the representations that we made and were relied upon by mcdermott will  emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the united states federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer if we breach any of our representations in connection with the distribution agreement the related indemnification liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we may be subject to legacy dun  bradstreet liabilities that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

in 1996 the dun  bradstreet corporation now known as rh donnelly corporation split itself into three separate companies the dun  bradstreet corporation cognizant corporation and acnielsen corporation in connection with the splitup transaction the dun  bradstreet corporation cognizant corporation renamed nielsen media research of which we were once a part and acnielsen corporation now a subsidiary of the dutch company vnu na entered into a distribution agreement in the 1996 distribution agreement each party assumed the liabilities relating to the businesses allocated to it and agreed to indemnify the other parties and their subsidiaries against those liabilities and certain other matters the 1996 distribution agreement also prohibited each party thereto from distributing to our stockholders any business allocated to it unless the distributed business delivered undertakings agreeing to be jointly and severally liable to the other parties under the 1996 distribution agreement for the liabilities of the distributing parent company under the 1996 distribution agreement ims health made such undertaking when it was spun off by nielsen media research in 1998 and accordingly ims health and nielsen media research are jointly and severally liable to rh donnelly and acnielsen for cognizant corporation obligations under the terms of the 1996 distribution agreement ims health has requested similar undertakings from us as a condition to the distribution of our shares in the exchange offer ims health is obligated to procure similar undertakings from us to nielsen media research and synavant inc with respect to liabilities allocated to ims health in connection with nielsen media research’s spinoff of ims health and ims health’s spinoff of synavant inc in connection with the exchange offer we gave these undertakings and as a result we may be subject to claims in the future in relation to legacy liabilities 

one possible legacy liability arises from a pending antitrust action filed by information resources inc in 1996 which names as joint defendants all parties to the 1996 distribution agreement information resources’ complaint alleges damages in excess of 3500 million 

  

 31  

which amount it has asked to be trebled plus punitive damages acnielsen corporation agreed in connection with the 1996 distribution agreement to assume any and all liabilities resulting from the information resources claim to the extent that acnielsen remains financially viable in connection with vnu’s acquisition of acnielsen in 2001 vnu was required to assume this liability and to be included with acnielsen for purposes of determining the amount that can be paid by acnielsen in respect of any claim ims health and nielsen media research inc successors to cognizant corporation have agreed to share liabilities in excess of the amount acnielsen is required to pay under the 1996 distribution agreement in respect of this claim on a 5050 basis with the dun  bradstreet corporation subsequently separated into the dun  bradstreet corporation and moody’s corporation ims health and nielsen media research inc further agreed to share their portion of the liabilities in relation to the information resources action on a 7525 basis subject to nielsen media research inc’s liability in respect of the information resources action and certain other contingent liabilities being capped at 1250 million based on our undertaking we could be held liable for those amounts that vnu ims health nielsen media research inc and the dun  bradstreet corporation and their successors are unable or unwilling to pay 

other claims have arisen in the past and may arise in the future under the 1996 distribution agreement or the distribution agreements relating to nielsen media research’s spinoff of ims health and ims health’s spinoff of synavant inc in which case we may be jointly and severally liable for any losses suffered by the parties entitled to indemnification 

ims health has agreed to indemnify us for any and all liabilities that arise out of our undertakings to be jointly and severally liable for these liabilities but if for any reason ims health does not perform on our indemnification obligation these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others our business may be adversely affected 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights we presently hold no patents or registered copyrights and rely upon a combination of copyright and trade secret laws nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and various security measures to protect our intellectual property rights india is a member of the berne convention and has agreed to recognize protections on copyrights conferred under the laws of foreign countries including the laws of the united states we believe that laws rules regulations and treaties in effect in the united states and india are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our copyrights however there can be no assurance that these laws will not change and in particular that the laws of india or the united states will not change in ways that may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components libraries and toolsets from india to the united states or from the united states to india there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of any of our intellectual property or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in development of technology products or services which compete with our products and unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products services or proprietary information

although we believe that our intellectual property rights do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of any of our competitors or others there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted against us in the future that assertion of infringement claims will not result in litigation or that we would prevail in that litigation or be able to obtain a license for the use of any infringed intellectual property from a third party on commercially reasonable terms if at all we expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our competitors are able to obtain patents for software products and processes any infringement claims regardless of their outcome could result in substantial cost to us and divert management’s attention from our operations any infringement claim or litigation against us could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unable to integrate acquired companies or technologies successfully and we may be subject to certain liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions that could harm our operating results 

we believe that opportunities exist in the fragmented it services market to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions and joint ventures we believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence especially in the european market enter new technology areas or expand our capacity we cannot assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices consummate any acquisition or joint venture or successfully integrate any acquired business or joint venture into our operations further acquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key personnel unanticipated events or circumstances and legal liabilities some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we may finance any future acquisitions with cash debt financing the issuance of equity securities or a combination of the foregoing we cannot assure you that we will be able to arrange adequate financing on acceptable terms in addition acquisitions financed with the issuance of our equity securities could be dilutive 

although we conduct due diligence in connection with each of our acquisitions there may be liabilities that we fail to discover or that we inadequately assess in our due diligence efforts in particular to the extent that prior owners of any acquired businesses or properties failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations or failed to fulfill their contractual obligations to customers we as the successor owner may be financially responsible for these violations and failures and may suffer reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected while we generally require the selling party to indemnify us for any and all liabilities associated with such liabilities if for any reason the seller does not perform their indemnification obligation we may be held responsible for such liabilities the discovery of any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions for which we are unable to perceive for indemnification could harm our operating results

system failure or disruptions in telecommunications could disrupt our business and result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

to deliver our services to our customers we must maintain a high speed network of satellite fiber optic and land lines and an active voice and data communications 24 hours a day between our main offices in chennai our other it development centers in india and globally and the offices of our customers worldwide although we maintain redundancy facilities and satellite communications links any systems failure or a significant lapse in our ability to transmit voice and data through satellite and telephone communications could result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability 

provisions in our charter bylaws and stockholders’ rights plan and provisions under delaware law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals 

provisions in our charter and bylaws each as amended our stockholders’ rights plan and delaware general corporate law “dgcl” may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover proposals or delaying or preventing changes in our control or management including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices in addition these documents and provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests our board of directors has the authority without further action by the stockholders to fix the rights and preferences and issue shares of preferred stock our charter provides for a classified board of directors which will prevent a change of control of our board of directors at a single meeting of stockholders the prohibition of our stockholders’ ability to act by written consent and to call a special meeting will delay stockholder actions until annual meetings or until a special meeting is called by our chairman or chief executive officer or our board of directors the supermajorityvoting requirement for specified amendments to our charter and bylaws allows a minority of our stockholders to block those amendments the dgcl also contains provisions preventing stockholders from engaging in business combinations with us subject to certain exceptions these provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock 

compliance with new and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements adds uncertainty to our compliance policies and increases our costs of compliance 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to accounting corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules are creating uncertainty for companies like ours these new or changed laws regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such corporate governance standards 

in particular our efforts to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over 

  

 34  

financial reporting and our external auditors’ audit of that assessment requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources we consistently assess the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting remediate any control deficiencies that may be identified and validate through testing that our controls are functioning as documented while we do not anticipate any material weaknesses the inability of our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure and our efforts to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities in addition the new laws regulations and standards regarding corporate governance may make it more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance further our board members chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with their performance of duties as a result we may face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers which could harm our business if we fail to comply with new or changed laws regulations or standards of corporate governance our business and reputation may be harmed

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive summary 

in 2005 our revenues increased to 8858 million compared to 5867 million in 2004 net income increased to 1663 million or 113 per diluted share in 2005 compared to 1002 million or 070 per diluted share in 2004 in the fourth quarter of 2005 we completed the repatriation of 600 million of indian earnings pursuant to the american jobs creation act the act of 2004 leading to a onetime tax benefit included in our 2005 results of approximately 124 million or 008 per diluted share excluding this onetime tax benefit net income increased to 1539 million or 105 per diluted share in 2005 the key drivers of our revenue growth in 2005 were as follows 

 

  

  

 during 2005 we saw increasing demand from our customers for a broad range of it solutions particularly high performance web development initiatives complex systems development engagements testing customer relationship management crm enterprise resource planning erp data warehousing and business intelligence we finished the year with approximately 250 active clients compared to 233 in 2004 and added 19 strategic clients in 2005 bring the total number of our strategic clients to 67 we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate between 50 million and 400 million or more in annual revenues at maturity our top five and top ten customers accounted for approximately 34 and 46 respectively of our total revenues in 2005 as compared approximately 38 and 52 respectively for the year ended december 31 2004 as we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline in future periods 

in europe we continue to see growth in the uk market and we are starting to see signs of increased demand in continental europe our revenue from european customers increased by approximately 41 in 2005 to 1037 million compared to 737 million in 2004 in 2005 revenue from continental europe increased by approximately 104 million or approximately 83 from approximately 125 million in 2004 to approximately 229 million in 2005 continental europe will continue to be an area of heavy investment for us in 2006 as we see this area as a growth opportunity for the longterm the balance of our revenue from europe came from customers in the uk 

  

 42  

in 2005 our operating margin increased to approximately 201 compared to 200 in 2004 this was consistent with our historic targeted operating margin range of 19 to 20 of total revenues historically we have invested the profitability above the 19 to 20 operating margin level back into our business which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth this investment is primarily focused in the areas of i hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise ii training our technical staff in a broader range of it service offerings iii strengthening our business analytic capabilities iv strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services and v continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery in addition we maintain a deep bench of resources trained in a broad range of service offerings in order to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects this also has an effect of reducing our operating margins and lowering our utilization levels 

we finished the year with total headcount of approximately 24300 an increase of approximately 9000 over the prior year end the increase in the number of our technical personnel and related infrastructure costs to meet the demand for our services are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in 2005 turnover including both voluntary and involuntary was approximately 14 for 2005 the vast majority of our turnover occurs in india resulting in onsite annualized attrition rates below the global rate in addition attrition is weighted toward the most junior members of our staff 

we are continuing with our strategy of moving from leased facilities to owned facilities as way of reducing overall operating costs we recently expanded our plans to construct additional fullyowned development centers to now include over 17 million square feet as compared to previous plans announced in october 2004 to add 900000 square feet of space the 17 million square feet of facilities will be located in chennai pune kolkata hyderabad and bangalore india the total construction expenditure related to this expanded program is estimated to the approximately 140 million an increase of approximately 64 million when compared to the expansion program announced in october 2004 which we expect to fund primarily from current operations 

in april 2005 we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of fathom solutions llc fathom a united states based company specializing in it consulting in the telecommunications and financial services industries for initial consideration of approximately 233 million in cash and stock additional purchase price not to exceed 160 million payable in 2007 is contingent on fathom achieving certain financial and operating targets over the two years ended april 30 2007 and will be recorded when the contingency is resolved we completed this acquisition primarily to strengthen our service capabilities in the telecommunications industry we will continue to look for acquisitions that will strengthen our presence in a particular geographic area and increase our capabilities in a specific technology or industry 

at december 31 2005 we had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 4240 million an increase of approximately 1092 million compared to december 31 2004 further we had no third party debt and working capital of approximately 5077 million at the end of 2005 accordingly we do not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues 

  

 43  

on january 1 2006 we will adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r which requires the expensing of our stock compensation programs we expect the adoption of sfas 123r to reduce net income in 2006 by an amount slightly above the sfas no 123 pro forma stock compensation expense of approximately 18 million for 2005 factors that will affect our estimate of the sfas 123r expense for 2006 include the timing and geographic mix of 2006 option grants and changes to our stock price volatility of our stock and riskfree interest rates during the year in 2006 

critical accounting estimates and risks 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixedbid contracts the allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual amounts will differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenues related to our fixedprice contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting under which the total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s cost to date bears to the total estimated cost cost to cost method estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified 

allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative creditworthiness of each customer historical collections experience and other information including the aging of the receivables if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

 44  

income taxes  determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance if any involves judgment as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in the period of resolution adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income as well as newly enacted tax legislation in each of the jurisdictions where we operate can also affect the overall effective income tax rate 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or equity if the deferred tax asset is related to tax benefits from stock option benefits that have not been realized in the period such determination was made 

our indian subsidiary cognizant india is an exportoriented company which under the indian income tax act of 1961 is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each software technology park stp with respect to export profits for each stp substantially all of the earnings of cognizant india are attributable to export profits in 2004 the tenyear tax holiday expired for one stp and accordingly the export profits for that stp are subject to indian income tax export profits from the remaining stps in india are currently entitled to a 100 exemption from indian income tax under current law these tax holidays will be completely phased out by march of 2009 the tax holiday did not expire for any stps in 2005 on march 31 2006 the tax holiday will expire for an additional stp however we do not expect the incremental indian taxes due on the operating profits of this stp to have a significant effect on our 2006 effective income tax rate as we anticipate the percentage of indian earnings subject to the tax holiday in india will increase as a percentage of total indian earnings in 2006 in anticipation of the complete phase out of the tax holidays in march 2009 we expect to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as special economic zones sez development centers operating in sez will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years under current indian tax law export profits after march 31 2009 from our existing stps will be fully taxable at the indian statutory rate currently 3366 in effect at such time 

prior to 2002 it was management’s intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from india to the united states accordingly we provided for deferred income taxes on all such undistributed earnings through december 31 2001 during the first quarter of 2002 we made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in india and geographic expansion in europe and asia as a component of this strategy beginning in 2002 we intend to use indian earnings to expand operations outside of the 

  

 45  

us instead of repatriating these earnings to the united states accordingly effective january 1 2002 pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 23 we no longer accrue incremental united states taxes on indian earnings as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us as of december 31 2005 the amount of unrepatriated indian earnings and total foreign earnings including unrepatriated indian earnings upon which no incremental us taxes has been recorded is approximately 267 million and 283 million respectively if such post2002 earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a rate substantially higher than our overall effective income tax rate in 2005 due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation or whether the amount of previously accrued deferred taxes on indian earnings recognized prior to 2002 would require adjustment 

goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant when determining the fair value of our reporting units we utilize various assumptions including projections of future cash flows any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge as of december 31 2005 our goodwill balance was approximately 182 million 

longlived assets  in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we review longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in general we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset if such assets were determined to be impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks  most of our it development centers including a majority of our employees are located in india as a result we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potential geopolitical and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers we are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the inability of our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline see item 1a “risk factors” for discussion of additional risks that may affect our business operations or financial results

revenue  revenue increased by 510 or approximately 2992 million from approximately 5867 million during 2004 to approximately 8858 million in 2005 this increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the onsiteoffshore delivery model our expanding range of service offerings which allowed us to access a larger share of our customers it budgets continued strength in our customers’ discretionary spending increased revenue from existing customers and revenue from new customers added since december 31 2004 including the acquisition of fathom in 2005 approximately 91 of our revenues were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2004 and the number of our active 

  

 47  

customers as of year end increased to approximately 250 as compared to approximately 233 at the end of 2004 in addition we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services our financial services segment accounted for approximately half of our year over year increase in revenue or approximately 1505 million our it consulting and technology services and it outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 59 and 44 respectively compared to 2004 and represented approximately 49 and 51 respectively of total revenues in 2005 no customer accounted for sales in excess of 10 of revenues in 2005 jpmorgan chase accounted for 137 of our revenues in 2004

income from operations  income from operations increased 510 or approximately 600 million from approximately 1176 million during 2004 to approximately 1776 million during 2005 representing essentially unchanged operating margins of approximately 201 of revenues in 2005 and 200 of revenues in 2004 

other incomeexpense net  other incomeexpense net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses the increase in other income is primarily attributed to an increase in interest income from 44 million during 2004 to approximately 90 million during 2005 partially offset by a 13 million yearoveryear reduction in other income due to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency exchange rates the increase in interest income is due primarily to higher invested balances and an increase in shortterm interest rates 

provision for income taxes  the provision for income taxes decreased from approximately 219 million in 2004 to approximately 190 million in 2005 the effective income tax rate decreased from 179 in 2004 to 103 in 2005 the decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2005 is primarily attributed to the onetime benefit of approximately 124 

  

 48  

million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 in connection the repatriation of 600 million of indian earnings under the act the effective income tax rate in 2005 excluding the onetime benefit was 170 which decreased from the prior year primarily due to the overall growth in our business which resulted in a greater percentage of our indian earnings falling under the income tax holiday

year ended december 31 2004 compared to year ended december 31 2003 

revenue  revenue increased by 593 or approximately 2184 million from approximately 3682 million during 2003 to approximately 5867 million in 2004 this increase resulted primarily from increased revenue from existing customers and revenue from new customers added since december 31 2003 including acquisitions specifically our financial services segment accounted for approximately 120 million of the year over year increase demand for our it consulting and technology services increased significantly due to continued strength in our customers’ discretionary spending jpmorgan chase accounted for 137 of our revenues in 2004 and 101 of our revenues in 2003 no other customer accounted for sales in excess of 10 of revenues in 2004 or 2003 

gross profit  our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries payroll taxes benefits immigration relocation and project related travel for technical personnel and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues cost of revenues increased by 601 or approximately 1201 million from approximately 1997 million during 2003 to approximately 3198 million in 2004 the increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals the increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services our gross profit increased by 584 or approximately 984 million from approximately 1685 million during 2003 to approximately 2669 million during 2004 gross profit margin decreased from 458 of revenues during 2003 to 455 of revenues in 2004 the decrease in such gross profit margin was attributable in part to the appreciation of the indian rupee versus the united states dollar 

selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits travel promotion communications management finance administrative and occupancy costs selling general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization increased by 551 or approximately 530 million from approximately 962 million during 2003 to approximately 1492 million during 2004 and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 261 in 2003 to 254 in 2004 the increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that have resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years partially offset by the appreciation of the indian rupee versus the united states dollar 

  

 49  

income from operations  income from operations increased 627 or approximately 453 million from approximately 723 million during 2003 to approximately 1176 million during 2004 representing approximately 196 of revenues during 2003 and 200 of revenues during 2004 the increase in operating margin was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years

net income  net income increased from approximately 574 million in 2003 to approximately 1002 million in 2004 representing approximately 156 and 171 as a percentage of revenues respectively the increase in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior period was primarily due to the absence in 2004 of the onetime nonrecurring splitoff costs referred to above and a lower effective income tax rate for 2004 compared to 2003

defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers certain expenses such as general and administrative and a portion of depreciation and amortization are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as “unallocated” and adjusted only against the total income from operations

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2005 we had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 4240 million we have used and plan to use such cash for i expansion of existing operations including our offshore it development centers ii continued development of new service lines iii possible acquisitions of related businesses iv formation of joint ventures and v general corporate purposes including working capital as of december 31 2005 we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately 5077 million as compared to working capital of approximately 3389 million with no third party debt as of december 31 2004 accordingly we do not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues 

net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 1598 million for the year ended december 31 2005 1273 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and 799 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the increase in 2005 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2005 offset in part by slower collections of receivables and the timing of payment of accrued expenses trade accounts receivable increased from approximately 523 million at december 31 2003 to approximately 964 million at december 31 2004 and to approximately 1540 million at december 31 2005 unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately 95 million at december 31 2003 to approximately 142 million at december 31 2004 and increased to approximately 227 million at december 31 2005 the increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2005 was due primarily to increased revenues and a higher number of days of sales outstanding unbilled receivables increased primarily due to increased revenue and the timing of milestone billings for certain fixed price contracts we monitor turnover aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff at december 31 2005 our days’ sales outstanding including unbilled receivables was approximately 63 days as compared to 59 days as of december 31 2004 and 53 days as of december 31 2003 

our investing activities used net cash of approximately 2045 million for the year ended december 31 2005 1127 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and 306 million for 

  

 54  

the year ended december 31 2003 the increase in each year was primarily related to increased investment of excess cash generated from operations in shortterm investments to achieve a higher return on invested balances and greater investment in property and equipment to expand our offshore it development centers 

our financing activities provided net cash of approximately 475 million for the year ended december 31 2005 368 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and 218 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the increase in each year was primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of stock 

we believe that our available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our longterm capital requirements beyond this 12month period will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock our continued intent not to repatriate earnings subsequent to january 1 2002 from india our ability not to breach the distribution agreement between ims health and us especially as it relates to our tax indemnities and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we cannot be certain that additional financing if required will be available on terms favorable to us if at all 

during july 2004 we entered into a foreign currency forward contract with a sixmonth term and notional amount of 125 million to sell the indian rupee for united states dollars that was settled in january 2005 we entered into this forward contract to manage a portion of our foreign currency risk related to indian rupee denominated asset balances primarily cash investments at our indian subsidiary cognizant india movement in the exchange rate for the indian rupee results in foreign currency gains or losses upon remeasurement of cognizant india’s financial statements into its functional currency the united states dollar our objective was to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of the indian rupee by offsetting a portion of such exposure with gains or losses on the forward contract referred to above the forward contract was marked to market and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported along with foreign currency gains or losses in the caption “other income expense net” on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 

other than the aforementioned forward contract we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources 

commitments and contingencies 

we have expanded our plans to construct additional fullyowned it development centers to now include over 17 million square feet as compared to previous plans announced in october 2004 to add 900000 square feet of space the 17 million square feet of facilities will be located 

  

 55  

in chennai pune kolkata hyderabad and bangalore india as of december 31 2005 we have entered into fixed capital commitments of approximately 704 million related to this india development center expansion program of which approximately 489 million has been spent to date 

as of december 31 2005 we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

   in connection with the acquisition of substantially all the assets of fathom additional purchase price not to exceed 160 million payable in 2007 is contingent on fathom achieving certain financial and operating targets over the two years ended april 30 2007 

contingent purchase price payments relating to acquisitions are recorded when the contingencies are resolved the contingent consideration if paid will be recorded as an additional element of the cost of the acquired company any additional payments relating to the achievement of postacquisition financial and operating targets is expected to be funded by cash flows from operations 

we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management the outcome of such claims and legal actions if decided adversely is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results cash flows or consolidated financial position additionally many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our application design development and maintenance services there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there 

  

 56  

can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results financial position and cash flows 

in connection with our splitoff from ims health we entered into a distribution agreement dated january 7 2003 with ims health referred to as the distribution agreement the distribution agreement provides among other things that ims health and we will comply with and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with the representations made to and relied upon by mcdermott will  emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the united states federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer in addition pursuant to the distribution agreement we indemnified ims health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach in the representations we made to and were relied upon by mcdermott will  emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the united states federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer if we breach any of our representations in connection with the distribution agreement the related indemnification liability could be material to our quarterly and annual operating results financial position and cash flows 

exit activity 

on june 29 2004 we announced our plans to winddown operations at our development center located in limerick ireland and close the facility by march 31 2005 as of march 31 2005 we completed the winddown of our limerick development facility during the year ended december 31 2004 we recorded expenses of approximately 15 million primarily for severance retention bonuses and an obligation to repay funds previously received through local job grant programs and made payments of 10 million through december 31 2004 during the year ended december 31 2005 we recorded additional expenses of approximately 01 million and made payments of approximately 06 million primarily for severance and retention bonuses all costs have been paid as of december 31 2005 

foreign currency translation 

overall we believe that we are not exposed to significant revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign exchange rates as approximately 87 of our revenues are generated from customers located in the united states however a portion of our costs in india are denominated in local currency and subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which has an impact on our results of operations in addition a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which results in nonoperating foreign exchange gains and losses on an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the indian rupee in our indian subsidiary 

  

 57  

related party transactions 

on february 13 2003 the splitoff date ims health distributed all of our class b common stock that ims health owned in an exchange offer to ims health stockholders the splitoff in connection with the exchange offer we incurred splitoff costs of 20 million in 2003 as a result of the splitoff ims health is no longer a related party as of the splitoff date accordingly our revenues from ims health subsequent to the splitoff date are classified as third party revenues we recognized related party revenues from ims health totaling approximately 26 million in 2003 total revenues from ims health during 2003 including related party revenues prior to the splitoff date were approximately 227 million 

effects of inflation 

our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals competition in india the united states and europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation as with other it service providers we must adequately anticipate wage increases particularly on our fixedprice contracts there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the united states and elsewhere 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2005 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” sfas no 154 replaces accounting principles board opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and fasb statement no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” and changes the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle sfas no 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement when specific transition provisions are not provided sfas no 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements for changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific or cumulative effect of the change sfas no 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r which is a revision of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas no 123 sfas no 123r supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb no 25 and amends sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows” generally the approach in sfas no 123r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 123 however sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options and issuances under employee stock purchase plans to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard in addition sfas no 123r requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under current accounting rules this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods 

  

 58  

after adoption total cash flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules sfas no 123r is effective for our annual reporting period beginning january 1 2006 

we will adopt sfas no 123r effective january 1 2006 utilizing the modified prospective method adoption of sfas no 123r will reduce our gross margin operating margin reported net income and earnings per share because we currently use the intrinsic value method as permitted by apb no 25 accordingly no compensation expense is currently recognized for stock purchase rights granted under our i employee stock option plans since the exercise price equals the fair value of the underlying stock at date of grant and ii employee stock purchase plan for the year ended december 31 2006 we expect the annualized aftertax cost associated with expensing grants under our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans including an estimate of grants to be issued in 2006 to be slightly above the sfas no 123 pro forma stock compensation expense of approximately 18 million for 2005 factors that will affect our estimate of the sfas 123r expense for 2006 include the timing and geographic mix of 2006 option grants and changes to our stock price volatility of our stock and riskfree interest rates during the year in 2006

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations during july 2004 we entered into a foreign currency forward contract with a sixmonth term and notional amount of 125 million to sell the indian rupee for united states dollars that was settled in january 2005 we may continue to enter into such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or 

  

 59  

depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies other than the aforementioned forward contract we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources

related to recent terrorist incidents in india and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment including events in and related to afghanistan if india were to become engaged in armed hostilities particularly if these hostilities were protracted or involved the threat of or use of weapons of mass destruction our operations would be materially adversely affected in addition us companies may decline to contract with us for services in light of international terrorist incidents or armed hostilities even where india is not involved because of more generalized concerns about relying on a service provider utilizing international resources in the past the indian economy has experienced many of the problems confronting the economies of developing countries including high inflation erratic gross domestic product growth and shortages of foreign exchange the indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy and indian government actions concerning the economy could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities including us in the past the indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy including the software development services industry programs that have benefited us include among others tax holidays liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation notwithstanding these benefits india’s central and state governments remain significantly involved in the indian economy as regulators the elimination of any of the benefits realized by us from our indian operations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   our international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties revenues from customers outside north america represented 13 12 and 13 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively we anticipate that revenues from customers outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence particularly in europe in addition a majority of our employees and almost all of our it development centers are located in india as a result we may be subject to risks associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions from time to time we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate our risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 17 

we face intense competition from other it service providers the intensely competitive it professional services market includes a large number of participants and is subject to rapid change this market includes participants from a variety of market segments including  the market also includes numerous smaller local competitors in the various geographic markets in which we operate our direct competitors who use the onsiteoffshore business model include among others infosys technologies tata consultancy services and wipro in addition many of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do some of these larger competitors such as accenture electronic data systems and ibm global services have offshore operations we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our current levels of profitability or growth as competitive pressures including competition for skilled it development professionals and pricing pressure from competitors employing an onsiteoffshore business model increase   our business will suffer if we fail to develop new services and enhance our existing services in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological environment the it services market is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions our future success will depend on our ability to develop solutions that keep pace with changes in the it services market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing new services addressing evolving technologies on a timely or costeffective basis or if these services are developed that we will be successful in the marketplace in addition there can be no assurance that products services or technologies developed by others will not render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition our ability to remain competitive will also depend on our ability to design and implement in a timely and costeffective manner solutions for customers moving from the mainframe environment to clientserver or other advanced architectures our failure to design and implement solutions in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 18 

  competition for highly skilled technical personnel is intense and the success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled professionals our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain highly skilled it development professionals in particular we need to attract train and retain project managers it engineers and other senior technical personnel we believe there is a shortage of and significant competition for it development professionals in the united states and india with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer we have subcontracted to a limited extent in the past and may do so in the future with other service providers in order to meet our obligations to our customers our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend in large part on our ability to attract train and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace with continuing changes in information technology evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences further we must train and manage our growing work force requiring an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel there can be no assurance that the management skills and systems currently in place will be adequate or that we will be able to train and assimilate new employees successfully our failure to attract train and retain current or future employees could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition our growth may be hindered by immigration restrictions our future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills from developing countries especially india the vast majority of our it professionals in the united states and in europe are indian nationals the ability of indian nationals to work in the united states depends on their ability and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits the h1 b visa classification enables us employers to hire qualified foreign workers in positions which require an education at least equal to a us baccalaureate degree in specialty occupations such as it systems engineering and systems analysis the h1 b visa usually permits an individual to work and live in the united states for a period of up to six years there is a limit on the number of new h1 b petitions that us citizenship and immigration services “cis” one of the successor agencies to the immigration and naturalization service may approve in any federal fiscal year and in years in which this limit is reached we may be unable to obtain h1 b visas necessary to bring foreign employees to the united states in the current federal fiscal year the limit is 65000 this cap has been reached as of october 1 2004 new h1 b petitions may not be filed until april 1 2005 and these petitions must be for positions beginning no earlier than october 1 2005 however as a part of our advanced planning process we believe that we have sufficient employees visaready to meet our anticipated business growth in the current year in addition there are strict labor regulations associated with the h1 b visa classification higher users of the h1 b visa program are often subject to investigations by the wage and hour division of the us department of labor a finding by the us department of labor of willful or substantial failure by us to comply with existing regulations on the h1 b classification may result in a bar on future use of the h1 b program 19 

we also regularly transfer employees of our subsidiary in india to the united states to work on projects and at client sites using the l1 visa classification the l1 visa allows companies abroad to transfer certain managers executives and employees with specialized company knowledge to related us companies such as a parent subsidiary affiliate joint venture or branch office we have an approved “blanket l program” under which the corporate relationships of our transferring and receiving entities have been preapproved by the cis thus enabling individual l1 applications to be presented directly to a us consular post abroad rather than undergoing the preapproval process in the united states in recent years both the us consular posts that review initial l1 applications and the cis offices which adjudicate extensions of l1 status have become more restrictive with respect to this category as a result the rate of refusals of initial l1 applications and of extension denials has increased in addition even where l1 visas are ultimately granted and issued security measures undertaken by us consular posts around the world have caused major delays in visa issuances our inability to bring qualified technical personnel into the united states to staff onsite customer locations would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition on december 8 2004 president bush signed the fy 2005 omnibus appropriations act this legislation contained several important changes to the laws governing l1 visa holders all of the changes take effect on june 8 2005 under one provision of the new law all l applicants including those brought to the us under a blanket program must have worked abroad with the related company for one full year in the prior three years the provision allowing blanket l applicants who had worked abroad for the related company for six months during the qualifying threeyear period has been revoked in addition l1b holders intracompany transferees with specialized company knowledge may not be primarily stationed at the work site of another employer if the l1b holder will be controlled and supervised by an employer other than the petitioning employer finally l1b status may not be granted where placement of the l1b visa holder at a third party site is part of an arrangement to provide labor for the third party rather than placement at the site in connection with the provision of a product or service involving specialized knowledge specific to the petitioning employer as to the other new provisions of the l1 law cognizant does not place l1b workers at third party sites where they are under the supervision of a different employer nor does cognizant place l1b holders at third party sites in an arrangement to provide labor for the third party without providing a service involving cognizant’s specialized knowledge however it is not yet clear how the us department of state and citizenship and immigration services will interpret these provisions of the new law if these provisions are interpreted in a very restrictive fashion this could impair our ability to staff our projects in the us with resources from our entities abroad we also process immigrant visas for lawful permanent residence for employees to fill positions for which there are no able willing and qualified us workers available to fill the positions compliance with existing us immigration and labor laws or changes in those laws making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting our ability to successfully obtain permanent residence for our foreign employees in the united states could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the united states any of these restrictions or 20 

limitations on our hiring practices could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition to immigration restrictions in the united states there have recently been changes to work permit legislation in the united kingdom where we have experienced significant growth under the new regulations in order for us to transfer our employees to the united kingdom either from the united states or from india we must demonstrate that the employee had been employed by us for at least six months prior to the transfer these restrictions restrain our ability to add the skilled professionals we need for our operations in europe and could have an adverse affect on our international strategy to expand our presence in europe as a result the changes to work permit legislation in the united kingdom could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the united states the united kingdom and other countries is subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement immigration and work permit laws and regulation can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity our international expansion strategy and our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with it professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed   potential antioutsourcing legislation could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our customers the issue of outsourcing of services abroad by american companies is a topic of political discussion in the united states measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by us companies are under discussion in congress and in as many as onehalf of the state legislatures while no substantive antioutsourcing legislation has been introduced to date given the intensifying debate over this issue the introduction of such legislation is possible if introduced such measures are likely to fall within two categories 1 a broadening of restrictions on outsourcing by federal government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly andor 2 measures that impact private industry such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions in the event that any such measures become law our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and our ability to service our customer could be impaired   hostilities involving the united states could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our customers hostilities involving the united states or military or travel disruptions and restrictions affecting our employees could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to service our customers as of december 31 2004 a majority of our technical professionals were located in india and the vast majority of our technical professionals in the united states and europe are indian nationals who are able to work in the united states and europe only because they hold current visas travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional 21 

unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the united states and europe   our ability to operate and compete effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of the key members of our management team as well as marketing sales and technical personnel and our ability to attract and retain new management and other personnel we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or significant employees competition for personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting and retaining new personnel in the future the loss of any one or more of our key personnel or the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   restrictions in noncompetition agreements with our executive officers may not be enforceable we have entered into noncompetition agreements with all of our executive officers there can be no assurance however that the restrictions in these agreements prohibiting the executive officers from engaging in competitive activities are enforceable further substantially all of our professional nonexecutive staff are not covered by agreements that would prohibit them from working for our competitors if any of our key professional personnel leaves our employment and joins one of our competitors our business could be adversely affected   our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate earnings in india prior to january 1 2002 it was our intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from india to the united states during the first quarter of 2002 we made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in india and geographic expansion in europe and asia as a component of this strategy we generally have used indian earnings to expand operations outside of the united states instead of repatriating these earnings to the united states accordingly effective january 1 2002 pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 23 “accounting for income taxesspecial areas” we no longer have to accrue incremental united states taxes on all indian earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur in the future that could effectively force us to change our intent on repatriating indian earnings if we change our intent and repatriate such earnings we will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than the effective rate in 2004 these increased taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 22 

  a significant portion of our projects are on a fixedprice basis subjecting us to the risks associated with cost overruns and operating cost inflation we contract to provide services either on a timeandmaterials basis or on a fixedprice basis with fixedprice contracts accounting for approximately 24 and 26 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively we expect that an increasing number of our future projects will be contracted on a fixedprice basis we bear the risk of cost overruns and operating cost inflation in connection with projects covered by fixedprice contracts our failure to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a fixedprice project or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within the time frame committed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   our business may suffer if we are unable to manage our rapid growth our anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources in particular we will have to continue to increase the number of our personnel particularly skilled technical marketing and management personnel and continue to develop and improve our operational financial communications and other internal systems our inability to manage our anticipated growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as part of our growth strategy we are expanding our operations in europe and asia we may not be able to compete effectively in these markets and the cost of entering these markets may be substantially greater than we expect if we fail to compete effectively in the new markets we enter or if the cost of entering those markets is substantially greater than we expect our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition if we cannot compete effectively we may be required to reconsider our strategy to invest in our international expansion plans and change our intent on the repatriation of our earnings   we rely on a few customers for a large portion of our revenues approximately 38 36 and 38 of our revenues in years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively were generated from our top five customers approximately 137 of our revenues in the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 were generated from jpmorgan chase the volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year and a major customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year the loss of one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   we generally do not have longterm contracts with our customers consistent with industry practice we generally do not enter into longterm contracts with our customers as a result we are substantially exposed to volatility in the market for our services and may not be able to maintain our level of profitability if we are unable to market our services on terms we find acceptable our financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 23 

  our operating results experience significant quarterly fluctuations we historically have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations and expect these fluctuations to continue among the factors causing these variations have been  in addition our future revenues operating results and margins may fluctuate as a result of  a high percentage of our operating expenses particularly personnel and rent are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter as a result unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects or in employee wage levels and utilization rates may cause significant variations in our operating results in any particular quarter and could result in losses any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations any material reduction in utilization rates for our professional staff or variance in the onsite offshore staffing mix an unanticipated termination of a major project a customer’s decision not to pursue a new project or proceed to succeeding stages of a current project or the completion during a quarter of several major customer projects could require us to pay underutilized employees and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as a result of these factors it is possible that in some future periods our revenues and operating results may be significantly below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in such an event the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 24 

  we may not be able to sustain our current level of profitability our gross margin of 455 and 458 and our operating margin of 200 and 196 for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively may decline if we experience declines in demand and pricing for our services in addition wages in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states which could result in us incurring increased costs for technical professionals although we have been able to partially offset wage increases and foreign currency fluctuations through further leveraging of our lowcost operating structure and obtaining price increases there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future   liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for the failure although we attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our it development and maintenance services there can be no assurance that any contractual limitations on liability will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   we may have potential liability arising from the ims health exchange offer in the event that we breach any of our representations in connection with the distribution agreement entered into with ims health we entered into a distribution agreement dated january 7 2003 with ims health the “distribution agreement” that provides among other things that ims health and we will comply with and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with the representations made to and relied upon by mcdermott will  emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding us federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer in addition pursuant to the distribution agreement we agreed to indemnify ims health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach of the representations that we made and were relied upon by mcdermott will  emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer if we breach any of our representations in connection with the distribution agreement the related indemnification liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 25 

  we may be subject to legacy dun  bradstreet liabilities that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in 1996 the dun  bradstreet corporation now known as rh donnelly corporation split itself into three separate companies the dun  bradstreet corporation cognizant corporation and acnielsen corporation in connection with the splitup transaction the dun  bradstreet corporation cognizant corporation renamed nielsen media research of which cognizant technology solutions corporation was once a part and ac nielsen corporation now a subsidiary of the dutch company vnu na entered into a distribution agreement in the 1996 distribution agreement each party assumed the liabilities relating to the businesses allocated to it and agreed to indemnify the other parties and their subsidiaries against those liabilities and certain other matters the 1996 distribution agreement also prohibited each party thereto from distributing to our stockholders any business allocated to it unless the distributed business delivered undertakings agreeing to be jointly and severally liable to the other parties under the 1996 distribution agreement for the liabilities of the distributing parent company under the 1996 distribution agreement ims health made such undertaking when it was spun off by nielsen media research in 1998 and accordingly ims health and nielsen media research are jointly and severally liable to rh donnelly and acnielsen for cognizant corporation obligations under the terms of the 1996 distribution agreement ims health has requested similar undertakings from cognizant technology solutions corporation as a condition to the distribution of our shares in the exchange offer ims health is obligated to procure similar undertakings from cognizant technology solutions corporation to nielsen media research and synavant inc with respect to liabilities allocated to ims health in connection with nielsen media research’s spinoff of ims health and ims health’s spinoff of synavant inc in connection with the exchange offer cognizant technology solutions corporation has given these undertakings and as a result cognizant technology solutions corporation may be subject to claims in the future in relation to legacy liabilities one possible legacy liability arises from a pending antitrust action filed by information resources inc in 1996 which names as joint defendants all parties to the 1996 distribution agreement information resources’ complaint alleges damages in excess of 350 million which amount it has asked to be trebled plus punitive damages acnielsen corporation agreed in connection with the 1996 distribution agreement to assume any and all liabilities resulting from the information resources claim to the extent that acnielsen remains financially viable in connection with vnu’s acquisition of acnielsen in 2001 vnu was required to assume this liability and to be included with acnielsen for purposes of determining the amount that can be paid by acnielsen in respect of any claim ims health and nielsen media research inc successors to cognizant corporation have agreed to share liabilities in excess of the amount acnielsen is required to pay under the 1996 distribution agreement in respect of this claim on a 5050 basis with the dun  bradstreet corporation subsequently separated into the dun  bradstreet corporation and moody’s corporation ims health and nielsen media research inc further agreed to share their portion of the liabilities in relation to the information resources action on a 7525 basis subject to nielsen media research inc’s liability in respect of the information resources action and certain other contingent liabilities being capped at 125 million pursuant to our undertaking cognizant technology solutions corporation could be held liable for those amounts that vnu ims health nielsen media research inc and the dun  bradstreet corporation and their successors are unable or unwilling to pay 26 

other claims have arisen in the past and may arise in the future under the 1996 distribution agreement or the distribution agreements relating to nielsen media research’s spinoff of ims health and ims health’s spinoff of synavant inc in which case cognizant technology solutions corporation may be jointly and severally liable for any losses suffered by the parties entitled to indemnification ims health has agreed to indemnify cognizant technology solutions corporation for any and all liabilities that arise out of our undertakings to be jointly and severally liable for these liabilities but if for any reason ims health does not perform on our indemnification obligation these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations   if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others our business may be adversely affected our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights we presently hold no patents or registered copyrights and rely upon a combination of copyright and trade secret laws nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and various security measures to protect our intellectual property rights india is a member of the berne convention and has agreed to recognize protections on copyrights conferred under the laws of foreign countries including the laws of the united states we believe that laws rules regulations and treaties in effect in the united states and india are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our copyrights however there can be no assurance that these laws will not change and in particular that the laws of india will not change in ways that may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components libraries and toolsets from india to the united states there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of any of our intellectual property or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in development of technology products or services which compete with our products and unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products services or proprietary information although we believe that our intellectual property rights do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of any of our competitors or others there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted against us in the future that assertion of infringement claims will not result in litigation or that we would prevail in that litigation or be able to obtain a license for the use of any infringed intellectual property from a third party on commercially reasonable terms if at all we expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our competitors are able to obtain patents for software products and processes any infringement claims regardless of their outcome could result in substantial cost to us and divert management’s attention from our operations any infringement claim or litigation against us could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 27 

  we may be unable to integrate acquired companies or technologies successfully we believe that opportunities exist in the fragmented it services market to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions and joint ventures we believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence especially in the european market enter new technology areas or expand our capacity there can be no assurance that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices consummate any acquisition or joint venture or successfully integrate any acquired business or joint venture into our operations further acquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of special risks including diversion of management’s attention failure to retain key personnel unanticipated events or circumstances and legal liabilities some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we may finance any future acquisitions with debt financing the issuance of equity securities or a combination of the foregoing there can be no assurance that we will be able to arrange cash adequate financing on acceptable terms in addition acquisitions financed with the issuance of our equity securities could be dilutive   provisions in our charter bylaws and stockholders’ rights plan and provisions under delaware law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals provisions in our charter and bylaws each as amended our stockholders’ rights plan and delaware general corporate law “dgcl” may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover proposals or delaying or preventing changes in our control or management including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices in addition these documents and provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests our board of directors has the authority without further action by the stockholders to fix the rights and preferences and issue shares of preferred stock our charter provides for a classified board of directors which will prevent a change of control of our board of directors at a single meeting of stockholders the prohibition of our stockholders’ ability to act by written consent and to call a special meeting will delay stockholder actions until annual meetings or until a special meeting is called by our chairman or chief executive officer or our board of directors the supermajorityvoting requirement for specified amendments to our charter and bylaws allows a minority of our stockholders to block those amendments the dgcl also contains provisions preventing stockholders from engaging in business combinations with us subject to certain exceptions these provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock

on april 12 2004 our board of directors declared a conditional twoforone stock split to be effected by a 100 stock dividend payable on june 17 2004 to stockholders of record as of may 27 2004 the stock split was subject to stockholder approval which was obtained on may 26 2004 and as a result the stock dividend was paid on june 17 2004 to stockholders of record as of may 27 2004 the stock split has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and all applicable references as to the number of outstanding common shares and per share information have been restated to reflect the stock split as if it occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented stockholders’ equity accounts have been restated to reflect a reclassification of an amount equal to the par value of the increase in issued shares of class a common stock from the additional paidincapital account to the class a common stock account critical accounting estimates and risks management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixedbid contracts the allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual amounts will differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting policies require higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements   revenue recognition  revenues related to our fixedprice contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting under which the total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s cost to date bears to the total estimated cost cost to cost method estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified   allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative creditworthiness of 36 

each customer historical collections experience and other information including the aging of the receivables if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required   income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance if any involves judgment as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve in the period of resolution adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate on an ongoing basis we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or equity if the deferred tax asset is related to tax benefits from stock option benefits that have not been realized in the period such determination was made our indian subsidiary cognizant india is an exportoriented company which under the indian income tax act of 1961 is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each software technology park stp with respect to export profits for each stp substantially all of the earnings of cognizant india are attributable to export profits in 2004 the tenyear tax holiday expired for one stp and accordingly the export profits for that stp are subject to indian income tax export profits from the remaining stps in india are currently entitled to a 100 exemption from indian income tax under current law these tax holidays will be completely phased out by march of 2009 the tax holiday will not be expiring for any stps in 2005 prior to 2002 it was management’s intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from india to the united states accordingly we provided for deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately 241 million on all such undistributed earnings through december 31 2001 during the first quarter of 2002 we made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in india and geographic expansion in europe and asia as a component of this strategy beginning in 2002 we intend to use indian earnings to expand operations outside of the united states instead of repatriating these earnings to the united states accordingly effective january 1 2002 pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 23 we no longer accrue incremental us taxes on indian earnings as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states as of december 31 2004 the amount of unrepatriated indian earnings upon which no incremental us taxes have been recorded is approximately 1559 million while we have no plans to do so if such earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a rate 37 

substantially higher than our overall effective income tax rate in 2004 due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation or whether the amount of previously accrued deferred taxes on earnings recognized prior to 2002 will require adjustment on october 22 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 “act” was enacted into law the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and as of today uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the act as such we are not yet in a position to decide on whether and to what extent we might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us under the provisions of the act and subject to the completion of our analysis of the act and the operating results of our controlled foreign entities during 2005 we will be eligible to repatriate some amount between 0 and 500 million due to the complexities of domestic and foreign tax law and the lack of clarity surrounding the act we cannot reasonably estimate the tax liability if we elect to repatriate any accumulated foreign earnings we expect to finalize our assessment in 2005 after further guidance is published  the funds may only be repatriated in 2005   goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant when determining the fair value of our reporting units we utilize various assumptions including projections of future cash flows any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge as of december 31 2004 our goodwill balance was approximately 97 million   longlived assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we review for impairment of longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in general we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset if such assets were determined to be impaired it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   risks most of our it development centers including a majority of our employees are located in india as a result we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potential geopolitical and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers we are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance 38 

with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the inability of our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us including but not limited to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which could cause the market price of our stock to decline see item 1 “business – additional factors that may affect future results” for discussion of additional risks that may affect our business operations or financial results results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data expressed for the three years ended december 31 2004 dollars in thousands  

year ended december 31 2004 compared to year ended december 31 2003   revenue  revenue increased by 593 or approximately 2184 million from approximately 3682 million during 2003 to approximately 5867 million in 2004 this increase resulted primarily from increased revenue from existing customers and revenue from new customers added since december 31 2003 including acquisitions specifically our financial services segment accounted for approximately 120 million of the year over year increase demand for application development and integration services increased significantly due to continued strength in our customers’ discretionary spending jpmorgan chase accounted for 137 and 101 of our revenues in 2004 and 2003 respectively no other customer accounted for sales in excess of 10 of revenues in 2004 or 2003   gross profit  our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries payroll taxes benefits immigration and travel for technical personnel and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues cost of revenues increased by 601 or approximately 1201 million from approximately 1997 million during 2003 to approximately 3198 million in 2004 the 39 

increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals the increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services our gross profit increased by 584 or approximately 984 million from approximately 1685 million during 2003 to approximately 2669 million during 2004 gross profit margin decreased from 458 of revenues during 2003 to 455 of revenues in 2004 the decrease in such gross profit margin was attributable in part to the appreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar   selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits travel promotion communications management finance administrative and occupancy costs selling general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization increased by 551 or approximately 530 million from approximately 962 million during 2003 to approximately 1492 million during 2004 and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 261 to 254 respectively the increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that have resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years partially offset by the appreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar   income from operations  income from operations increased 627 or approximately 453 million from approximately 723 million during 2003 to approximately 1176 million during 2004 representing approximately 196 and 200 of revenues respectively the increase in operating margin was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years   other incomeexpense net other incomeexpense net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains or losses and for the year ended december 31 2003 nonrecurring splitoff costs of 20 million related to direct and incremental expenses  eg  legal and accounting fees printing and registration costs incurred by us directly related to our splitoff from ims health interest income increased from 21 million during 2003 to approximately 44 million during 2004 the increase in interest income is due primarily to higher invested cash balances and an increased portion of this balance held in foreign currencies which earn slightly higher interest rates   provision for income taxes  the provision for income taxes increased from approximately 149 million in 2003 to approximately 219 million in 2004 with an effective tax rate of 206 in 2003 and 179 in 2004 the decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2004 is primarily attributed to india’s conversion of the withholding tax on dividends to an additional corporate tax on the distribution of profits   net income  net income increased from approximately 574 million in 2003 to approximately 1002 million in 2004 representing approximately 156 and 171 as a percentage of revenues respectively the increase in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior period was primarily due to the absence in 2004 of the onetime non 40 

recurring splitoff costs referred to above and a lower effective income tax rate for 2004 compared to 2003 year ended december 31 2003 compared to year ended december 31 2002   revenue  revenue increased by 607 or approximately 1391 million from approximately 2291 million during 2002 to approximately 3682 million in 2003 this increase resulted primarily from an increase in both application management and development services revenue generated from acquisitions and an increase in our active customer base to 153 at the end of 2003 compared to 115 in 2002 we provide services through timeandmaterials and fixedbid contracts revenues from fixedbid contracts increased as a percentage of total revenues from 246 in 2002 to 259 in 2003 this increase is attributable primarily to increased demand due to our customers preferring to specifically quantify project costs prior to entering into contracts   gross profit  our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries payroll taxes benefits immigration and travel for technical personnel and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues cost of revenues increased by 628 or approximately 770 million from approximately 1227 million during 2002 to approximately 1997 million in 2003 the increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals the increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services and employees acquired through acquisitions our gross profit increased by 584 or approximately 621 million from approximately 1064 million during 2002 to approximately 1685 million during 2003 gross profit margin decreased from 464 of revenues during 2002 to 458 of revenues in 2003 the decrease in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the appreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar   selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits travel promotion communications management finance administrative and occupancy costs selling general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization increased by 572 or approximately 350 million from approximately 612 million during 2002 to approximately 962 million during 2003 and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 267 to 261 respectively the increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that have resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years   income from operations  income from operations increased 600 or approximately 271 million from approximately 452 million during 2002 to approximately 723 million during 2003 representing approximately 197 and 196 of revenues respectively the decrease in operating margin was due primarily to the lower gross margin partially offset by our ability to leverage prior sales and marketing investments 41 

  other incomeexpense net  other incomeexpense net consists primarily of interest income and splitoff costs related to the exchange offer in which ims health offered to its stockholders to exchange its holdings of our class b common stock for shares of ims health interest income increased by approximately 177 from approximately 18 million during 2002 to approximately 21 million during 2003 the increase in such interest income was attributable to higher invested cash balances partially offset by lower global interest rates we recognized splitoff costs of approximately 20 million and 17 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively   provision for income taxes  the provision for income taxes increased from approximately 105 million in 2002 to approximately 149 million in 2003 with an effective tax rate of 234 in 2002 and 206 in 2003 the lower effective tax rate is a result of a reduction in the surtax in india and the restoration of the 100 exemption on export earnings both of which were effective april 1 2003   net income  net income increased from approximately 346 million in 2002 to approximately 574 million in 2003 representing approximately 151 and 156 as a percentage of revenues respectively the higher percentage in 2003 is primarily attributed to the decrease in the effective tax rate discussed above results by business segment during the fourth quarter of 2004 as a result of the completion of organizational changes we changed our basis of segmentation to industry segments from geographic segments our reportable segments are financial services which includes customers providing banking  transaction processing capital markets and insurance services healthcare which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers manufacturing  retail  logistics which includes manufacturers retailers travel and other hospitality customers as well as customers providing logistics services and other which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which individually are less than 10 of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit the other reportable segment includes media information services telecommunications and high technology operating segments our sales managers account executives account managers and project teams who were previously organized based upon geographical segments have been realigned in accordance with the specific industries they serve the company’s chief operating decision maker evaluates cognizant’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors pressures and challenges however the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers certain expenses such as general and administrative and a portion of depreciation and amortization are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment 42 

accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as “unallocated” and adjusted only against the total income from operations in accordance with sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” prior periods segment disclosure has been restated to reflect industry segments for all periods presented revenues from external customers and segment operating profit before unallocated expenses for the financial services healthcare manufacturing  retail  logistics and other reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 are as follows dollars in thousands

existing operations including our offshore software development centers ii continued development of new service lines iii possible acquisitions of related businesses iv formation of joint ventures and v general corporate purposes including working capital as of december 31 2004 and 2003 we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately 3389 and 2206 million respectively accordingly we do not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 1273 million 799 million and 567 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the increase in 2004 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income trade accounts receivable increased from approximately 367 million at december 31 2002 to approximately 523 million at december 31 2003 and to approximately 964 million at december 31 2004 unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately 43 million at december 31 2002 to approximately 95 million at december 31 2003 and increased to approximately 142 million at december 31 2004 the increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2004 was due primarily to increased revenue we monitor turnover aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff at december 31 2004 our days’ sales outstanding including unbilled receivables was approximately 59 days as compared to 53 days and 56 days at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively our investing activities used net cash of approximately 684 million 378 million and 355 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the increase in 2004 compared to 2003 relates to the investment of a portion of our cash balances in short term bank deposits to achieve a higher return on invested balances and our increased investment in property and equipment to expand our offshore development structure the increase in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily reflects our increased investment in property and equipment to expand our offshore development infrastructure offset in part by lower spending for acquisitions in 2003 our financing activities provided net cash of approximately 368 million 218 million and 200 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the increase in each year was primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of stock partially offset by payment of splitoff costs in 2003 we believe that our available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our longterm capital requirements beyond this 12month period will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flow increases our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from india our ability not to breach the distribution agreement between ims health and us especially as it relates to our tax indemnities and the availability of public and private debt and equity 46

in connection with our acquisition of infopulse additional purchase price not to exceed 35 million euros approximately 47 million is payable in 2006 contingent on infopulse achieving certain revenue and operating income targets for the 24 month period ending december 31 2005 in addition approximately 11 million of the total infopulse purchase price is payable in 2005 we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management the outcome of such claims and legal actions if decided adversely is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results cash flows or consolidated financial position additionally many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers’ business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify any failure in a customer’s computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts errors mistakes or omissions in rendering our application design development and maintenance services there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages although we have general liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors or omissions there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results financial position and cash flows in connection with the splitoff from ims health we entered into a distribution agreement dated january 7 2003 with ims health referred to as the distribution agreement the distribution agreement provides among other things that ims health and we will comply with and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with the representations made to and relied upon by mcdermott will  emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer in addition pursuant to the distribution agreement we indemnified ims health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach in the representations we made to and were relied upon by mcdermott will  emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer if we breach any of our representations in connection with the distribution agreement the related indemnification liability could be material to our quarterly and annual operating results financial position and cash flows foreign currency translation a portion of our costs in india are denominated in local currency and subject to exchange fluctuations which has an impact on our results of operations 48 

related party transactions as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements on february 13 2003 the “splitoff date” ims health distributed all of the cognizant common stock that ims health owned in an exchange offer to ims health stockholders the “splitoff” as a result of the splitoff ims health is no longer a related party as of the splitoff date accordingly our revenues from ims health subsequent to the splitoff date are classified as third party revenues we recognized related party revenues from ims health totaling approximately 26 million and 204 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively total revenues from ims health during 2003 including related party revenues prior to the splitoff date were approximately 227 million effects of inflation our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals competition in india the united states and europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation as with other it service providers we must adequately anticipate wage increases particularly on our fixedprice contracts there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the united states and elsewhere recent accounting pronouncements on december 16 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas no 123r which is a revision of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas no 123 sfas no 123r supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb no 25 and amends sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows” generally the approach in sfas no 123r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 123 however sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options and issuances under employee stock purchase plans to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard we must adopt sfas no 123r no later than july 1 2005 early adoption is permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued we expect to adopt sfas no 123r on july 1 2005 sfas no 123r allows for two transition methods the basic difference between the two methods is that the modifiedprospective transition method does not require restatement of prior periods whereas the modifiedretrospective transition method will require restatement as permitted by sfas no 123 we currently account for sharebased payments to employees using apb no 25’s intrinsic value method and as such generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options or stock issuances under the employee stock purchase plan although the full impact of our adoption of sfas no 123r’s fair value method has not yet been determined we expect that it will have a significant impact on our results of operations the disclosure under sfas no 123 of pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had recognized compensation cost for sharebased payments under sfas no 123 for 49 

the three years ended december 31 2004 is not necessarily indicative of the potential impact of recognizing compensation cost for sharebased payments under sfas no 123r in future periods the potential impact of adopting sfas no 123r is dependent on levels of sharebased payments granted the specific option pricing model utilized to determine fair value and the transition methodology selected forward looking statements the statements contained in this annual report on form 10k that are not historical facts are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended that involve risks and uncertainties such forwardlooking statements may be identified by among other things the use of forwardlooking terminology such as “believes” “expects” “may” “will” “should” or “anticipates” or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties from time to time we or our representatives have made or may make forwardlooking statements orally or in writing such forwardlooking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the securities and exchange commission or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers these forwardlooking statements such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues contract percentage completions capital expenditures and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts involve predictions our actual results performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in or implied by these forwardlooking statements there are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forwardlooking statements these factors include those set forth in the section entitled “additional factors that may affect future results” 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies particularly the indian rupee accordingly we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations during july 2004 we entered into a foreign currency forward contract with a sixmonth term and notional amount of 125 million to sell the indian rupee for us dollars we may continue to enter into such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies other than the aforementioned forward contract we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm bank deposits as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 3148 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm bank deposits which are impacted almost immediately by changes in shortterm interest rates 50

industry background


      many  companies  today  face  intense  competitive  pressure  and  rapidly
changing  market  dynamics  in addition  the evolution of  technology  and the
commercialization  of the internet have  contributed  to the rapid change in the
business  environment  in  response to these  challenges  many  companies  are
focused on improving productivity increasing service levels lowering costs and
accelerating  delivery  times  in order to achieve  these goals  companies are
implementing a broad range of technologies such as

      o     ebusiness and ecommerce applications

      o     data warehousing

      o     customer and supply chain management and

      o     middlewareenterprise application integration

      these technologies facilitate faster more responsive lowercost business
operations  however  their development  integration and ongoing  maintenance
present  major   challenges  and  require  a  large  number  of  highly  skilled
professionals trained in many diverse technologies  in addition companies also
require  additional  technical  resources to maintain  enhance and  reengineer
their core legacy it systems and to address  application  maintenance  projects
increasingly  companies are relying on custom it solutions  providers  such as
us to provide these services

      in order to respond  effectively  to a changing and  challenging  business
environment  it  departments of many  companies  have focused  increasingly  on
improving  returns  on it  investments  lowering  costs  and  accelerating  the
delivery of new systems and solutions  to accomplish these objectives  many it
departments  have shifted all or a portion of their it development  integration
and  maintenance  requirements  to  outside  service  providers  operating  with
onsiteoffshore business models

      global  demand for high  quality  lower  cost it  services  from  outside
providers has created a significant  opportunity  for it service  providers that
can successfully  leverage the benefits of and address the challenges in using
an offshore  talent pool  the effective  use of offshore  personnel can offer a
variety of benefits  including lower costs faster delivery of new it solutions
and more flexible scheduling certain developing countries  particularly india
have a large talent pool of highly qualified  technical  professionals  that can
provide  high  quality  it  services  at a lower  cost  india is a leader in it
services and is regarded as having one of the largest pools of it talent in the
world  historically  it  service  providers  have used  offshore  labor  pools
primarily to  supplement  the internal  staffing  needs of  customers  however
evolving  customer  demands  have led to the  increasing  acceptance  and use of
offshore  resources for higher  valueadded  services  these  services  include
application design development  integration and maintenance  indias services
and  software  exports  have grown from 760  billion for the fiscal year ended
march 31 2002 to 955  billion for the fiscal  year ended march 31  2003  as
estimated  by the  national  association  of  software  and  services  companies
nasscom in india this represents a 26 growth over the prior period  nasscom
has  projected  indias  services  and  software  exports  to  grow at a rate of
approximately 28 for fiscal year 200304

      using an offshore  workforce to provide  valueadded  services  presents a
number of challenges to it service  providers  the offshore  implementation  of
valueadded  it services  requires  that it service  providers  continually  and
effectively  attract  train and  retain  highly  skilled  software  development
professionals  with the advanced  technical  skills  necessary to keep pace with
continuing  changes in information  technology  evolving industry standards and
changing customer preferences these skills are necessary to design develop and
deploy highquality  technology solutions in a costeffective and timely manner
in addition  it service  providers must have the  methodologies  processes and
communications  capabilities  to enable  offshore  workforces to be successfully
integrated  with  onsite  personnel  service  providers  must also have strong
research  and  development  capabilities   technology  competency  centers  and
relationship management skills in order to compete effectively

our solution


      we believe that we have developed an effective integrated onsiteoffshore
business model  and that this business model will be a critical  element of our
continued  growth  to support this  business  model  at december 31 2003  we

technology and  communications  infrastructure  in order to support our business
model  by basing  certain  technical  operations in india  we have access to a
large pool of skilled englishspeaking it professionals these it professionals
provide high quality services to our customers at costs significantly lower than
services sourced  exclusively in developed  countries  our strengths  which we
believe differentiate us from other it service providers include the following

      established  and  scalable  proprietary   processes   we  have  developed
proprietary   methodologies  for  integrating  onsite  and  offshore  teams  to
facilitate  costeffective  ontime  delivery of highquality  projects  these
methodologies  comprise our  proprietary  qview software  engineering  process
which is  available  to all onsite and  offshore  programmers  we use this iso
90012000  certified  process to define and implement  projects from the design
development and deployment stages through to ongoing  application  maintenance
for most


                                       5

projects  qview is used as part of an  initial  assessment  that  allows us to
define the scope and risks of the project and subdivide the project into smaller
phases with frequent  deliverables and feedback from customers  we also use our
qview process to detect  mitigate and correct  possible quality defects and to
establish  appropriate  contingencies  for each  project  in  order  to  ensure
implementation of the quality process  we assign a quality  facilitator to each
project who reports to a centralized quality assurance and software  engineering
group  this group performs  on a sample basis  quality  audits  deliverables
verifications  metrics  collection  and  analysis  which  are used to  improve
processes and methodologies these processes and methodologies have proven to be
scalable as we have significantly  increased the number of offshore development
centers  customers and projects in addition  all of our principal development
centers have been assessed by kpmg at level 5 the highest  possible  rating of
both the capability maturity model and the capability maturity model integration

customer projects this infrastructure allows for

      o     rapid completion of projects

      o     highest level of quality

      o     offpeak use of customers technological resources and

      o     realtime  access to  project  information  by the  onsite  account

europe during offpeak hours  this ability to perform  services during offpeak
hours  enables us to  complete  projects  more  rapidly and does not require our
customers to invest in duplicative hardware and software in addition for large
projects  with short time  frames  our offshore  facilities  allow for parallel
processing  of  various  development  phases to  accelerate  delivery  time  in
addition  we can deliver services more rapidly than some competitors without an
offshore labor pool because our lower labor costs enable us to  costeffectively
assign more professionals to a project

additional factors that may affect future results


      if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial  condition
results of operations or prospects could be materially  adversely  affected  in
such case the trading price of our common stock could decline

a substantial  portion of our assets and  operations are located in india and we
are subject to regulatory economic and political uncertainties in india

      we intend to  continue to develop and expand our  offshore  facilities  in
india where as of december 31 2003 a majority of our technical  professionals
were located  while wage costs are lower in india than in the united states and
other developed countries for comparably skilled  professionals  wages in india
are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states which could result in
our incurring increased costs for technical  professionals and reduced operating
margins  in  addition  there  is  intense  competition  in india  for  skilled
technical professionals and we expect that competition to increase

      india  has  also  experienced  civil  unrest  and  terrorism  and has been
involved in conflicts with neighboring  countries  in recent years  there have
been  military  confrontations  between india and pakistan that have occurred in
the region of kashmir and along the  indianpakistan  border  the potential for
hostilities between the two countries has been high in light of tensions related
to recent terrorist  incidents in india and the unsettled nature of the regional
geopolitical  environment  including  events in and related to afghanistan  if
india  were to  become  engaged  in  armed  hostilities  particularly  if these
hostilities  were protracted or involved the threat of or use of weapons of mass
destruction our operations would be materially adversely affected in addition
us  companies  may  decline  to  contract  with us for  services  in  light of
international  terrorist  incidents or armed hostilities even where india is not
involved  because  of more  generalized  concerns  about  relying  on a  service
provider utilizing international resources

      in the past  the indian  economy  has  experienced  many of the  problems
confronting  the economies of developing  countries  including high  inflation
erratic gross  domestic  product growth and shortages of foreign  exchange  the
indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant  influence
over  many  aspects  of  the  indian  economy  and  indian  government  actions
concerning  the economy could have a material  adverse  effect on private sector
entities  including  us  in the  past  the  indian  government  has  provided
significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory  restrictions in order
to encourage foreign  investment in


                                       18

specified sectors of the economy  including the software  development  services
industry  programs that have benefited us include  among others tax holidays
liberalized   import  and  export  duties  and  preferential  rules  on  foreign
investment and repatriation notwithstanding these benefits indias central and
state  governments  remain  significantly  involved  in the  indian  economy  as
regulators  the  elimination  of any of the  benefits  realized  by us from our
indian operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  results
of operations and financial condition

general elections are declared to take place in india in april 2004 the outcome
of the elections will determine the new government  which may be a coalition of
different  parties  than  existing  the approach of the new  government  on the
economic reforms if different  may have an impact on our financial results we
cannot  assure the  positive  trend in current  reforms  may  continue  and such
changes may have a material adverse impact on our financials

      since  1991  successive  governments  in india have  pursued  policies of
economic reform  including  significantly  relaxing restrictions on the private
sector the current indian government formed in october 1999 is a coalition of
several parties including some small regional parties the withdrawal of one or
more of these  parties  from the current  coalition  could  result in  political
instability political instability or further changes in the government in india
could  delay the reform of the indian  economy  and  adversely  affect  economic
conditions  in india  generally  which could impact our  financial  results and
prospects  the current  indian  government has generally  pursued  policies and
taken initiatives that support the continued  economic reform policies that have
been pursued by previous  governments  these economic reform policies have also
been advocated by the opposition  parties we cannot be assured  however  that
these policies and initiatives will continue in the future the rate of economic
reform  could  change  and  specific  laws and  policies  affecting  technology
companies foreign investment currency exchange and other matters affecting our
business could change as well a significant  change in indias  economic reform
and   deregulation   policies  could  adversely  affect  business  and  economic
conditions in india generally and our business in particular

      no  assurance  can be given  that we will  not be  adversely  affected  by
changes in  inflation  interest  rates  taxation  social  stability  or other
political  economic or  diplomatic  developments  in or affecting  india in the
future

hostilities  between  the  united  states and iraq  could  adversely  affect our
business  financial  condition and results of operations and impair our ability
to service our customers

      tensions  between  the united  states and iraq have  escalated  due to the
united states invasion of and ongoing conflict with iraq  hostilities involving
the united states or military or travel disruptions and restrictions  affecting
our employees  could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability
to service our  customers  as of december 31 2003 a majority of our technical
professionals  were  located in india  and the vast  majority of our  technical
professionals  in the united states and europe are indian nationals who are able
to work in the united  states and europe only because  they hold current  visas
travel  restrictions  could cause

us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our
ability to retain the skilled  professionals  we need for our  operations in the
united states and europe

our international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties

      revenues from customers outside north america represented 12 13 and 15
of our  revenues  for  the  years  ended  december  31  2003  2002  and  2001
respectively  we anticipate that revenues from customers  outside north america
will  continue  to  account  for a  material  portion  of  our  revenues  in the
foreseeable  future and may  increase as we expand our  international  presence
particularly in europe in addition a substantial majority of our employees and
almost all of our it development  centers are located in india as a result  we
may be subject to risks  associated  with  international  operations  including
risks  associated with foreign  currency  exchange rate  fluctuations  and risks
associated  with the  application  and imposition of protective  legislation and
regulations  relating to import or export or  otherwise  resulting  from foreign
policy or the variability of foreign economic  conditions  to date we have not
engaged in any hedging  transactions  to mitigate our risks relating to exchange
rate  fluctuations  additional risks associated with  international  operations
include difficulties in enforcing  intellectual  property rights the burdens of
complying  with  a  wide  variety  of  foreign  laws  potentially  adverse  tax
consequences  tariffs  quotas and other barriers and potential difficulties in
collecting accounts  receivable  there can be no assurance that these and other
factors  will not have a material  adverse  effect on our  business  results of
operations and financial condition

we face intense competition from other it service providers

      the intensely competitive it professional services market includes a large
number of  participants  and is subject to rapid  change  this market  includes
participants from a variety of market segments including

      o     systems integration firms

      o     contract programming companies

      o     application software companies

      o     internet solutions providers

      o     the professional  services groups of computer  equipment  companies
            and

      o     facilities management and outsourcing companies

      the market also includes numerous smaller local competitors in the various
geographic  markets  in which we  operate  our direct  competitors  who use the
onsiteoffshore  business  model include  among others  infosys  inc  tata
consultancy  services and wipro ltd in addition  many of our competitors  have
significantly  greater financial  technical and marketing resources and greater
name recognition than we do some of these larger competitors such as accenture
ltd  electronic  data  systems  corporation  and  ibm  global  services  have
announced  their  intentions  to develop their  offshore  operations in order to
lower their cost structure we

cannot  assure  you  that  we will be able to  sustain  our  current  levels  of
profitability  or growth as competitive  pressures  including  competition  for
skilled it  development  professionals  and pricing  pressure  from  competitors
employing an onsiteoffshore business model increase

our  business  will  suffer if we fail to develop new  services  and enhance our
existing services in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving  technological
environment

      the it services market is  characterized  by rapid  technological  change
evolving industry standards  changing customer  preferences and new product and
service introductions  our future success will depend on our ability to develop
solutions that keep pace with changes in the it services market there can be no
assurance  that we will be  successful  in  developing  new services  addressing
evolving  technologies on a timely or costeffective basis or if these services
are developed that we will be successful in the marketplace in addition there
can be no assurance that products  services or technologies developed by others
will not render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to address
these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results
of operations and financial condition

      our  ability  to remain  competitive  will also  depend on our  ability to
design and  implement  in a timely and  costeffective  manner  solutions  for
customers  moving  from the  mainframe  environment  to  clientserver  or other
advanced  architectures  our  failure to design and  implement  solutions  in a
timely and  costeffective  manner could have a material  adverse  effect on our
business results of operations and financial condition

competition for highly skilled technical personnel is intense and the success of
our  business  depends  on our  ability to attract  and  retain  highly  skilled
professionals

      our future  success will depend to a significant  extent on our ability to
attract  train and retain  highly  skilled  it  development  professionals  in
particular  we need to attract train and retain project managers it engineers
and other senior  technical  personnel  we believe  there is a shortage of and
significant  competition for it development  professionals in the united states
and india with the  advanced  technological  skills  necessary  to  perform  the
services we offer we have  subcontracted  to a limited extent in the past and
may do so in the  future  with  other  service  providers  in order to meet our
obligations  to our  customers  our  ability  to  maintain  and renew  existing
engagements  and obtain new business will depend  in large part on our ability
to attract  train and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace
with continuing changes in information  technology  evolving industry standards
and changing customer preferences further we must train and manage our growing
work  force  requiring  an  increase  in the level of  responsibility  for both
existing  and new  management  personnel  there  can be no  assurance  that the
management  skills and  systems  currently  in place will be adequate or that we
will be able to train and assimilate new employees successfully  our failure to
attract  train and  retain  current or future  employees  could have a material
adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

our growth may be hindered by immigration restrictions

      our future  success  will  depend on our  ability  to  attract  and retain
employees  with  technical  and  project   management   skills  from  developing
countries  especially  india  the vast

majority of our it  professionals  in the united states and in europe are indian
nationals  the ability of indian nationals to work in the united states depends
on their ability and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits

      the h1 b visa  classification  enables us  employers to hire  qualified
foreign workers in positions which require an education at least equal to a us
baccalaureate degree in specialty occupations such as it systems engineering and
systems analysis  the h1 b visa usually permits an individual to work and live
in the united  states  for a period of up to six years  there is a limit on the
number of new h1 b petitions that us  citizenship  and  immigration  services
cis one of the  successor  agencies to the  immigration  and  naturalization
service  may approve in any  federal  fiscal  year  and in years in which this
limit is  reached  we may be unable to obtain  h1 b visas  necessary  to bring
foreign  employees to the united states in the current federal fiscal year the
limit is 65000  this cap has been reached as of february  17 2004  new h1 b
petitions may not be filed until april 1 2004 and these  petitions must be for
positions  beginning no earlier than october 1 2004  however as a part of our
advanced planning process we have sufficient  employees  visaready to meet our
anticipated  business growth in the current year in addition  there are strict
labor regulations associated with the h1 b visa classification higher users of
the h1 b visa program are often subject to  investigations by the wage and hour
division of the us  department of labor  a finding by the us  department of
labor  of  willful  or  substantial  failure  by  us  to  comply  with  existing
regulations on the h1 b classification may result in a bar on future use of the
h1 b program

      we also  regularly  transfer  employees of our  subsidiary in india to the
united  states  to work on  projects  and at  client  sites  using the l1 visa
classification  the l1  visa  allows  companies  abroad  to  transfer  certain
managers executives and employees with specialized company knowledge to related
us companies such as a parent subsidiary  affiliate joint venture or branch
office  we have an  approved  blanket l program  under  which the  corporate
relationships of our transferring and receiving  entities have been preapproved
by the cis thus enabling  individual l1 applications to be presented  directly
to a us  consular post abroad rather than undergoing the preapproval  process
in the  united  states  while  there  have been no major  changes in the law or
regulations  governing the l1  categories  both the us  consular  posts that
review initial l1 applications and the cis office which adjudicates extensions
of l1 status have become more restrictive with respect to this category in the
recent past as a result  the rate of refusals of initial l1  applications and
of  extension  denials  has  increased  in  addition  even where l1 visas are
ultimately  granted and issued  security  measures  undertaken by us consular
posts around the world have caused major delays in visa issuances our inability
to bring qualified  technical  personnel into the united states to staff onsite
customer locations would have a material adverse effect on our business results
of operations and financial condition

      in the past year  the press has covered  allegations  of abuse of the l1
visa category by certain  companies  the companies are alleged to have used the
l1  category to bring  workers into the us who then  displace  us  workers
because of this press  attention  congress  has held  hearings  on the l1 visa
category  and  legislators  have  introduced  bills to  change or  restrict  the
standards for the l1 category while none of the proposed legislation has moved
out of the  introductory  stage  it is possible that new  restrictions on the l
visa category will become law if


                                       22

such  restrictive  proposals  become law this could impair our ability to staff
our projects in the us with resources from our entities abroad

      we also  process  immigrant  visas  for  lawful  permanent  residence  for
employees to fill  positions for which there are no able  willing and qualified
us  workers  available to fill the  positions  compliance  with existing us
immigration and labor laws or changes in those laws making it more difficult to
hire foreign nationals or limiting our ability to successfully  obtain permanent
residence for our foreign  employees in the united  states  could require us to
incur  additional  unexpected  labor costs and  expenses or could  restrain  our
ability to retain the skilled  professionals  we need for our  operations in the
united states  any of these restrictions or limitations on our hiring practices
could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and
financial condition

      in addition to immigration  restrictions in the united states  there have
recently been changes to work permit legislation in the united kingdom where we
have experienced significant growth under the new regulations  in order for us
to transfer our employees to the united  kingdom  either from the united states
or from india we must demonstrate that the employee had been employed by us for
at least six months  prior to the  transfer  these  restrictions  restrain  our
ability to add the skilled  professionals  we need for our operations in europe
and could have an adverse  affect on our  international  strategy  to expand our
presence in europe as a result  the changes to work permit  legislation in the
united kingdom could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of
operations and financial condition

      immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the united states the
united kingdom and other countries is subject to legislative and  administrative
changes as well as changes in the  application  of  standards  and  enforcement
immigration and work permit laws and regulation can be significantly affected by
political forces and levels of economic  activity  our international  expansion
strategy and our business  results of operations and financial condition may be
materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and
regulations  or the  administration  or  enforcement of such laws or regulations
impairs our ability to staff projects with it professionals who are not citizens
of the country where the work is to be performed

potential  antioutsourcing  legislation  could  adversely  affect our business
financial  condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service
our customers

      in the past few months  the issue of  outsourcing  of services  abroad by
american  companies  has become a topic of  political  discussion  in the united
states  measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by us companies
are  under  discussion  in  congress  and in as many as  onehalf  of the  state
legislatures   while  no  substantive  antioutsourcing  legislation  has  been
introduced  to  date  given  the  intensifying  debate  over  this  issue  the
introduction of such legislation is possible  if introduced  such measures are
likely to fall  within two  categories  1 a  broadening  of  restrictions  on
outsourcing  by federal  government  agencies and on government  contracts  with
firms that outsource  services directly or indirectly  andor 2 measures that
impact private  industry  such as tax  disincentives  or intellectual  property
transfer  restrictions  in the event that any such  measures  become  law  our
business  financial  condition  and results of  operations  could be  adversely
affected and our ability to service our customer could be impaired

our ability to operate and compete  effectively could be impaired if we lose key
personnel

      our future performance  depends to a significant degree upon the continued
service of the key members of our management  team as well as marketing  sales
and technical  personnel  and our ability to attract and retain new  management
and other  personnel  we do not maintain  key man life  insurance on any of our
executive  officers or  significant  employees  competition  for  personnel  is
intense  and there can be no  assurance  that we will be able to retain our key
employees  or that we  will  be  successful  in  attracting  and  retaining  new
personnel in the future the loss of any one or more of our key personnel or the
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect
on our business results of operations and financial condition

restrictions in  noncompetition  agreements with our executive officers may not
be enforceable

      we have entered  into  noncompetition  agreements  with a majority of our
executive officers there can be no assurance however that the restrictions in
these agreements prohibiting the executive officers from engaging in competitive
activities  are  enforceable  further  substantially  all of our  professional
nonexecutive  staff are not covered by agreements that would prohibit them from
working for our competitors if any of our key professional personnel leaves our
employment  and joins one of our  competitors  our business  could be adversely
affected

our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate
earnings in india

      during the first quarter of 2002  we made a strategic  decision to pursue
an international strategy that includes expanded  infrastructure  investments in
india and  geographic  expansion  in europe  and asia  as a  component  of this
strategy  we intend  to use 2002 and  future  indian  earnings  to  expand  our
operations  outside the united states instead of repatriating  those earnings to
the  united  states  accordingly   effective  january  1  2002  pursuant  to
accounting principles board opinion no 23 accounting for income taxesspecial
areas we no longer have to accrue taxes on all foreign earnings  recognized in
2002  and  subsequent  periods  as  these  earnings  are  now  considered  to be
indefinitely  reinvested outside the united states while we have no plans to do
so events may occur in the future that could effectively force us to change our
intent on repatriating  indian earnings  if we change our intent and repatriate
such earnings  we will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated
with  such  earnings  and pay  taxes at a  substantially  higher  rate  than the
effective  rate in 2003  these  increased  taxes could have a material  adverse
effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

our earnings may be adversely  affected if we change our accounting  policy with
respect to employee stock options

      stock options are an important component of compensation packages for most
of our mid and seniorlevel  employees  we currently do not deduct the expense
of employee stock option grants from our income  many companies  however  are
considering a change to their


                                       24


page


accounting  policies to record the value of stock options issued to employees as
an  expense  and  changes  in the  accounting  treatment  of stock  options  are
currently under  consideration by the financial  accounting  standards board and
other accounting  standardssetting  bodies  if we are required to or decide to
change our  accounting  policy with respect to the  treatment of employee  stock
option grants our earnings could be materially adversely affected

a significant portion of our projects are on a fixedprice basis  subjecting us
to the risks associated with cost overruns and operating cost inflation

      we contract to provide services either on a timeandmaterials basis or on
a fixedprice basis with fixedprice contracts accounting for approximately 25
and 26 of our  revenues  for the  years  ended  december  31  2002  and  2003
respectively we expect that an increasing number of our future projects will be
contracted  on a  fixedprice  basis  we bear  the risk of cost  overruns  and
operating  cost  inflation in connection  with projects  covered by  fixedprice
contracts  our failure to estimate  accurately  the resources and time required
for  a  fixedprice   project  or  our  failure  to  complete  our  contractual
obligations  within the time  frame  committed  could  have a material  adverse
effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

our business may suffer if we are unable to manage our rapid growth

      since we began providing software  development and maintenance services in
early 1994 our professional and support staff has increased from  approximately
25 to over approximately 9240 at december 31 2003 our anticipated growth will
continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources  in
particular  we will have to continue to increase  the number of our  personnel
particularly skilled technical marketing and management personnel and continue
to develop and  improve our  operational  financial  communications  and other
internal  systems  our inability to manage our anticipated  growth  effectively
could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and
financial condition

      as part of our growth strategy  we are expanding our operations in europe
and asia  we may not be able to compete  effectively  in these  markets and the
cost of entering these markets may be substantially  greater than we expect  if
we fail to compete  effectively  in the new markets we enter  or if the cost of
entering those markets is  substantially  greater than we expect  our business
results of operations and financial  condition could be adversely  affected  in
addition if we cannot compete effectively we may be required to reconsider our
strategy to invest in our international expansion plans and change our intent on
the repatriation of our earnings

we rely on a few customers for a large portion of our revenues

      approximately 35 38 and 36 of our revenues in years ended december 31
2001  and  2002  and  2003  respectively  were  generated  from  our top  five
customers approximately 101 of our revenues in the fiscal year ended december
31 2003 were generated  from jp morgan chase  the volume of work performed for
specific  customers is likely to vary from year to year and a major customer in
one year may not use our services in a subsequent  year  the loss of one of our
large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of
operations and financial condition

we generally do not have longterm contracts with our customers

      consistent  with  industry  practice  we  generally  do  not  enter  into
longterm  contracts  with our  customers  as a  result  we are  substantially
exposed to  volatility  in the market for our  services  and may not be able to
maintain our level of profitability  if we are unable to market our services on
terms we find  acceptable  our  financial  condition  and results of operations
could suffer materially

our operating results experience significant quarterly fluctuations

      we historically have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in our
revenues and results of operations  and expect these  fluctuations  to continue
among the factors causing these variations have been

      o     the number  timing  scope and contractual  terms of it development
            and maintenance projects in which we are engaged

      o     delays incurred in the performance of those projects

      o     the accuracy of estimates of resources and time required to complete
            ongoing projects and

      o     general economic conditions

      in  addition  our future  revenues  operating  results  and  margins may
fluctuate as a result of

      o     changes in pricing in response to  customer  demand and  competitive
            pressures

      o     the mix of onsite and offshore staffing

      o     the  ratio  of  fixedprice   contracts  versus   timeandmaterials
            contracts

      o     employee wage levels and utilization rates

      o     the timing of collection of accounts receivable and

      o     the breakdown of revenues by distribution channel

      a high percentage of our operating  expenses  particularly  personnel and
rent are relatively  fixed in advance of any particular  quarter  as a result
unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects or in employee
wage  levels  and  utilization  rates may cause  significant  variations  in our
operating  results in any particular  quarter  and could result in losses  any
significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations  any material
reduction in  utilization  rates for our  professional  staff or variance in the
onsite offshore staffing mix an unanticipated termination of a major project
a  customers  decision  not to pursue a new  project or  proceed to  succeeding
stages of a current project or the completion  during a quarter of several

major  customer  projects  could require us to pay  underutilized  employees and
could  therefore  have a material  adverse  effect on our  business  results of
operations and financial condition

      as a result of these factors  it is possible that in some future periods
our revenues and operating  results may be significantly  below the expectations
of public  market  analysts and  investors  in such an event  the price of our
common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected

we may not be able to sustain our current level of profitability

      our gross margin of 464 and 458 for the years ended  december 31 2002
and 2003  respectively  may  decline if we  experience  declines in demand and
pricing for our services in addition wages in india are increasing at a faster
rate than in the united  states  which could result in us  incurring  increased
costs for  technical  professionals  although  we have  been able to  partially
offset  pricing  pressures  and wage  increases  through our lowcost  operating
structure  there can be no assurance  that we will be able to continue to do so
in the future

liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business

      many  of  our  engagements  involve  projects  that  are  critical  to the
operations of our customers  businesses and provide benefits that are difficult
to quantify any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim
for substantial  damages against us  regardless of our  responsibility  for the
failure  although we attempt to limit by  contract  our  liability  for damages
arising from negligent acts  errors  mistakes or omissions in rendering our it
development  and  maintenance  services  there  can be no  assurance  that  any
contractual  limitations  on liability  will be  enforceable in all instances or
will otherwise  protect us from liability for damages  although we have general
liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors or omissions there
can be no assurance  that  coverage  will continue to be available on reasonable
terms or will be  available  in  sufficient  amounts  to cover one or more large
claims  or that the insurer will not disclaim  coverage as to any future claim
the  successful  assertion  of one or more large  claims  against us that exceed
available  insurance  coverage or changes in our insurance  policies  including
premium  increases  or  the  imposition  of  large  deductible  or  coinsurance
requirements  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of
operations and financial condition

we may have potential  liability  arising from the ims health  exchange offer in
the event  that we breach  any of our  representations  in  connection  with the
distribution agreement entered into with ims health

      we entered into a distribution agreement  dated january 7 2003 with ims
health the distribution  agreement  that provides among other things that
ims health and we will comply with  and not take any action during the relevant
time period that is inconsistent  with the  representations  made to and relied
upon by  mcdermott  will  emery  in  connection  with  rendering  its  opinion
regarding  us  federal  income tax  consequences  of the  exchange  offer  in
addition  pursuant to the  distribution  agreement  we agreed to indemnify ims
health  for any tax  liability  to which  they may be subject as a result of the
exchange  offer but only to the extent that such tax liability  resulted  solely
from a  breach  of the  representations  that we made and  were

relied upon by mcdermott  will  emery in connection with rendering its opinion
regarding the us  federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer if we
breach any of our representations in connection with the distribution agreement
the related  indemnification  liability could have a material  adverse effect on
our results of operations financial position and cash flows

we may be  subject  to legacy dun   bradstreet  liabilities  that could have an
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

      in 1996  the dun   bradstreet  corporation  now known as rh  donnelly
corporation  split itself into three separate  companies  the dun  bradstreet
corporation cognizant corporation and acnielsen corporation in connection with
the  splitup  transaction   the  dun    bradstreet   corporation   cognizant
corporation  renamed  nielsen media  research  of which cognizant  technology
solutions  corporation  was  once a  part  and ac  nielsen  corporation  now a
subsidiary of the dutch company vnu na entered into a distribution agreement
in the 1996 distribution agreement  each party assumed the liabilities relating
to the businesses  allocated to it and agreed to indemnify the other parties and
their subsidiaries against those liabilities and certain other matters the 1996
distribution  agreement also prohibited each party thereto from  distributing to
our  stockholders any business  allocated to it unless the distributed  business
delivered  undertakings agreeing to be jointly and severally liable to the other
parties  under  the  1996  distribution  agreement  for the  liabilities  of the
distributing  parent company under the 1996 distribution  agreement  ims health
made such  undertaking  when it was spun off by nielsen  media  research in 1998
and  accordingly  ims  health and  nielsen  media  research  are  jointly  and
severally  liable to rh  donnelly  and  acnielsen  for  cognizant  corporation
obligations under the terms of the 1996 distribution  agreement  ims health has
requested similar undertakings from cognizant  technology solutions  corporation
as a condition  to the  distribution  of our shares in the exchange  offer  ims
health is obligated to procure similar  undertakings  from cognizant  technology
solutions  corporation  to nielsen media research and synavant inc with respect
to  liabilities  allocated  to ims  health  in  connection  with  nielsen  media
researchs  spinoff of ims health and ims healths spinoff of synavant inc in
connection with the exchange offer  cognizant technology solutions  corporation
has given these undertakings and as a result  cognizant  technology  solutions
corporation  may be  subject  to claims  in the  future  in  relation  to legacy
liabilities

      one possible legacy liability arises from a pending antitrust action filed
by  information  resources  inc in 1996  which names as joint  defendants  all
parties to the 1996 distribution  agreement  information  resources  complaint
alleges  damages  in excess  of 350  million  which  amount it has asked to be
trebled plus punitive damages  acnielsen corporation agreed in connection with
the 1996 distribution agreement to assume any and all liabilities resulting from
the information resources claim to the extent that acnielsen remains financially
viable  in  connection  with vnus  acquisition  of acnielsen in 2001  vnu was
required to assume this liability and to be included with acnielsen for purposes
of determining the amount that can be paid by acnielsen in respect of any claim
ims  health  and  nielsen  media   research   inc   successors  to  cognizant
corporation  have agreed to share liabilities in excess of the amount acnielsen
is  required  to pay under the 1996  distribution  agreement  in respect of this
claim on a 5050  basis  with  the dun   bradstreet  corporation  subsequently
separated into the dun  bradstreet  corporation and moodys  corporation  ims
health and nielsen media research


                                       28

inc further agreed to share their portion of the liabilities in relation to the
information  resources  action  on a  7525  basis  subject  to  nielsen  media
research  incs  liability in respect of the information  resources action and
certain other contingent  liabilities being capped at 125 million  pursuant to
our undertaking cognizant technology solutions corporation could be held liable
for those amounts that vnu ims health  nielsen media  research  inc and the
dun  bradstreet  corporation  and their  successors  are unable or unwilling to
pay

      other claims have arisen in the past and may arise in the future under the
1996 distribution  agreement or the distribution  agreements relating to nielsen
media  researchs  spinoff of ims health and ims healths  spinoff of synavant
inc in which case cognizant  technology  solutions  corporation may be jointly
and  severally  liable  for any  losses  suffered  by the  parties  entitled  to
indemnification

      ims  health  has  agreed  to  indemnify  cognizant   technology  solutions
corporation for any and all liabilities that arise out of our undertakings to be
jointly and severally  liable for these  liabilities  but if for any reason ims
health does not perform on our  indemnification  obligation  these  liabilities
could have a material  adverse effect on our financial  condition and results of
operations

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights

      our future  success  will  depend in part on our  ability  to protect  our
intellectual  property  rights  we  presently  hold no  patents  or  registered
copyrights  and rely upon a  combination  of  copyright  and trade secret laws
nondisclosure and other contractual  arrangements and various security measures
to protect  our  intellectual  property  rights  india is a member of the berne
convention  and has agreed to recognize  protections  on  copyrights  conferred
under the laws of foreign countries including the laws of the united states we
believe  that laws  rules  regulations  and  treaties  in effect in the united
states  and  india  are  adequate  to  protect  us  from   misappropriation   or
unauthorized  use of our  copyrights  however  there can be no assurance  that
these laws will not change and in  particular  that the laws of india will not
change in ways that may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components
libraries  and  toolsets  from  india  to the  united  states  there  can be no
assurance  that the steps we have taken to  protect  our  intellectual  property
rights  will be adequate to deter  misappropriation  of any of our  intellectual
property  or  that  we  will be  able  to  detect  unauthorized  use  and  take
appropriate  steps to enforce our rights  unauthorized  use of our intellectual
property may result in  development  of  technology  products or services which
compete  with  our  products  and  unauthorized  parties  may  infringe  upon or
misappropriate our products services or proprietary information

      although we believe that our intellectual  property rights do not infringe
on the intellectual  property rights of any of our competitors or others  there
can be no assurance that infringement  claims will not be asserted against us in
the future  that assertion of infringement claims will not result in litigation
or that we would  prevail in that  litigation or be able to obtain a license for
the  use  of  any  infringed   intellectual  property  from  a  third  party  on
commercially   reasonable  terms  if  at  all  we  expect  that  the  risk  of
infringement  claims  against us will  increase if our  competitors  are able to
obtain patents for software  products and processes  any  infringement  claims
regardless of their outcome  could result in substantial  cost to us and divert
managements attention from our operations any infringement claim or litigation
against us

operations and financial condition

we may be unable to integrate acquired companies or technologies successfully

      we believe that  opportunities  exist in the fragmented it services market
to expand  our  business  through  selective  strategic  acquisitions  and joint
ventures we believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us
to expand our geographic presence  especially in the european market enter new
technology areas or expand our capacity  there can be no assurance that we will
identify  suitable  acquisition  candidates  available  for  sale at  reasonable
prices  consummate any acquisition or joint venture or  successfully  integrate
any  acquired   business  or  joint  venture  into  our   operations   further
acquisitions  and joint ventures  involve a number of special  risks  including
diversion  of   managements   attention   failure  to  retain  key  personnel
unanticipated  events or  circumstances  and legal  liabilities  some or all of
which  could  have a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business  results  of
operations and financial condition  we may finance any future acquisitions with
debt  financing  the  issuance of equity  securities  or a  combination  of the
foregoing  there can be no assurance  that we will be able to arrange  adequate
financing on  acceptable  terms  in addition  acquisitions  financed  with the
issuance of our equity securities could be dilutive

provisions in our charter  bylaws and stockholders rights plan and provisions
under delaware law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals

      provisions in our charter and bylaws  each as amended our stockholders
rights plan and delaware  general  corporate law dgcl may have the effect of
deterring  unsolicited  takeover  proposals or delaying or preventing changes in
our control or management  including  transactions in which  stockholders might
otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices in
addition  these  documents and provisions may limit the ability of stockholders
to approve  transactions  that they may deem to be in their best interests  our
board  of  directors  has  the   authority   without   further  action  by  the
stockholders  to fix the rights and preferences and issue shares of preferred
stock  our charter  provides for a classified  board of  directors  which will
prevent a change of control  of our board of  directors  at a single  meeting of
stockholders  the  elimination of our  stockholders  ability to act by written
consent  and to call a special  meeting  will delay  stockholder  actions  until
annual  meetings or until a special  meeting is called by our  chairman or chief
executive   officer  or  our  board  of  directors   the   supermajorityvoting
requirement  for  specified  amendments  to our  charter  and  bylaws  allows a
minority of our stockholders to block those  amendments  the dgcl also contains
provisions  preventing  stockholders from engaging in business combinations with
us subject to certain  exceptions  these provisions could also discourage bids
for our common stock at a premium as well as create a  depressive  effect on the
market price of the shares of our common stock

item 7 managements  discussion  and analysis of financial  condition and
        results of operations

overview


      we are a leading  provider  of custom it  services  related  to it design
development  integration  and maintenance  services  primarily for fortune 1000
companies located in the united states and europe our core competencies include
webcentric  applications  data  warehousing  componentbased  development and
legacy and  clientserver  systems  we provide it services  using an integrated
onsiteoffshore  business model this seamless  onsiteoffshore business model
combines  technical and account management teams located onsite at the customer
location  and  offshore at dedicated  development  centers  located in india and
ireland

      in 2003  our  revenue  increased  to 3682  million  compared  to 2291
million in 2002  net income  increased  to 574  million or 084 per  diluted
share in 2003 compared to 346 million or 054 per diluted share in 2002  our
revenue  growth  was  driven by  continued  strong  demand  for our  application
management and application development and integration services we believe this
trend will continue in 2004 we finished 2003 with 153 active  clients  compared
to 115 in 2002 we anticipate  that a significant  portion of our revenue growth
in 2004 will come from increased  penetration of existing clients  during 2003
88 of our revenue came from clients in north america  in 2004 we will look to
expand our  presence in northern  europe as we are  starting to see an increased
level of interest for offshore  services in that region  in 2003 our operating
margin decreased approximately 10 basis points to 196 from 197 in 2002 this
was consistent  with our targeted  operating  margin range of 19 to 20 of total
revenues

      at december 31 2003 we had cash and cash  equivalents of 1942 million
an increase  of 68  million  over the prior year  on  december  22  2003  we
announced building plans for three additional  fullyowned  development  centers
containing  over 600000  square feet of space in pune  chennai and  bangalore
total costs  related to this  program are  expected  to be  approximately  425
million  which we expect  to fund  from  current  operations  accordingly  we
believe  our  financial  condition  will remain  strong  in  addition  we will
continue to consider acquisitions of companies that can improve our capabilities
in certain market niches or geographic areas

critical accounting estimates and risks


      managements  discussion  and  analysis  of our  financial  condition  and
results of operations are based on our  consolidated  financial  statements that
have been prepared in accordance with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the united states of america  the preparation of these financial  statements
requires  management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the amounts
reported for assets and liabilities  including the  recoverability  of tangible
and intangible assets disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the
date of the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and
expenses  during the  reported  period  on an ongoing  basis  we evaluate our
estimates  the most significant  estimates relate to the recognition of revenue
and profits  based on the  percentage of  completion  method of  accounting  for
certain fixedbid contracts the allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes
valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets contingencies and litigation
we

                                       38

base our estimates on  historical  experience  and on various other  assumptions
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which
form the basis for  making  judgments  about the  carrying  values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual amounts
will differ  from the  estimates  used in the  preparation  of the  accompanying
consolidated  financial  statements  our  significant  accounting  policies are
described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

      we believe the following critical accounting policies require higher level
of management  judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated
financial statements

      revenue  recognition  revenues  related to our fixedprice  contracts are
recognized as the service is performed using the percentageofcompletion method
of  accounting  under which the total  contract  revenue  during the term of an
agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost
to date bears to the total estimated cost  estimates of total contract revenues
and  costs are  continuously  monitored  during  the term of the  contract  and
recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract  progresses
such  revisions  may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and
are reflected in the consolidated  financial  statements in the periods in which
they are first identified

      allowance  for doubtful  accounts  we maintain an allowance  for doubtful
accounts for estimated  losses  resulting from the inability of our customers to
make required  payments  the  allowance for doubtful  accounts is determined by
evaluating  the relative  creditworthiness  of each customer  based upon market
capitalization and other information including the aging of the receivables if
the financial  condition of our customers were to  deteriorate  resulting in an
impairment  of their  ability to make  payments  additional  allowances  may be
required

      income  taxes  determining  the  consolidated  provision  for  income tax
expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance if
any involves  judgment  as a global company  we are required to calculate and
provide for income  taxes in each of the  jurisdictions  where we operate  this
involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making
judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets tax exposures can
involve  complex  issues and may require an extended  period to resolve  in the
period  of  resolution  adjustments  may need to be  recorded  that  result  in
increases  or decreases to income  changes in the  geographic  mix or estimated
level of annual pretax income can also affect the overall  effective income tax
rate

      on an ongoing basis we evaluate whether a valuation  allowance is needed
to reduce our  deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to
be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent
and feasible tax planning  strategies  in assessing  the need for the  valuation
allowance  in the event we determine  that we will be able to realize  deferred
tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to
the deferred tax asset would  increase  income in the period such  determination
was made likewise  should we determine that we will not be able to realize all
or part of the net  deferred  tax  asset in the  future  an  adjustment  to the
deferred  tax asset  would be charged to income or equity if the  deferred  tax
asset is related to tax benefits  from stock option  benefits that have not been
realized in the period such determination was made

      our indian  subsidiary  cognizant india is an  exportoriented  company
which  under  the  indian  income  tax act of 1961  is  entitled  to claim tax
holidays  for a period of ten years with  respect to  cognizant  indias  export
profits  substantially  all of the earnings of cognizant india are attributable
to export profits and are therefore  currently entitled to a 100 exemption from
indian income tax  these tax holidays  will begin to expire in 2004 and  under
current law will be completely  phased out by march of 2009  prior to 2002 it
was managements intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from india to the
united states  accordingly we provided for deferred income taxes in the amount
of  approximately  286  million  on all such  undistributed  earnings  through
december  31  2001  during  the first  quarter  of 2002  we made a  strategic
decision  to  pursue  an   international   strategy   that   includes   expanded
infrastructure investments in india and geographic expansion in europe and asia
as a  component  of this  strategy  we  intend  to use 2002 and  future  indian
earnings  to  expand  operations   outside  of  the  united  states  instead  of
repatriating these earnings to the united states accordingly effective january
1 2002  pursuant to accounting  principles  board opinion no 23 we no longer
accrue  incremental  us taxes on all foreign  earnings  recognized in 2002 and
subsequent   periods  as  these  earnings  are  considered  to  be  indefinitely
reinvested  outside of the united states as of december 31 2003 the amount of
unrepatriated  indian  earnings upon which no  incremental  us taxes have been
recorded is  approximately  795  million  while we have no plans to do so if
such  earnings  are  repatriated  in the  future or are no  longer  deemed to be
indefinitely  reinvested   we  will  accrue  the  applicable  amount  of  taxes
associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially  higher rate than
the effective  rate in 2003  due to the various  methods by which such earnings
could be repatriated in the future it is not currently practicable to determine
the amount of  applicable  taxes that would  result  from such  repatriation  or
whether the amount of previously  accrued deferred taxes on earnings  recognized
prior to 2002 will  require  adjustment

      effective  april 1 2003  the  government of india passed various tax law
changes which affected the way in which our earnings are taxed in india the tax
exemption  for export  earnings  was  restored to 100 from 90  the surtax was
reduced  decreasing the indian effective rate from 3675 to 35875 for income
that is subject to tax the corporate  level tax on the payment of dividends was
restored and the withholding tax on dividends was repealed

      goodwill  we evaluate  goodwill for impairment at least  annually  or as
circumstances  warrant  when determining the fair value of our reporting units
we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows any
adverse changes in key  assumptions  about our businesses and their prospects or
an adverse  change in market  conditions may cause a change in the estimation of
fair value and could result in an  impairment  charge  as of december 31 2003
our goodwill balance was approximately 45 million

      longlived  assets  in accordance with statement of financial  accounting
standards  sfas  no  144  accounting  for the  impairment  or disposal of
longlived  assets  which  was  adopted  in 2002  we  review  for  impairment
longlived  assets  and  certain  identifiable  intangibles  whenever  events or
changes in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable in general we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of
undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such
asset  the  measurement  for such an impairment  loss is then based on the fair
value of the asset if such assets were determined to be impaired it could have
a material  adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial

year ended december 31 2003 compared to year ended december 31 2002

      revenue revenue increased by 607 or approximately 1391 million from
approximately  2291  million  during 2002 to  approximately  3682 million in
2003  this increase  resulted  primarily  from an increase in both  application
management and development services and revenue generated from acquisitions we
provide services through  timeandmaterials  and fixedbid contracts  over the
course of the last three years  revenues  recognized under fixedbid  contracts
have  increased  as a percent of total  revenues  from 239 in 2001 to 246 in
2002 and 259 in 2003  this  increase is  attributable  primarily to increased
demand


                                       41

due to our customers preferring to specifically  quantify project costs prior to
entering into contracts

      during 2003  one customer  jp morgan  chase  accounted for 101 of our
revenues  and in 2002  no single  customer  accounted  for greater than 10 of
revenues

      gross  profit  our cost of  revenues  consists  primarily  of the cost of
salaries  payroll  taxes  benefits   immigration  and  travel  for  technical
personnel  and the cost of  sales  commissions  related  to  revenues  cost of
revenues increased by 628 or approximately 770 million  from approximately
1227 million during 2002 to approximately 1997 million in 2003 the increase
was due primarily to higher  compensation  costs  resulting from the increase in
the number of our technical  professionals from approximately 5600 employees at
december 31 2002 to  approximately  8500  employees at december 31 2003  the
increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand
for our services and employees acquired through  acquisitions  our gross profit
increased by 584 or approximately  621 million  from approximately  1064
million during 2002 to  approximately  1685 million during 2003  gross profit
margin  decreased  from 464 of  revenues  during  2002 to 458 of revenues in
2003 the decrease in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the
appreciation of the indian rupee versus the us dollar

      selling  general  and  administrative  expenses   selling  general  and
administrative  expenses  consist  primarily  of  salaries  employee  benefits
travel  promotion  communications  management  finance  administrative  and
occupancy  costs  selling  general  and  administrative  expenses   including
depreciation  and  amortization  increased  by 572  or  approximately  350
million  from  approximately  612 million during 2002 to approximately  962
million during 2003 and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately
267 to 261 respectively  the increase in such expenses in absolute dollars
was due  primarily  to  expenses  incurred  to expand  our  sales and  marketing
activities  and  increased  infrastructure  expenses to support our growth  the
decrease in such  expenses as a percentage  of revenue was due  primarily to the
leverage  achieved from increased  revenues that have resulted from our expanded
sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years

      income  from  operations  income  from  operations  increased  600  or
approximately  271 million  from  approximately  452 million during 2002 to
approximately  723 million during 2003  representing  approximately 197 and
196 of  revenues  respectively  the  decrease  in  operating  margin was due
primarily to the lower gross margin  partially offset by our ability to leverage
prior sales and marketing investments

      other incomeexpense  other incomeexpense consists primarily of interest
income and  splitoff  costs  related to the exchange  offer in which ims health
offered to its stockholders to exchange its holdings of our class b common stock
for shares of ims health interest income increased by approximately 177 from
approximately  18 million  during 2002 to  approximately  21 million  during
2003 the increase in such interest  income was  attributable to higher invested
cash balances  partially  offset by lower global  interest  rates we recognized

an effective  tax rate of 234 in 2002 and 206 in 2003  the lower  effective
tax rate is a result of a reduction  in the surtax in india and the  restoration
of the 100 exemption on export  earnings both of which were effective  april 1
2003 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements

      net income net income increased from approximately  346 million in 2002
to approximately  574 million in 2003  representing  approximately  151 and
156 as a percentage of revenues  respectively  the higher percentage in 2003
is primarily  attributed  to the decrease in the  effective  tax rate  discussed
above

      revenue  revenue increased by 289 or approximately 513 million from
approximately  1778  million  during 2001 to  approximately  2291 million in
2002  this  increase  resulted   primarily  from  an  increase  in  application
management and  application  development and  integration  services  we provide
services through  timeandmaterials and fixedbid contracts over the course of
the  last  three  years  revenues  recognized  under  fixedbid  contracts  have
increased as a percent of total  revenues from 151 in 2000 to 239 in 2001 to

for greater than 10 of revenues

      gross  profit  our cost of  revenues  consists  primarily  of the cost of
salaries  payroll  taxes  benefits   immigration  and  travel  for  technical
personnel  and the cost of sales commissions  related to revenues  our cost of
revenues increased by 351 or approximately 319 million  from approximately
908 million during 2001 to approximately  1227 million in 2002 the increase
was due  primarily  to the  increased  cost  resulting  from the increase in the
number of our technical  professionals  from  approximately  3470  employees at
december 31 2001 to  approximately  5600  employees at december 31 2002  the
increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand
for our services and employees acquired through  acquisitions  our gross profit
increased by 224 or approximately  195 million  from  approximately  869
million during 2001 to  approximately  1064 million during 2002  gross profit
margin  decreased  from 489 of  revenues  during  2001 to 464 of revenues in
2002  the decrease in such gross profit  margin was primarily  attributable  to
higher  incentive  compensation  costs in 2002 as compared  to 2001  due to our
significantly increased performance

incurred  to  expand  our  sales  and   marketing   activities   and   increased
infrastructure  expenses to support our growth the decrease in such expenses as
a percentage of revenue was due  primarily to the  increased  revenues that have
resulted  from our expanded  sales and  marketing  activities in the current and
prior years

      income  from  operations  income  from  operations  increased  269  or
approximately  96 million  from  approximately  356 million  during 2001 to
approximately  452 million during 2002  representing  approximately 200 and
197 of  revenues  respectively  the  decrease  in  operating  margin was due
primarily to higher incentive compensation costs in 2002 as compared to 2001

income offset  by foreign currency  exchange losses and in 2001 an impairment
loss on an  investment  and in 2002  splitoff  costs  related to the exchange
offer in which ims  health has  offered  to its  stockholders  to  exchange  its

approximately   277   from   approximately   25  million   during  2001  to
approximately 18 million during 2002 the decrease in such interest income was
attributable  primarily to lower  interest  rates  offset  in part  by higher
operating cash balances  we recognized a net foreign currency  exchange loss of
approximately 767000 during 2001 compared to an exchange loss of approximately
235000  during 2002 as a result of the effect of changing  exchange  rates on
our transactions  we recognized an impairment loss on our investment in questra
corporation  questra of approximately 20 million during the fourth quarter
of 2001 in  recognition  of an  other  than  temporary  decline  in  value  the
impairment loss was based upon an implied  valuation of questra as a result of a
recent new round of venture  capital  funding  in which our equity  interest  in
questra  was  substantially  diluted  and  investors  other  than us  received
preferential  liquidation  rights the impairment loss net of tax benefit  was
approximately 12 million or 002 per diluted share we recognized  splitoff
costs of approximately 17 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to the
exchange offer

an effective  tax rate of 374 in 2001 and 234 in 2002  the lower  effective
tax rate reflects our change in our intention regarding the repatriation of 2002
and future  earnings from our  subsidiary  in india  as well as a change in the
manner in which  repatriated  earnings  are  taxed in india  see note 7 to the
consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources


      at december 31 2003 we had cash and cash  equivalents  of  approximately
1942  million  we have used  and plan to use such cash for i expansion of
existing operations  including our offshore software development centers  ii
continued  development of new service  lines  iii  possible  acquisitions  of
related businesses  iv formation of joint ventures and v general corporate
purposes including working capital as of december 31 2003 and 2002 we had no
significant third party debt we had working capital of approximately 2159 and
1343 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively  accordingly  we do
not anticipate any nearterm liquidity issues

      net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 799 million
567 million and 321 million for the years ended december 31 2003  2002 and
2001  respectively  the  increase  in 2003 as  compared  to the prior  year is
primarily  attributed  to  the  increase  in  our  net  income  trade  accounts
receivable  increased from  approximately  225 million at december 31 2001 to
approximately  367  million at december  31 2002 and to  approximately  523
million at december  31  2003  unbilled  accounts  receivable  decreased  from

2003 the increase in trade accounts receivable during 2003 was due primarily to
increased revenue the increase in unbilled accounts receivable in 2003 compared
to the prior year was due primarily to revenue  growth and increased  percentage
of revenue coming from fixedprice contracts we monitor turnover aging and the
collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are
prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff at december 31
2003  our  days  sales  outstanding   including  unbilled  receivables   was

355 million and 150 million for the years ended december 31 2003  2002 and
2001 respectively the increase in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily reflects our
increased   investment   in  property  and  equipment  to  expand  our  offshore
development  infrastructure offset in part by lower spending for acquisitions in
2003  the increase in 2002  compared to 2001  primarily  reflects our increased
purchases  of  property  and  equipment  to  expand  our  offshore   development
infrastructure   and  the   acquisitions   of  intangible   assets   related  to
unitedhealthcare ireland limited and silverline  technologies  inc see note 4

      our financing activities provided net cash of approximately 218 million
200 million  and 60 million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and
2001 respectively  the increase in each year was primarily related to a higher
level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases
of stock partially offset by payment of splitoff costs in 2003

      we believe  that our  available  funds and the cash flows  expected  to be
generated  from  operations  will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned
operations and needs for at least

      our most  significant  costs are the salaries and related benefits for our
programming  staff and other  professionals  competition  in india  the united
states and europe for professionals  with advanced technical skills necessary to
perform our  services  offered  have caused  wages to increase at a rate greater
than the general rate of inflation  as with other it service providers we must
adequately anticipate wage increases particularly on our fixedprice contracts
there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through
increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the united states and

industry background

     many companies today face intense competitive pressure and rapidly changing
market   dynamics   in  addition   the   evolution  of   technology   and  the
commercialization  of the internet have  contributed  to the rapid change in the
business  environment  in  response to these  challenges  many  companies  are
focused on improving productivity increasing service levels lowering costs and
accelerating  delivery  times  in order to achieve  these goals  companies are
implementing a broad range of technologies such as

     o    ebusiness and ecommerce applications

     o    data warehousing

     o    customer and supply chain management and

     o    middlewareenterprise application integration

     these technologies facilitate faster more responsive  lowercost business
operations  however  their development  integration and ongoing  maintenance
present  major   challenges  and  require  a  large  number  of  highly  skilled
professionals trained in many diverse technologies  in addition companies also
require  additional  technical  resources to maintain  enhance and  reengineer
their core legacy it systems and to address  application  maintenance  projects
increasingly  companies are relying on custom it solutions  providers  such as
cognizant to provide these services

     in order to respond  effectively  to a changing  and  challenging  business
environment  it  departments of many  companies  have focused  increasingly  on
improving  returns  on it  investments  lowering  costs  and  accelerating  the
delivery of new systems and solutions  to accomplish these objectives  many it
departments have shifted all or a portion of their it

development   integration  and  maintenance  requirements  to  outside  service
providers  this outsourcing  enables companies to eliminate or reduce the large
inhouse it staffs  otherwise  required  to  evaluate  implement  and manage it
initiatives  thereby  reducing the present and future  investments  required to
maintain and  continually  train a technical  staff in order to achieve greater
cost savings and to increase delivery times  companies are increasingly turning
to it services providers operating with onsiteoffshore business models

     global  demand  for high  quality  lower  cost it  services  from  outside
providers has created a significant  opportunity for it service  providers which
can successfully  leverage the benefits of and address the challenges in using
an offshore  talent pool  the effective  use of offshore  personnel can offer a
variety of benefits  including lower costs faster delivery of new it solutions
and more flexible scheduling certain developing countries  particularly india
have a large talent pool of highly qualified  technical  professionals  that can
provide  high  quality  it  services  at a lower  cost  india is a leader in it
services and is regarded as having one of the largest  pools of it talent in the
world  historically  it  service  providers  have used  offshore  labor  pools
primarily to  supplement  the internal  staffing  needs of  customers  however
evolving  customer  demands  have led to the  increasing  acceptance  and use of
offshore  resources for higher  valueadded  services  these  services  include
application design development  integration and maintenance  indias services
and  software  exports  have grown from 52  billion  for the fiscal year ended
march 31 2001 to 60  billion for the fiscal  year ended  march 31  2002  as
estimated  by the  national  association  of  software  and  services  companies
nasscom  in india  converted  from rupees to us  dollars at the  respective
yearend noonbuying rates announced by the new york federal reserve bank this
represents a 15 growth over the prior  period  nasscom has  projected  indias
services and software exports to grow at a rate of approximately  22 for fiscal
year 200203

     using an offshore  workforce  to provide  valueadded  services  presents a
number of challenges to it service  providers  the offshore  implementation  of
valueadded  it services  requires  that it service  providers  continually  and
effectively  attract  train and  retain  highly  skilled  software  development
professionals  with the advanced  technical  skills  necessary to keep pace with
continuing  changes in information  technology  evolving industry standards and
changing customer preferences these skills are necessary to design develop and
deploy highquality  technology solutions in a costeffective and timely manner
in addition  it service  providers must have the  methodologies  processes and
communications  capabilities  to enable  offshore  workforces to be successfully
integrated  with  onsite  personnel  service  providers  must also have strong
research  and  development  capabilities   technology  competency  centers  and
relationship management skills in order to compete effectively

the cognizant solution

     cognizant   believes  that  it  has   developed  an  effective   integrated
onsiteoffshore business model and that this business model will be a critical

customers at costs  significantly  lower than services  sourced  exclusively  in
developed   countries   cognizants   strengths   which   cognizant   believes
differentiate it from other it service providers include the following

proprietary   methodologies  for  integrating  onsite  and  offshore  teams  to
facilitate  costeffective  ontime  delivery of highquality  projects  these
methodologies  comprise  cognizants  proprietary  qview  software  engineering
process  which is available to all onsite and offshore programmers  cognizant
uses this iso 9000 certified  process to define and implement  projects from the
design  development  and  deployment  stages  through to  ongoing  application
maintenance  for most projects qview is used as part of an initial assessment
that allows cognizant to define the scope and risks of the project and subdivide
the project into smaller  phases with  frequent  deliverables  and feedback from
customers  cognizant  also uses its  qview  process to  detect  mitigate  and
correct possible quality defects and to establish appropriate  contingencies for
each  project  in  order  to  ensure  implementation  of the  quality  process
cognizant  assigns  a quality  facilitator  to each  project  who  reports  to a
centralized  quality  assurance  and  software  engineering  group  this  group
performs on a sample basis quality audits deliverables verifications metrics
collection and analysis  which are used to improve processes and methodologies
these processes and methodologies  have proven to be scalable  as cognizant has
significantly  increased the number of offshore development  centers  customers
and projects in addition all of cognizants principal development centers have
been assessed by kpmg at level 5 the highest possible rating of the capability
maturity  model  of  the  software  engineering  institute  at  carnegie  mellon

     welldeveloped infrastructure cognizants extensive facilities technology
and  communications  infrastructure  facilitate the seamless  integration of its
onsite and offshore workforces this is accomplished by permitting team members
in different locations to access common project information and to work directly
on customer projects this infrastructure allows for

          o    rapid completion of projects

          o    highest level of quality

          o    offpeak use of customers technological resources and

          o    realtime  access to project  information by the onsite  account
               manager or the customer

     international time differences enable cognizants offshore teams located in
india to access a customers  computing  facilities located in the united states
and europe  during  offpeak  hours  this  ability to perform  services  during
offpeak hours enables  cognizant to complete projects more rapidly and does not
require cognizants customers to invest in duplicative hardware and software in
addition  for large  projects  with short  time  frames  cognizants  offshore
facilities  allow for  parallel  processing  of  various  development  phases to
accelerate  delivery  time  in addition  cognizant  can deliver  services more
rapidly than some competitors without an offshore labor pool because cognizants
lower labor costs enable it to  costeffectively  assign more professionals to a
project

amendments to cognizants certificate of incorporation

     in  connection  with the  exchange  offer  ims  health  executed a written
consent  in lieu of a special  stockholders  meeting to  approve  amendments  to
cognizants  certificate of incorporation that included the provisions described
below and became  effective  following  consummation of the exchange offer  the
material  terms  of  these   amendments  are  summarized   below  for  complete
information  you  should  read the full  text of the  restated  certificate  of
incorporation  which has been filed with the sec as an exhibit to the companys
current report of form 8k dated february 13 2003 the restated  certificate of
incorporation is incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k

effects of the amendments

     the  exchange  offer  may make it  easier  for a single  person or group of
related  persons  to gain  control  over  cognizant  because  ims  health  held
approximately  55  of  cognizants   outstanding  common  stock   constituting
approximately  93 of the combined voting power of cognizants  common stock it
was  impossible  for a person other than ims health to gain control of cognizant
without ims healths  consent  following the exchange offer  however  the new
holders of cognizants common stock have the ability to elect cognizants entire
board of directors accordingly a person or group of related persons could gain
control of cognizant by acquiring a majority of the outstanding common stock or
the votes  represented by those shares  in addition  the control position that
ims health had in matters voted on by cognizant  stockholders were eliminated as
a  result  of  the  exchange   offer   eliminating  ims  health  as  holder  of
approximately  55  of  cognizants   outstanding  common  stock   constituting
approximately 93 of the combined voting power of cognizants common stock as a
result of the exchange  offer could  increase  cognizants  vulnerability  to an
unsolicited takeover proposal the charter amendments  together with the bylaw
amendments and cognizants stockholders rights plan will make it more difficult
for a potential  acquirer of cognizant  to take  advantage  of  cognizants  new
capital  structure in acquiring  cognizant by means of a transaction that is not
negotiated with cognizants board of directors

     classified board

     cognizants  certificate  of  incorporation  was  amended to provide  for a

          stockholders to be held following that meeting

     at each annual meeting  following  cognizants  next annual  meeting  only
directors  of the class  whose term is  expiring  that year will be  required to
stand for  election  and upon  election  each  director will serve a threeyear
term any newly created directorship that results from an increase in the number
of directors  and any vacancy  occurring in the board of directors can be filled
only by a  majority  of the  directors  then in  office  no change may have the
effect of removing any director from office  upon any change in the  authorized
number of directors  the total number of directors  will be allocated as evenly
as possible among the three classes provided that the term of office may not be
shortened for any incumbent director any director elected to fill a vacancy not
resulting  from an  increase  in the  number  of  directors  will  have the same
remaining term as that of his or her predecessor any director elected to fill a
newly created  directorship  resulting from an increase in the size of any class
will have the same remaining term as the other directors of that class

     cognizants  certificate  of  incorporation  provides that directors can be
removed  only by the  affirmative  vote of at least 80 in  voting  power of all
outstanding  shares of cognizant  common stock entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors  in addition  following  cognizants next annual meeting
and the  implementation  of the classified board of directors  directors may be
removed only for cause

     board size

number of  cognizants  directors will be not less than three and that the exact
number of directors will be fixed from time to time by a majority of cognizants
board of  directors  the board of directors set the number of directors at six
which was effective immediately following consummation of the exchange offer

     stockholders may not act by written consent

     unless  otherwise  provided in a companys  certificate  of  incorporation
delaware  law  permits  any  action   required  or  permitted  to  be  taken  by
stockholders  of a company at a meeting to be taken  without  notice  without a
meeting and without a stockholder  vote if a written  consent  setting forth the
action to be taken is  signed by the  holders  of  shares of  outstanding  stock
having the  requisite  number of votes that would be necessary to authorize  the
action at a meeting of  stockholders  at which all shares  entitled to vote were
present and voted cognizants restated

that a special  meeting  of the  stockholders  may be  called  only by the chief
executive officer of cognizant or cognizants board of directors and to require
that business transacted at any special meeting be limited to the purpose stated
in the notice of the meeting

     supermajority approval requirements

     prior to the exchange offer  in addition to approval by cognizants  board
of  directors  the  approval of the  holders of a majority  in voting  power of
cognizants  outstanding  shares of stock entitled to vote was required to amend
any provision of cognizants certificate of incorporation  delaware law permits
a company to include provisions in its certificate of incorporation that require
a greater vote than the vote otherwise required by law for any corporate action

was  amended to require the  affirmative  vote of the holders of at least 80 in
voting power of the outstanding  shares of cognizant  entitled to vote generally
in the  election of  directors  voting  together as a single  class  to amend
alter change add to or repeal specified provisions of cognizants  certificate
of incorporation and any provision of the bylaws the provisions in cognizants

          certificate of incorporation or the bylaws

attempting to obtain  control of cognizant by making it more  difficult to amend
cognizants bylaws  whether to eliminate provisions that have an antitakeover
effect or those that  protect  the  interests  of  minority  stockholders  this
supermajority voting amendment permits a minority of cognizants stockholders to
block an attempt by its stockholders to amend or repeal its bylaws

stockholders rights plan

     in connection  with the completion of the exchange  offer on march 5 2003
cognizants  board  of  directors  adopted  a  stockholders  rights  plan  the
stockholders rights plan did not require stockholder approval

     the  stockholders   rights  plan  provides  that  holders  of  cognizants
outstanding  class a or  class b common  stock  will  receive  in the form of a
dividend  a right to purchase  11000 of a share of a newly  created  series of
preferred  stock  which  will  be  the  economic  equivalent  of one  share  of
cognizants  common stock the rights will become  exercisable on the earlier of
1 the tenth day following the public  announcement  that a person or group has
acquired  beneficial  ownership of 15 or more of cognizants total voting power
represented  by the class a common  stock  and class b common  stock and 2 the
tenth business day or such later date as may be determined by cognizants board

time a person  acquires more than 15 of the voting power if any person were to
do so each holder of a right other than rights held by the  acquiring  person
which  would  become  void  will  receive  upon  exercise  of the right at the
thencurrent  exercise price shares of cognizants common stock having a market
value on that date of twice the exercise price of the right  commonly  referred
to as a flipin  right if the flipin  right were  exercised  the  acquiring
persons voting and economic interest in cognizant would be dramatically diluted
by the issuance by  cognizant of large  numbers of its shares of common stock to
its current stockholders other than the acquiring person at a reduced price if
after  any  person  acquired  shares of  cognizants  outstanding  common  stock
representing  more than 15 of the voting  power  cognizant  were acquired in a
business  consolidation or 50 or more of its assets or earning power were sold
each holder of a right other than rights held by the  acquiring  person  which
would become void will receive  upon exercise of the right at the thencurrent
exercise  price  shares of the  acquirer  having a market value on that date of
twice the  exercise  price of the right  commonly  referred to as a  flipover
right  this  would  cause  significant  dilution  to the  acquirers  existing
stockholders

     any person owning in excess of 15 of cognizants  voting power on the date
of the  adoption  of the  plan or as a result  of the  exchange  offer  will not
trigger these rights so long as that person does not acquire additional shares

     revenue  recognition  the companys  services are entered into on either a
timeandmaterials  or fixedprice basis  revenues related to timeandmaterial
contracts  are  recognized  as the  service is  performed  revenues  related to
fixedprice contracts that provide for application  development services or that
provide for a combination of application  development and application management
services   are   recognized   as   the   service   is   performed    using   the
percentageofcompletion  method of  accounting  under which the sales value of
performance  is recognized on the basis of the percentage  that each  contracts
cost to date bears to the total estimated cost revenues related to fixedpriced
contracts  that  provided  solely  for  application   management   services  are
recognized on a straightline  basis or as services are rendered or transactions
processed in accordance with contract  terms  expenses are recorded as incurred
over the contract period

     in november 2002 the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus
in eitf 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the consensus
which is effective for contracts  entered into in fiscal periods beginning after
june  15  2003  requires  that  a  company  evaluate  all  deliverables  in an
arrangement to determine  whether they  represent  separate units of accounting
that  evaluation  must be performed at the inception of the  arrangement  and as
each item in the arrangement is delivered  arrangement  consideration should be
then allocated  among the separate  units of accounting  based on their relative
fair values  eitf 0021  indicates  that the best evidence of fair value is the
price of a deliverable  when it is regularly sold on a standalone  basis  fair
value evidence often consists of entityspecific  or  vendorspecific  objective
evidence of fair value

     the company  enters into  contracts  that could be considered  arrangements
with multiple  deliverables  these contracts are primarily  longterm fixedbid
contracts that provide both application  maintenance and application development
services  as  indicated  above  and in  note 2 to  the  consolidated  financial
statements  the  company  accounts  for  such  contracts  using  percentage  of
completion  accounting  the company is  currently  evaluating  the  prospective
impact of eitf 0021 on the companys results of operations related to contracts
entered into after june 15 2003

either  unbilled or deferred  revenue  estimates are subject to adjustment as a
project  progresses  to  reflect  changes  in  expected  completion  costs  the
cumulative  impact of any revision in  estimates  is reflected in the  financial
reporting  period  in  which  the  change  in  estimate  becomes  known  and any
anticipated  losses on  contracts  are  recognized  immediately  a reserve  for
warranty provisions under such contracts  which generally exist for ninety days
past contract completion is estimated and accrued during the contract period

     revenues related to services  performed  without a signed agreement or work
order are not recognized until there is evidence of an arrangement such as when
agreements  or work orders are signed or payment is  received  however the cost
related to the performance of such work is recognized in the period the services
are  rendered  such  revenue  is  recognized  when  and  if  evidence  of  an
arrangement is obtained

     foreign currency  translation  the assets and liabilities of the companys
canadian and european  subsidiaries  are translated into us dollars from local
currencies at current  exchange  rates and revenues and expenses are  translated
from  local   currencies  at  average  monthly  exchange  rates  the  resulting
translation  adjustments are recorded in a separate  component of  stockholders
equity  for the companys  indian  subsidiary  cts  india  the  functional
currency is the us  dollar  since its sales are made  primarily in the united
states  the sales price is  predominantly  in us  dollars and there is a high
volume of  intercompany  transactions  denominated in us  dollars  between cts
india  and  its  us  affiliates   nonmonetary  assets  and  liabilities  are
translated at historical  exchange rates  while monetary assets and liabilities
are translated at current  exchange rates the resulting gain loss is included
in other income

     allowance  for doubtful  accounts  the company  maintains  allowances  for
doubtful  accounts for  estimated  losses  resulting  from the  inability of its
customers to make required  payments  the  allowance  for doubtful  accounts is
determined by evaluating the relative  creditworthiness  of each customer based
upon market  capitalization  and other  information  including the aging of the
receivables  if the  financial  condition of the  companys  customers  were to
deteriorate  resulting  in an  impairment  of their  ability to make  payments
additional allowances may be required

     income  taxes  the  company  records a valuation  allowance  to reduce its
deferred  tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be  realized
while the company has considered  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and
feasible  tax  planning  strategies  in  assessing  the need  for the  valuation
allowance  in the event the company were to determine  that it would be able to
realize  its  deferred  tax assets in the  future in excess of its net  recorded
amount  an  adjustment to the deferred tax asset would  increase  income in the
period such determination was made likewise  should the company determine that
it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the
future  an  adjustment  to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or
equity if the deferred  tax asset is related to tax benefits  from stock option
benefits that have not been realized in the period such determination was made

     cognizants  indian subsidiary  cts india is an exportoriented  company
which under the indian income tax act of 1961 is entitled to claim tax holidays
for a period of ten years with respect to its export profits  substantially all
of the  earnings  of cts  india  are  attributable  to  export  profits  and are
therefore  currently  entitled to a 90 exemption  from indian income tax

                                       31

these tax  holidays  will begin to expire in 2004 and under  current law will be
completely  phased  out by  march of 2009  prior to 2002  it was  managements
intent to repatriate all  accumulated  earnings from india to the united states
accordingly  cognizant  has  provided  deferred  income  taxes in the amount of
approximately 249 million on all such undistributed  earnings through december
31 2001 during the first quarter of 2002  cognizant made a strategic decision
to  pursue an  international  strategy  that  includes  expanded  infrastructure
investments in india and geographic expansion in europe and asia as a component
of this strategy  cognizant  intends to use 2002 and future indian  earnings to
expand  operations  outside of the united states instead of  repatriating  these
earnings to the united states accordingly  effective january 1 2002 pursuant
to accounting  principles  bulletin 23 cognizant will no longer accrue taxes on
the repatriation of earnings  recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these
earnings are  considered  to be  indefinitely  reinvested  outside of the united
states as of december 31 2002 the amount of unrepatriated earnings upon which
no provision for taxation has been recorded is approximately  301 million  if
such  earnings  are  repatriated  in the future  or are no longer  deemed to be
indefinitely  reinvested  cognizant will accrue the applicable  amount of taxes
associated with such earnings due to the various methods by which such earnings
could be repatriated in the future it is not currently practicable to determine
the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation

     this  change  in  intent  as well  as a  change  in the  manner  in  which
repatriated earnings are taxed in india  resulted in an estimated effective tax
rate for the year ended  december  31 2002 of 234  this rate  compares to an
effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2001 of 374

     effective  april 1 2002  the  government of india passed  various tax law
changes  which  affected  the way in which the  companys  earnings are taxed in
india  the tax  exemption  for export  earnings was reduced from 100 to 90 a
surtax was imposed increasing the effective rate from 357 to 3675 for income
that is subject to tax and the corporate  level tax on the payment of dividends
was replaced with a withholding tax on dividends

     cognizants  cash   requirements   could  change  over  time  which  could
effectively  force it to change its intent on repatriating  indian earnings  if
cognizants  earnings are intended to be  repatriated  in the future  or are no
longer reinvested  outside the united states  cognizant will have to accrue the
applicable  amount of taxes  associated  with such  earnings  and pay taxes at a
substantially higher rate than the effective rate in 2002 these increased taxes
could  have a  material  adverse  effect on  cognizants  business  results  of
operations and financial condition as well as cash flows to fund such taxes in
addition  cognizant may need to accelerate the payment of significant  deferred
taxes which would have a significant impact on its cash position

     goodwill and other intangibles  prior to 2002 goodwill  which related to
the  acquisition  of  the  former  minority  interest  in the  companys  indian
subsidiary  was amortized  using the straightline basis over a period of seven
years  effective  january 1 2002  in accordance  with  statement of financial
accounting  standards  sfas no 142 goodwill and other  intangible  assets
fas 142 the company is no longer amortizing its remaining goodwill balance
however  at each balance  date  the company does  evaluate  goodwill and other
intangible assets for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant

     longlived  assets  in accordance  with statement of financial  accounting
standards  sfas  no  144  accounting  for the  impairment  or disposal of
longlived  assets  which  was  adopted  in  2002  the  company  reviews  for
impairment  longlived  assets and  certain  identifiable  intangibles  whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be  recoverable  in general  the company will  recognize an impairment
loss when the sum of  undiscounted  expected  future cash flows is less than the
carrying  amount of such assets  the measurement for such an impairment loss is
then based on the fair value of the asset

     revenue  revenue increased by 289 or approximately 513 million  from
approximately  1778  million  during 2001 to  approximately  2291 million in
2002  this  increase  resulted   primarily  from  an  increase  in  application
management and application  development and  integration  services  the company
provides  services  through time and materials  tm and fixedbid contracts
over the course of the last three  years  revenues  recognized  under  fixedbid
contracts  have  increased as a percent of total  revenues from 151 in 2000 to
239 in 2001 and 246 in 2002  this  increase is  attributable  primarily  to
increased demand for such services due to the customers ability to specifically
quantify project costs prior to entering into contracts

     sales to  related  parties  on a  yearoveryear  basis  were 106 in 2001
compared to 89 in 2002  for statement of operations  purposes  revenues from
related parties only include revenues  recognized during the period in which the
related party was  affiliated  with the company  during 2001 and 2002 no third
party accounted for greater than 10 of revenues

     gross profit the companys cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost
of salaries  payroll  taxes  benefits  immigration  and travel for  technical

cost of revenues  increased  by 351  or  approximately  319  million  from
approximately 908 million during 2001 to approximately 1227 million in 2002
the increase was due primarily to the increased cost resulting from the increase
in the number of the companys technical  professionals from approximately 3470
employees at december 31 2001 to over 6100 employees at december 31 2002 the
increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand
for the companys services and on employees acquired through acquisitions  see
note 2 to the  consolidated  financial  statements  the companys gross profit
increased by 224 or approximately  195 million  from  approximately  869
million during 2001 to  approximately  1064 million during 2002  gross profit
margin  decreased  from 489 of  revenues  during  2001 to 464 of revenues in
2002  the decrease in such gross profit  margin was primarily  attributable  to
higher  incentive  compensation  costs in 2002 as compared  to 2001  due to the
significantly increased performance of the company

     selling  general  and  administrative   expenses   selling  general  and
administrative  expenses  consist  primarily  of  salaries  employee  benefits
travel  promotion  communications  management  finance  administrative  and

depreciation  and  amortization  increased  by  192  or  approximately  99
million  from  approximately  513 million during 2001 to approximately  612
million during 2002 and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately
289 to 267 respectively  the increase in such expenses in absolute dollars
was due  primarily  to  expenses  incurred  to expand  the  companys  sales and
marketing  activities  and  increased  infrastructure  expenses  to support  the
companys  growth  the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was
due  primarily to the  increased  revenues that have resulted from the companys
expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years

approximately  452 million during 2002  representing  approximately 200 and
197 of  revenues  respectively  the  decrease  in  operating  margin was due
primarily to higher incentive compensation costs in 2002 as compared to 2001

     other incomeexpense  other incomeexpense  consists primarily of interest
income offset  by foreign currency  exchange losses and in 2001 an impairment
loss on an  investment  and in 2002  splitoff  costs  related to the exchange
offer in which ims  health has  offered  to its  stockholders  to  exchange  its

interest  income  decreased by  approximately  277  from  approximately  25
million during 2001 to  approximately  18 million during 2002 the decrease in
such interest income was attributable primarily to lower interest rates offset
in part by higher operating cash balances the company recognized a net foreign
currency  exchange  loss of  approximately  767000  during 2001 compared to an
exchange loss of  approximately  235000 during 2002 as a result of the effect
of changing exchange rates on the companys transactions the company recognized
an impairment  loss on its  investment  in questra  corporation  questra  of
approximately  20 million  during the fourth quarter of 2001 in recognition of
an other than temporary  decline in value the impairment loss was based upon an
implied  valuation  of  questra  as a result of a recent  new  round of  venture
capital  funding  in  which  the  companys   equity  interest  in  questra  was
substantially   diluted  and  investors   other  than  the  company   received
preferential  liquidation  rights the impairment loss net of tax benefit  was
approximately  12  million  or 006 per  diluted  share  see note 4 to the

approximately 17 million or 008 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of
2002  related  to the  exchange  offer and  expects  total  charges  aggregating
approximately  35 million in relation to onetime  costs  associated  with the
exchange offer such charges  primarily relate to direct and incremental  legal
accounting  printing and other  costs  in addition  total  estimated  charges
include  approximately  05  million  of costs  related  to the  retention  and
acceleration of cognizant stock options by two former directors of cognizant who
resigned on february 13 2003 as a result of the splitoff

     provision for income taxes  the provision for income taxes  decreased from
approximately 132 million in 2001 to approximately 105 million in 2002 with
an effective  tax rate of 374 in 2001 and 234 in 2002  the lower  effective
tax rate reflects cognizants change in its intention regarding the repatriation
of 2002 and future earnings from its subsidiary in india as well as a change in
the manner in which repatriated  earnings are taxed in india see note 6 to the
consolidated financial statements

     net income net income increased from  approximately  222 million in 2001
to approximately  346 million in 2002  representing  approximately  125 and

requirements beyond this 12month period will depend on many factors  including
the rate if any at which its cash flow increases  its ability and willingness
to accomplish  acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock its continued
intent not to  repatriate  earnings  from  india  its ability not to breach the
distribution  agreement  dated  january 7 2003  between  the  company and ims

industry background

     many companies  today face increasing  customer  demands to improve service
levels lower costs and shorten time to market in this competitive environment
improving it systems and leveraging the internet are critical to achieving these
objectives  at the same time the pace of technology evolution has accelerated
in order to remain  competitive  companies are  increasingly  required to adopt
emerging technologies such as

     o ebusiness and ecommerce applications

     o data warehousing

     o supply chain management and

     o middleware  enterprise application integration

     these emerging  technologies offer the promise of faster  more responsive
lower cost business  operations  however  their  development  integration and
ongoing  management  present  major  challenges  and require a large  number of
highly skilled  individuals trained in many diverse  technologies  in addition
companies also require additional  technical resources to maintain  enhance and
reengineer their core legacy systems for ebusiness and to address  application
management  projects  such as  eurocurrency  compliance  decimalization  in the
securities industry and the health insurance portability and accountability act
hipaa regulations in the healthcare industry  increasingly  companies turn
to solutions providers such as cts to provide these services

     many  companies  have made the  strategic  decision  to focus on their core
competencies  and  reduce  their  cost  structures  rather  than  invest  in the
additional large it staffs that are necessary to evaluate  implement and manage
it initiatives in a rapidly changing environment  consequently these companies
have  turned to it  service  providers  both to  develop  and  implement  new it
solutions and to maintain core systems

     as the global demand for it services has increased the number of qualified
technical professionals has not kept pace with such demand as a result some it
service  providers  have

                                       5

attempted  to access  the large  talent  pool in certain  developing  countries
particularly  india  india  is  widely  acknowledged  as a leader  in  offshore
software  development  and has the second  largest pool of it talent  behind the
us  historically  it  service  providers  have used the  offshore  labor pool
primarily to  supplement  the internal  staffing  needs of  customers  however
evolving customer demands have led to the utilization of offshore  resources for
higher  valueadded  services  such services include  application  development
integration and maintenance the use of offshore personnel can offer a number of
benefits   including  faster  delivery  of  new  it  solutions  more  flexible
scheduling and lower costs however  utilizing an offshore workforce to provide
valueadded services presents a number of challenges to it service providers

     the offshore  implementation  of  valueadded  software  services  requires
highly developed project management skills such skills are necessary to design
develop  and  deploy   highquality   technology   solutions  in  a  timely  and
costeffective   manner  in  addition  it  service  providers  must  have  the
methodologies   processes  and  communications   capabilities  to  successfully
integrate  offshore  workforces with onsite  personnel  service providers must
also have strong research and development capabilities and technology competency
centers   finally   service  providers   utilizing  offshore  workforces  must
continually  recruit and manage  their  workforces  to deliver  solutions  using
emerging  technologies  as a result  of the  increasing  demand  for  global it
services  a significant  opportunity  exists for it service  providers that can
successfully address the challenges in utilizing an offshore talent pool

item 5  market for the companys common equity and related stockholder matters

     prior to june 1998 there was no established market for the companys class
a common stock  since june 19 1998 the class a common stock has traded on the
nasdaq national market nnm under the symbol ctsh

     all of the issued and  outstanding  shares of class b common stock are held
by ims health  each outstanding share of class b common stock is convertible at
the holders  option into one share of class a common stock at any time prior to
a taxfree  spinoff as defined  below  if a taxfree  spinoff  occurs  the
stockholders  of ims  health  will  receive  class b common  stock  which  will
continue  to have ten votes per  share  as  compared  to one vote per share for
class a common  stock  such shares of class b common stock shall  convert upon
transfer  to class a common  stock  additionally  each share of class b common
stock  automatically  converts  into one share of class a common stock if at any
time the number of outstanding  shares of class b common stock  represents  less
than 350 of the economic  ownership  represented  by the  aggregate  number of
shares of common stock then outstanding

     except as provided below any shares of class b common stock transferred to
a person other than ims health shall automatically  convert to shares of class a
common stock upon such  disposition  shares of class b common stock transferred
to  stockholders  of ims health in a  transaction  intended  to be on a taxfree
basis a  taxfree  spinoff  under the code  shall not  convert to shares of
class a common stock upon the occurrence of such taxfree spinoff

     following a taxfree spinoff shares of class b common stock shall convert
upon transfer to class a common stock provided however that shares of class b
common stock shall automatically  convert into shares of class a common stock on
the fifth  anniversary of the taxfree  spinoff  unless prior to such taxfree
spinoff  ims  health  delivers  to  the  company  written  advice  of  counsel
reasonably  satisfactory  to the company to the effect that i such  conversion
could  adversely  affect the ability of ims health to obtain a favorable  ruling
from the  internal  revenue  service that the  distribution  would be a taxfree
spinoff or ii the internal  revenue service has adopted a general  nonruling
policy on taxfree spinoffs and that such conversion could adversely affect the
status of the  transaction  as a taxfree  spinoff  if such written  advice is
received  approval  of such  conversion  shall  be  submitted  to a vote of the
holders of the common stock as soon as practicable  after the fifth  anniversary
of the  taxfree  spinoff  unless ims health  delivers to the company  written
advice  of  counsel  reasonably  satisfactory  to  the  company  prior  to  such
anniversary that such vote could adversely affect the status of the distribution
as a taxfree spinoff  including the ability to obtain a favorable ruling from
the internal  revenue  service  if such written advice is delivered  such vote
shall not be held approval of such conversion will require the affirmative vote
of the  holders  of a majority  of the  shares of both class a common  stock and
class b common stock present and voting voting together as a single class with
each share entitled to one vote for such purpose no assurance can be given that
such conversion would be consummated the foregoing requirements are intended to
ensure that taxfree  treatment of a taxfree  spinoff is preserved  should the
internal  revenue service  challenge such automatic  conversion as violating the
800 vote requirement currently required by the code for a taxfree spinoff

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
         of operations

overview

     the  company  delivers  highquality   costeffective   full  life  cycle
solutions  to  complex  software   development  and  maintenance  problems  that
companies face as they transition to ebusiness these it services are delivered
through the use of a seamless onsite and offshore  consulting project team the
companys service offerings include

     o application development and integration

     o application management and

     o reengineering

     during  1996  the company made a strategic  decision to attract  customers
that  were  not  affiliated  with  cognizant  corporation  or any of the  former
affiliates   of  the  dun    bradstreet   corporation   as  a  result  of  the
implementation of this strategy the company has successfully  transitioned from
a company  primarily  serving  affiliated  customers to a company whose customer
base now consists primarily of unaffiliated third parties for example revenues
derived from  customers not currently or  previously  affiliated  with the dun 
bradstreet  corporation  cognizant  corporation  ims health  and any of their
respective  subsidiaries grew from 505 million or 568 of revenues  in 1999
to 923 million or 674 of revenues in 2000 and to 129 million or 723 of
revenues in 2001 approximately 432 326 and 277 of the companys revenues
in 1999  2000 and 2001  respectively  were  generated from current and former
affiliates including  approximately 167 104 and 106  respectively  from
ims health and its current subsidiaries

     the  company has derived  and  believes  that it will  continue to derive a
significant  portion of its revenues from a limited number of large  thirdparty
customers  during 1999  2000 and 2001  the companys  five largest  customers
other than ims health and its current subsidiaries  accounted for 449 345
and  285 of  revenues  respectively  in 1999  ims  health  and  first  data
corporation  accounted  for more than 100 of  revenue  in 2000 and 2001  ims

     in addition  financial  reporting  release no 61 was recently released by
the sec to require all companies to include a discussion to address among other
things liquidity  offbalance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and
commercial commitments

     the  companys  discussion  and  analysis of its  financial  condition  and
results of  operations  are based upon its  consolidated  financial  statements
which have been  prepared in accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the united  states  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  in
accordance with generally  accepted  accounting  principles in the united states
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities  including the recoverability of tangible and
intangible  assets  disclosure of contingent  assets and  liabilities as of the
date of the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and
expenses during the reported period

     on an  ongoing  basis  the  company  evaluates  its  estimates  the most
significant estimates relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve for
warranties  reserves for employee benefits income taxes depreciation of fixed
assets and longlived  assets  contingencies and litigation and the recognition
of  revenue  and  profits  based  on the  percentage  of  completion  method  of
accounting  for  fixed  bid  contracts  the  company  bases  its  estimates  on
historical  experience and on various other  assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable  under the  circumstances  the  results  of which form the basis for
making  judgments about the carrying  values of assets and liabilities  that are
not readily  apparent  from other  sources  actual  results could vary from the
estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the accompanying  financial
statements

     all of the companys software development centers  including a substantial
majority of its employees are located in india as a result  the company may be
subject to certain risks  associated with  international  operations  including
risks  associated with foreign  currency  exchange rate  fluctuations  and risks
associated  with the  application  and imposition of protective  legislation and
regulations  relating to import and export or otherwise  resulting  from foreign
policy or the variability of foreign economic  conditions  to date the company
has not engaged in any hedging  transactions  to mitigate its risks  relating to
exchange rate  fluctuations  additional  risks  associated  with  international
operations include difficulties in enforcing  intellectual  property rights the
burdens of complying  with a wide variety of foreign laws  potentially  adverse
tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers

     the company believes the following critical  accounting policies affect its
more  significant  judgments  and  estimates  used  in  the  preparation  of its
consolidated financial statements

     revenue  recognition  the companys  services are entered into on either a
tm or fixedprice  basis  revenues  related to tm contracts are recognized as
the  service  is  performed  revenues  related  to  fixedprice  contracts  are
recognized as the service is performed using the percentageofcompletion method
of accounting  under which the sales value of performance  including estimated
earnings  thereon  is  recognized  on the  basis of the  percentage  that  each
contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated cost fixed price contracts
are cancelable  subject to a specified notice period  all services  provided by
the company  through  the date of  cancellation  are due and  payable  under the
contract  terms  the company issues  invoices  related

                                       24
page

to fixed price contracts based upon  achievement of milestones  during a project
or other contractual terms  differences  between the timing of billings  based
upon contract  milestones or other  contractual  terms  and the  recognition of
revenue  based  upon the  percentageofcompletion  method of  accounting  are
recognized  as either  unbilled or deferred  revenue  estimates  are subject to
adjustment  as a project  progresses to reflect  changes in expected  completion
costs  the  cumulative  impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the
financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known and any
anticipated  losses on  contracts  are  recognized  immediately  a reserve  for
warranty provisions under such contracts  which generally exist for ninety days
past contract completion is estimated and accrued during the contract period

     foreign currency  translation  the assets and liabilities of the companys
canadian and european  subsidiaries  are translated into us dollars from local
currencies at current  exchange  rates and revenues and expenses are  translated
from  local   currencies  at  average  monthly  exchange  rates  the  resulting
translation  adjustments are recorded in a separate  component of  stockholders
equity  for the companys  indian  subsidiary  cts  india  the  functional
currency is the us  dollar  since its sales are made  primarily in the united
states  the sales price is  predominantly  in us  dollars and there is a high
volume of  intercompany  transactions  denominated in us  dollars  between cts
india  and  its  us  affiliates   nonmonetary  assets  and  liabilities  are
translated at historical  exchange rates  while monetary assets and liabilities
are translated at current  exchange rates the resulting gain loss is included
in other income

     allowance  for doubtful  accounts  the company  maintains  allowances  for
doubtful  accounts for  estimated  losses  resulting  from the  inability of its
customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the companys
customers  were to  deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to
make payments additional allowances may be required

     income  taxes  the  company  records a valuation  allowance  to reduce its
deferred  tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be  realized
while the company has considered  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and
feasible  tax  planning  strategies  in  assessing  the need  for the  valuation
allowance  in the event the company were to determine  that it would be able to
realize  its  deferred  tax assets in the  future in excess of its net  recorded
amount  an  adjustment to the deferred tax asset would  increase  income in the
period such determination was made likewise  should the company determine that
it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the
future  an  adjustment  to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in
the period such  determination  was made  additionally  the  company  provides
deferred taxes on the earnings of its indian  subsidiary based on the assumption
that those  earnings will be  repatriated  should the company  subsequently  be
unable to repatriate  such earnings  based on  regulatory or other  factors  or
decide not to repatriate these or future earnings an adjustment to the deferred
tax  liability  account  would be  credited  to  income  in the  period  of such
determination

     revenue  revenue increased by 297 or 407 million from 1370 million
during 2000 to 1778 million in 2001 this increase  resulted  primarily from a
277 million  429  increase in  application  management and a 135 million
188 increase in application development and integration partially offset by
an  approximately  05  million  1000  decrease  in  year  2000  compliance

purposes  revenues from related parties only include revenues recognized during
the period in which the related party was  affiliated  with the company  during

personnel  and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues the companys
cost of revenues increased by 290 or 204 million from 704 million during
2000 to 908  million in 2001  the increase was due primarily to the increased
cost  resulting  from the  increase  in the  number of the  companys  technical
professionals  from  approximately  2800  employees  at  december  31  2000 to
approximately  3470  employees at december 31 2001  the  increased  number of

margin  increased  from 486 of  revenues  during  2000 to 489 of revenues in
2001 the increase in such gross profit margin was primarily  attributable  to a
continued  shift toward higher margin fixed bid contracts and a lower  incentive
compensation accrual in 2001 as compared to 2000

depreciation and amortization  increased by 268 or 108 million from 405
million  during 2000 to 513 million during 2001 and decreased as a percentage
of revenue from approximately 295 to 289 respectively the increase in such
expenses in absolute  dollars was due  primarily to expenses  incurred to expand
the  companys  sales and  marketing  activities  and  increased  infrastructure
expenses to support the  companys  growth  the decrease in such  expenses as a
percentage  of revenue was  primarily  due to the  increased  revenues that have
resulted  from the  companys  expanded  sales and  marketing  activities in the
current and prior years

     income  from  operations   income  from  operations  increased  363  or
approximately  95 million  from  approximately  261 million  during 2000 to
356  million  during  2001  representing  approximately  191  and  200 of

income offset  by foreign currency  exchange losses and in 2001 an impairment
loss on an investment  interest income  decreased by  approximately  56 from
26  million  during 2000 to 25  million  during  2001  the decrease in such
interest income was attributable  primarily to lower interest rates  offset in
part by higher  operating cash balances  the company  recognized a net foreign
currency exchange loss of approximately 767000 during 2001 as a result of the
effect of changing  exchange  rates on the companys  transactions  the company
recognized  an  impairment  loss  on  its  investment  in  questra   corporation
questra of  approximately  20 million during the fourth quarter of 2001 in
recognition of an other than temporary decline in value the impairment loss was
based upon an implied  valuation of questra as a result of a recent new round of
venture  capital  funding in which the companys  equity interest in questra was
substantially   diluted  and  investors   other  than  the  company   received
preferential  liquidation  rights the impairment loss net of tax benefit  was
12  million  or 006  per  diluted  share  see  note 5 to the  consolidated

funding had been cash flow from operations and intercompany  cash transfers with
its majority owner and controlling parent company cognizant  corporation and ims
health  in june 1998 the company  consummated  its initial public  offering of
5834000  shares of its class a common  stock at a price to the public of 500
per share  of which  5000000  shares  were issued and sold by the company and
834000  shares  were sold  at that time  by  cognizant  corporation  the net
proceeds to the company from the offering were approximately 224 million after
845000 of direct expenses  the funds received by the company from the initial
public offering were invested in shortterm  investment grade interest bearing
securities  after the  company  used a  portion  of the net  proceeds  to repay
approximately 66 million of thenexisting  nontrade related party balances to
cognizant  corporation  the company has used and plans to use the  remainder of
the net proceeds  from the  offering as well as other cash for i  expansion of
existing operations  including its offshore software development centers  ii
continued  development of new service lines and possible acquisitions of related
businesses  including cost and equity  investments  and iii general corporate
purposes including working capital

302 million and 194 million for the years ended december 31 2001  2000 and
1999 respectively  the increase in 2001 as compared to the prior year resulted
primarily  from  increased  tax  benefits  related  to  stock  plans  increased
depreciation and  amortization  a smaller  increase in accounts  receivable and
increased net income  offset  in part by decreased levels of yearend accrued
liabilities and accounts payable  due primarily to the timing of payments  the
increase for 2000 compared to 1999 results  primarily from  increased  levels of
accrued  liabilities and accounts payable  increased net income and an increase
in  deferred  taxes  partially  offset  in  part  by  increases  in  accounts
receivable and other current assets  trade accounts  receivable  increased from
100  million at december 31 1999 to 205 million at december 31 2000 and to
225 million at december 31 2001 unbilled accounts receivable  increased from
11  million at december  31 1999 to 19  million at december 31 2000 and to
54  million at december 31 2001  the increase in trade  accounts  receivable
during 2001 was due  primarily  to increased  revenue  the increase in unbilled
accounts receivable in 2001 compared to prior years was primarily related to the
increase in the percentage of revenues  derived from fixed bid contracts and the
related timing of contractual billings the company monitors turnover aging and
the  collection of accounts  receivable  through the use of  management  reports
which are prepared on a customer  basis and evaluated by the  companys  finance
staff  at december 31 2001 the companys days sales  outstanding  including

million and 59 million for the years ended  december 31 2001  2000 and 1999

2000 of net  cash  used  in  investing  activities  compared  to 1999  primarily
reflects an increase in purchases of property and equipment

     in june 2000 the company  announced a strategic  relationship with trident
capital  a  leading  venture  capital  firm  to  jointly  invest  in  emerging
ebusiness service and technology  companies  in accordance with this strategy
the  company  invested  approximately  2  million in  questra  corporation  an
ebusiness software and consulting firm headquartered in rochester new york in
return for an initial 58 equity interest  trident capital also  independently
made a direct investment in questra corporation based upon an implied valuation
of questra as a result of a recent new round of venture capital funding in which
the  companys  equity  interest  in  questra  was  substantially   diluted  and
investors other than the company received preferential liquidation rights the
company  recorded  an  impairment  loss  for  the  full  20  million  original
investment in recognition of an other than temporary  impairment  the companys
investment is being accounted for under the cost basis of accounting  see note

million and 07 million for the years ended  december 31 2001  2000 and 1999
respectively  the increase in each year was primarily related to a higher level
of cash proceeds  from the exercise of stock  options and employee  purchases of
stock

     the company  believes that its available  funds and the cash flows expected
to be  generated  from  operations  will be adequate to satisfy its current and
planned  operations  and needs for at least the next 12  months  the  companys
ability to expand and grow its business in  accordance  with current  plans  to
make  acquisitions  and form joint  ventures and to meet its  longterm  capital
requirements beyond this 12month period will depend on many factors  including
the rate if any at which its cash flow increases  its ability and willingness
to  accomplish  acquisitions  and  joint  ventures  with  capital  stock and the
availability to the company of public and private debt and equity financing the
company  cannot be certain  that  additional  financing  if  required  will be
available on terms favorable to it if at all

foreign currency translation

     the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  companys   canadian  and  european
subsidiaries  are  translated  into us  dollars at current  exchange rates and
revenues and expenses are  translated at average  monthly  exchange  rates  the
resulting  translation  adjustments  are  recorded  in a separate  component  of
stockholders  equity  for the  companys  indian  subsidiary  the  functional
currency is the us  dollar  since its sales are made  primarily  in the united
states  the sales price is predominantly in us  dollars  and there is a high
volume of  intercompany  transactions  denominated in us  dollars  between the
indian  subsidiary and the companys us  affiliates  nonmonetary  assets and

and  liabilities  are  translated at current  exchange  rates  a portion of the
companys  costs in india are  denominated  in local  currency  and  subject  to
exchange  fluctuations  which has not had any material  effect on the companys
results of operations

effects of inflation

     the companys most significant  costs are the salaries and related benefits
for its programming staff and other professionals  competition in india and the
united states for  professionals  with advanced  technical  skills  necessary to
perform the  services  offered by the company have caused wages to increase at a
rate  greater  than the  general  rate of  inflation  as with  other it service
providers  the company must adequately anticipate wage increases  particularly
on its fixedprice contracts there can be no assurance that the company will be
able to recover cost increases  through  increases in the prices that it charges
for its services in the united states and elsewhere

all periods presented all intercompany transactions are eliminated

cash and cash equivalents  cash and cash equivalents primarily include time and
demand deposits in the companys operating bank accounts  the company considers
all highly liquid  instruments  with an initial maturity of three months or less
to be cash equivalents

investments investments in business entities in which the company does not have
control or the ability to exercise significant  influence over the operating and
financial  policies are  accounted  for under the cost method  investments  are
evaluated at each balance sheet date for impairment

accumulated depreciation  depreciation is calculated on the straightline basis
over the  estimated  useful  lives of the  assets  leasehold  improvements  are
amortized on a straightline  basis over the shorter of the term of the lease or
the  estimated  useful  life of the  improvement  maintenance  and  repairs are
expensed as incurred while renewals and betterments are capitalized

purchased  software  purchased  software  that is intended  for internal use is
capitalized  including the salaries and benefits of employees that are directly
involved  in the  installation  of such  software  the  capitalized  costs  are
amortized on a straightline method over the lesser of three years or its useful
life

goodwill  goodwill  represents  the excess of the purchase  price of the former
minority  interest in the companys  indian  subsidiary  over the fair values of
amounts  assigned to the incremental net assets acquired  amortization  expense

industry background

     many companies  today face increasing  customer  demands to improve service
levels lower costs and shorten time to market in this competitive environment
improving information  technology it systems and leveraging the internet are
critical to achieving these objectives at the same time the pace of technology
evolution  has  accelerated  in  order to  remain  competitive  companies  are
increasingly required to adopt emerging technologies such as

     o  ebusiness and ecommerce applications

     o  data warehousing

     o  supply chain management and

     o  middleware  enterprise application integration


                                       4

     these emerging  technologies offer the promise of faster  more responsive
lower cost business  operations  however  their  development  integration and
ongoing  management  present  major  challenges  and require a large  number of
highly skilled  individuals trained in many diverse  technologies  in addition
companies also require additional  technical resources to maintain  enhance and
reengineer their core legacy systems for ebusiness and to address  application
management  projects  such as  eurocurrency  compliance  decimalization  in the
securities industry and the health insurance portability and accountability act
hipaa regulations in the healthcare industry  increasingly  companies turn
to solutions providers such as cts to provide these services

     many  companies  have made the  strategic  decision  to focus on their core
competencies  and  reduce  their  cost  structures  rather  than  invest  in the
additional large it staffs that are necessary to evaluate  implement and manage
it initiatives in a rapidly changing environment  consequently these companies
have  turned to it  service  providers  both to  develop  and  implement  new it
solutions and to maintain core systems

     as the global demand for it services has increased the number of qualified
technical professionals has not kept pace with such demand as a result some it
service  providers  have  attempted  to access the large  talent pool in certain
developing  countries  particularly  india  india is widely  acknowledged as a
leader in offshore  software  development  and has the second largest pool of it
talent behind the us historically it service providers have used the offshore
labor pool  primarily to supplement  the internal  staffing  needs of customers
however  evolving  customer  demands  have led to the  utilization  of offshore
resources for higher  valueadded  services  such services include  application
development  integration  and  maintenance  the use of offshore  personnel can
offer a number of benefits  including faster delivery of new it solutions more
flexible scheduling and lower costs however utilizing an offshore workforce to
provide  valueadded  services  presents  a number of  challenges  to it service
providers

     the offshore  implementation  of  valueadded  software  services  requires
highly developed project management skills such skills are necessary to design
develop  and  deploy   highquality   technology   solutions  in  a  timely  and
costeffective   manner  in  addition  it  service  providers  must  have  the
methodologies   processes  and  communications   capabilities  to  successfully
integrate  offshore  workforces with onsite  personnel  service providers must
also have strong research and development capabilities and technology competency
centers   finally   service  providers   utilizing  offshore  workforces  must
continually  recruit and manage  their  workforces  to deliver  solutions  using
emerging  technologies  as a result  of the  increasing  demand  for  global it
services  a significant  opportunity  exists for it service  providers that can
successfully  address the challenges in utilizing an offshore  talent pool in a
recent study  mckinsey and company has  estimated  that the market for offshore
work in india will grow from  approximately 4 billion in 1998 to 87 billion in
2008

transfer  to class a common  stock  additionally  each share of class b common
stock  automatically  converts  into one share of class a common stock if at any
time the number of outstanding  shares of class b common stock  represents  less
than 350 of the economic  ownership  represented  by the  aggregate  number of
shares of common stock then outstanding

     except as provided below any shares of class b common stock transferred to

reasonably  satisfactory  to the company to the effect that i such  conversion
could  adversely  affect the ability of ims health to obtain a favorable  ruling
from the  internal  revenue  service that the  distribution  would be a taxfree
spinoff or ii the internal  revenue service has adopted a general  nonruling
policy on taxfree spinoffs and that such conversion could adversely affect the

anniversary that such vote could adversely affect the status of the distribution
as a taxfree spinoff  including the ability to obtain a favorable ruling from
the internal  revenue  service  if such written advice is delivered  such vote
shall not be held approval of such conversion will require the affirmative vote
of the  holders  of a majority  of the  shares of both class a common  stock and
class b common stock present and voting voting together as a single class with
each share entitled to one vote for such purpose no assurance can be given that
such conversion would be consummated the foregoing requirements are intended to
ensure that taxfree  treatment of a taxfree  spinoff is preserved  should the
internal  revenue service  challenge such automatic  conversion as violating the
800 vote requirement currently required by the code for a taxfree spinoff

through the use of a seamless onsite and offshore  consulting project team the
companys service offerings include

     o  application development and integration

     o  application management and

     o  reengineering

     the  company  began  its  software  development  and  maintenance  services
business in early 1994 as an inhouse technology development center for the dun
 bradstreet  corporation and its operating  units in 1996 the company  along
with erisco  ims  international  nielsen media  research  pilot  software and
strategic  technologies and certain other entities  plus a majority interest in
gartner group were spunoff from the dun  bradstreet  corporation to form a new
company  cognizant  corporation  in 1997  the  company  purchased  the  240
minority  interest in its indian subsidiary from a third party for 34 million
making the indian subsidiary wholly owned by the company

     in june 1998 the company  completed its initial public  offering  on june
30 1998 a majority  interest in the company  erisco  ims  international  and
certain other  entities were spunoff  from  cognizant  corporation  to form ims
health  at december  31  2000  ims health  owned  approximately  605 of the
outstanding  stock of the company and held  approximately  939 of the combined
voting power of the companys common stock

     on february 11 2000 the board of directors declared a 2for1 stock split
effected by a 100 dividend  payable on march 16 2000 to stockholders of record
on march 2  2000  the  stock  split  has been  reflected  in the  accompanying
consolidated  financial  statements  and all  applicable  references  as to the
number  of  common  shares  and  per  share   information  have  been  restated
appropriate  adjustments  have been  made in the  exercise  price and  number of
shares subject to stock options  stockholder equity accounts have been restated
to  reflect  the  reclassification  of an  amount  equal to the par value of the
increase in issued common shares from the additional  paidincapital account to
the common stock accounts

     on may 23 2000 the  stockholders  of the company  approved an increase in
the  number  of  authorized  class b common  stock  from  15000000  shares  to
25000000 shares

     during  1996  the company made a strategic  decision to attract  customers
that  were  not  affiliated  with  cognizant  corporation  or any of the  former
affiliates   of  the  dun    bradstreet   corporation   as  a  result  of  the
implementation of this strategy the company has successfully  transitioned from
a company  primarily  serving  affiliated  customers to a company whose customer
base now consists primarily of unaffiliated third parties for example revenues

derived from  customers not currently or  previously  affiliated  with the dun 
bradstreet  corporation  cognizant  corporation  ims health  and any of their
respective  subsidiaries grew from 269 million or 460 of revenues  in 1998
to 505 million  or 568 of revenues  in 1999 and 923 million or 674 of
revenues  in 2000  approximately  540  432  and  326  of the  companys
revenues in 1998 1999 and 2000  respectively  were generated from current and
former affiliates including approximately 180 167 and 104  respectively
from ims health and its current subsidiaries

     the  company has derived  and  believes  that it will  continue to derive a
significant  portion of its revenues from a limited number of large  thirdparty
customers  during 1998  1999 and 2000  the companys  five largest  customers
other than ims health and its current subsidiaries  accounted for 437 449
and 345 of revenues respectively in 1998 ims health first data corporation
and acnielsen each accounted for more than 100 of revenue in 1999 ims health
and first data  corporation  accounted for more than 100 of revenue  in 2000
ims  health  accounted  for more  than  100 of  revenues  the  volume of work
performed for ims health and its  subsidiaries  and other customers is likely to
vary from year to year major customers whether affiliated or unaffiliated  in
one year may not provide the same level of revenues in any subsequent year

     prior to fiscal  2000  year 2000  compliance  services  were an  important
element of the companys service offerings  approximately 441 156 and 04
of the  companys  revenues were derived from year 2000  compliance  services in
1998 1999 and 2000 respectively the company believes that it has successfully
utilized  its  year  2000   compliance   expertise   to  establish   new  client
relationships  and to deepen its  relationships  with  existing  customers  the
knowledge of customers  systems gained while  performing  year 2000  compliance
services  gave the  company  a  competitive  advantage  in  securing  additional
application development and application management projects for such customers

     application development and integration services represented  approximately
258  323  and  461 of  revenues  in 1998  1999 and  2000  respectively
application management services accounted for 211 440 and 470 of revenues
in 1998 1999 and 2000 respectively

     the  companys  services are  performed on either a  timeandmaterials  or
fixedprice  basis  revenues  related  to   timeandmaterials   contracts  are
recognized  as  the  service  is  performed  revenues  related  to  fixedprice
contracts  are   recognized   using  the   percentageofcompletion   method  of
accounting  under  such  method  the  sales  value of  performance  including
earnings  thereon  is  recognized  on the  basis of the  percentage  that  each
contracts  cost to date bears to the total estimated  contract cost  estimates
are  subject  to  adjustment  as a project  progresses  to  reflect  changes in
expected completion costs the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates of
the percentage of work completed is reflected in the financial  reporting period
in which the change in the estimate becomes known additionally any anticipated
losses are  recognized  immediately  since the  company  bears the risk of cost
overruns and inflation  associated  with  fixedprice  projects  the companys
operating results may be adversely  affected by changes in estimates of contract
completion costs

     revenue  revenue  increased by 541 or 481million  from 889 million
during 1999 to 1370 million during 2000 this increase resulted primarily from
a 615 million 820  increase in application  development  and  integration
application management reengineering and other services partially offset by an
approximately  134 million 965 decrease in year 2000 compliance  services
the percentage of revenues derived from unrelated  parties  increased from 833
during 1999 to 896 during 2000  this  increase  resulted  primarily  from the
companys  continued efforts to pursue  unaffiliated  thirdparty  customers and
expanded service offerings to existing unaffiliated customers  for statement of
operations  purposes  revenues  from  related  parties  only  include  revenues
recognized  during the period in which the related party was affiliated with the

cost of revenues increased by 526 or 243 million from 462 million during
1999 to 704  million  during  2000  the  increase  was due  primarily  to the
increased  cost  resulting  from the  increase  in the  number of the  companys
technical  professionals from approximately 2000 employees at december 31 1999
to  approximately  2800 employees at december 31 2000 the increased number of
technical  professionals  is a direct result of greater demand for the companys
services  the companys gross profit increased by 558 or approximately 239
million  from  approximately  427 million during 1999 to approximately  666
million during 2000 gross profit margin increased from 481 of revenues during
1999 to 486 of revenues  during 2000 the increase in such gross profit margin
was primarily  attributable to the increased  thirdparty  revenue and the shift
toward newer higher margin customers

administrative  expenses  consist  primarily  of  salaries  employee  benefits
travel  promotion  communications  management  finance  administrative  and

million  during 1999 to 405 million during 2000 and increased as a percentage
of revenue from approximately 294 to 295 respectively the increase in such
expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to
expenses  incurred to expand the companys  sales and marketing  activities  and
increased infrastructure expenses to support the companys revenue growth

approximately  95 million  from  approximately  166 million  during 1999 to
approximately  261 million during 2000  representing  approximately 187 and
191 of revenues  respectively the increase in operating margin was primarily
due to the  increased  thirdparty  revenue and the shift toward  newer  higher
margin customer services

part  by  foreign  currency  exchange  losses  interest  income  increased  by
approximately  1097  from 13  million  during  1999 to  approximately  26
million  during 2000  the  increase in such  interest  income was  attributable
primarily to generally higher operating cash balances  the company recognized a
net foreign currency  exchange loss of approximately  538000 during 2000 as a
result of the effect of changing exchange rates on the companys transactions

the percentage of revenues derived from unrelated  parties  increased from 768
during 1998 to 833 during 1999  this  increase  resulted  primarily  from the
companys continued efforts to pursue unaffiliated thirdparty customers and the
impact of the  spinoff  in june 1998 of a  majority  interest  in the  company
erisco  ims  international  and certain other entities to form ims health  for
statement of operations  purposes  revenues  from related  parties only include
revenues  recognized during the period in which the related party was affiliated
with the company  during 1999  sales to related party customers  accounted for
167 of revenues and one thirdparty  customer accounted for 174 of revenues
during 1998  sales to related party  customers  accounted for 232 of revenues
and two  thirdparty  customers  accounted  for  125  and  113 of  revenues
respectively

     gross profit  the companys cost of revenues  increased by 446 or 142
million  from 319  million  during 1998 to 462  million  during  1999  the
increase was due primarily to the increased  cost resulting from the increase in
the number of the companys  technical  professionals from  approximately  1400
employees at december 31 1998 to approximately  2000 employees at december 31
1999  the  increased  number of technical  professionals  is a direct result of
greater demand for the companys services  the companys gross profit increased
by 602  or  approximately  161 million  from  approximately  267 million
during 1998 to  approximately  427  million  during 1999  gross profit margin
increased from 455 of revenues  during 1998 to 481 of revenues  during 1999
the  increase in such gross  profit  margin was  primarily  attributable  to the
increased  thirdparty  revenue  and  the  shift  toward  newer  higher  margin
customers

     selling  general  and  administrative   expenses   selling  general  and
administrative expenses  including depreciation and amortization  increased by
469  or 83 million  from 178 million during 1998 to 261 million during
1999  but  decreased as a percentage  of revenue  from  approximately  303 to
294  respectively  the dollar increase in such expenses was primarily due to
expenses  incurred to expand the companys  sales and marketing  activities  and
increased  infrastructure  expenses to support the companys revenue growth the
decrease in selling  general and  administrative  expenses as a  percentage  of
revenue resulted from the companys increased revenues

     income  from  operations   income  from  operations  increased  866  or
approximately  77  million  from  approximately  89 million  during 1998 to
approximately  166 million during 1999  representing  approximately 152 and
187 of revenues  respectively the increase in operating margin was primarily
due to the  increased  thirdparty  revenue and the shift toward  newer  higher
margin customers discussed above

     other  income  other  income  consists  primarily  of interest  income and
foreign  currency  exchange gains  interest income  increased by  approximately
625000  from 638000 during 1998 to approximately  13 million during 1999
the  increase  in  such  interest  income  was  attributable  primarily  to  the
investment  of the net proceeds  generated  from the  companys  initial  public
offering and generally higher operating cash balances  the company recognized a
net foreign currency  exchange loss of  approximately  32000 during 1999 as a
result of changes in exchange rates on its transactions

     provision for income taxes  the provision for income taxes  increased from
36  million in 1998 to 67  million in 1999  with an  effective  tax rate of
374 in both 1998 and 1999

     net income net income increased from approximately 60 million in 1998 to
approximately  112  million  in  1999  representing  103  and  126  as  a
percentage of revenues respectively

liquidity and capital resources

     historically through the date of the ipo the companys primary sources of
funding had been cash flow from operations and intercompany  cash transfers with
its majority owner and controlling parent company cognizant  corporation and ims
health  in june 1998 the company  consummated  its initial public  offering of
5834000  shares of its class a common  stock at a price to the public of 500
per share  of which  5000000  shares  were issued and sold by the company and
834000  shares  were sold  at that time  by  cognizant  corporation  the net
proceeds to the company from the offering were approximately 224 million after
845000 of direct expenses  the funds received by the company from the initial
public offering were invested in shortterm  investment grade interest bearing
securities  after the  company  used a  portion  of the net  proceeds  to repay
approximately 66 million of thenexisting  nontrade related party balances to
cognizant  corporation  the company has used and plans to use the  remainder of
the net proceeds  from the  offering as well as other cash for i  expansion of
existing operations  including its offshore software development centers  ii
continued  development of new service lines and possible acquisitions of related
businesses  including cost and equity  investments  and iii general corporate
purposes including working capital

     net cash provided by operating  activities was approximately 302 million
194 million and 134 million for the years ended december 31 2000  1999 and
1998  respectively  the increase for 2000  compared to 1999 results  primarily
from increased levels of accrued liabilities and accounts payable increased net
income and an increase in  deferred  taxes  partially  offset by  increases  in
accounts  receivable and other current assets the increase for 1999 compared to
1998  results  primarily  from  increased  net income and a decrease in accounts
receivable  partially offset by a lower increase in accrued  liabilities  versus
the prior year accounts receivable decreased from 111 million at december 31
1998 to 100  million at december 31 1999 and  increased  to 205  million at
december  31  2000  the  increase in accounts  receivable  during 2000 was due
primarily to increased  revenue  the company monitors  turnover  aging and the
collection of accounts  receivable  through the use of management  reports which
are prepared on a customer  basis and evaluated by the companys  finance staff
at december 31 2000 the companys days sales outstanding  including unbilled
receivables was approximately 50 days

     the companys  investing  activities  used net cash of 126 million  59
million and 37 million for the years ended  december 31 2000  1999 and 1998
respectively  the  increase in 2000  compared to 1999  primarily  reflects  the
companys  increased  purchases of land  buildings  and equipment to expand the
companys  offshore  development  infrastructure  and an  investment  in questra
corporation of approximately  20 million in june 2000 the increase in 1999 of
net cash used in investing  activities  compared to 1998  primarily  reflects an
increase in purchases of property and equipment

     in june 2000 the company  announced a strategic  relationship with trident
capital  a  leading  venture  capital  firm  to  jointly  invest  in  emerging
ebusiness service and technology  companies  in accordance with this strategy
the  company  invested  approximately  2  million in  questra  corporation  an
ebusiness software and consulting firm headquartered in rochester new york in
return for a 58 equity  interest  trident capital also  independently  made a
direct  investment in questra  corporation  the  companys  investment is being
accounted for under the cost basis of accounting

     the companys financing activities provided net cash of 18 million  07
million and 161 million for the years ended december 31 2000  1999 and 1998
respectively  the increase in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily  related to a
higher level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock  options  the decrease
in 1999 compared to 1998 resulted from the absence of the net proceeds generated
from the initial public  offering of 224  million  offset by the repayment of
nontrade related party balances of approximately 66 million

     as of december 31 2000 the company had no significant thirdparty debt

     the company had working  capital of 615  million at december 31 2000 and
435 million at december 31 1999

     the company  believes that its available  funds and the cash flows expected
to be  generated  from  operations  will be adequate to satisfy its current and
planned  operations  and needs for at least the next 12  months  the  companys
ability to expand and grow its business in  accordance  with current  plans  to
make  acquisitions  and form joint  ventures and to meet its  longterm  capital
requirements beyond this 12month period will depend on many factors  including
the rate if any at which its cash flow increases  its ability and willingness
to  accomplish  acquisitions  and  joint  ventures  with  capital  stock and the
availability to the company of public and private debt and equity financing the
company  cannot be certain  that  additional  financing  if  required  will be
available on terms favorable to it if at all

foreign currency translation

     the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  companys   canadian  and  european
subsidiaries  are  translated  into us  dollars at current  exchange rates and
revenues and expenses are  translated at average  monthly  exchange  rates  the
resulting  translation  adjustments  are  recorded  in a separate  component  of
stockholders  equity  for the  companys  indian  subsidiary  the  functional
currency is the us  dollar  since its sales are made  primarily  in the united
states  the sales price is predominantly in us  dollars  and there is a high
volume of  intercompany  transactions  denominated in us  dollars  between the
indian subsidiary and the companys us affiliates

nonmonetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates
while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current  exchange rates
a portion of the companys  costs in india are denominated in local currency and
subject to exchange  fluctuations  which has not had any material effect on the
companys results of operations

effects of inflation

     the companys most significant  costs are the salaries and related benefits
for its programming staff and other professionals  competition in india and the
united states for  professionals  with advanced  technical  skills  necessary to
perform the  services  offered by the company have caused wages to increase at a
rate  greater  than the  general  rate of  inflation  as with  other it service
providers  the company must adequately anticipate wage increases  particularly
on its fixedprice contracts there can be no assurance that the company will be
able to recover cost increases  through  increases in the prices that it charges
for its services in the united states and elsewhere

financial  policies are  accounted  for under the cost method  investments  are
evaluated at each balance sheet date for impairment

management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of

expenses during the reported period  the most  significant  estimates relate to
the  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  reserve for  warranties  reserves for
