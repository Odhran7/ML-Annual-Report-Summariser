general 

we operate membership warehouses and ecommerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationallybranded and privatelabel products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins net sales less merchandise costs than most other retailers we often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it even while taking advantage of early payment discounts 

we buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to crossdocking consolidation points depots or directly to our warehouses our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses this process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies lowering costs associated with traditional multiplestep distribution channels for our ecommerce operations we ship merchandise through our depots our logistics operations for big and bulky items as well as through dropship and other delivery arrangements with our suppliers 

our average warehouse space is approximately 146000 square feet with newer units being slightly larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices our warehouses are not elaborate by strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format we believe our inventory losses shrinkage are well below those of typical retail operations 

our warehouses on average operate on a sevenday 70hour week gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than many other retailers and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities reducing labor required in general with variations by country our warehouses accept certain credit cards including costco cobranded cards debit cards cash and checks executive member 2 reward certificates cobrand cardholder rebates and our proprietary storedvalue card shop card 

our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of highquality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere we seek to limit most items to fastselling models sizes and colors we carry less than 4000 active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business significantly less than other broadline retailers we average anywhere from 10000 to 11000 skus online some of which are also available in our warehouses many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise on certain electronic items we typically have a 90day return policy and provide free of charge technical support services as well as an extended warranty additional thirdparty warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items 

we offer merchandise and services in the following categories 

core merchandise categories or core business 

• foods and sundries including sundries dry grocery candy cooler freezer deli liquor and tobacco

warehouse ancillary includes gasoline pharmacy optical food court hearing aids and tire installation and other businesses includes ecommerce business centers travel and other 

warehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses encouraging members to shop more frequently the number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country and we have no gasoline business in korea or china we operated 668 gas stations at the end of 2022 net sales for our gasoline business increased to approximately 14 of total net sales in 2022 

our other businesses sell products and services that complement our warehouse operations core and warehouse ancillary businesses our ecommerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services net sales for ecommerce represented approximately 7 of total net sales in 2022 this figure does not include other services we offer online in certain countries such as business delivery travel sameday grocery and various other services our business centers carry items tailored specifically for food services convenience stores and offices and offer walkin shopping and deliveries business centers are included in our total warehouse count costco travel offers vacation packages hotels cruises and other travel products exclusively for costco members offered in the us canada and the uk 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of brandname merchandise we do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier the covid19 pandemic created unprecedented supply constraints including disruptions and delays that have impacted and could continue to impact the flow and availability of certain products when sources of supply become unavailable we seek alternatives we also purchase and manufacture privatelabel merchandise as long as quality and member demand are high and the value to our members is significant 

certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report

human capital 

our code of ethics requires that we “take care of our employees” which is fundamental to the obligation to “take care of our members” we must also carefully control our selling general and administrative sga expenses so that we can sell high quality goods and services at low prices compensation and benefits for employees is our largest expense after the cost of merchandise and is carefully monitored 

employee base 

at the end of 2022 we employed 304000 employees worldwide the large majority approximately 95 is employed in our membership warehouses and distribution channels and less than 10 are represented by unions we also utilize seasonal employees during peak periods the total number of employees by segment is 



growth and engagement 

we believe that our warehouses are among the most productive in the retail industry owing in substantial part to the commitment and efficiency of our employees we seek to provide them not merely with employment but careers many attributes of our business contribute to the objective the more significant include competitive compensation and benefits for those working in our membership warehouses and distributions channels a commitment to promoting from within and maintaining a ratio of at least 50 of our employee base being fulltime employees these attributes contribute to what we consider especially for the industry a high retention rate in 2022 in the us that rate was approximately 90 for employees who have been with us for at least one year 

diversity equity and inclusion 

the commitment to “take care of our employees” is also the foundation of our approach to diversity equity and inclusion and creating an inclusive and respectful workplace in 2022 we appointed a new chief diversity and inclusion officer embracing differences is important to the growth of our company it leads to more opportunities innovation and employee satisfaction and connects us to the communities where we do business 

well being

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection location convenience distribution strategy and customer service we compete on a worldwide basis with global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenters internet retailers gasoline stations hard discounters department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise walmart target kroger and amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors in the us we also compete with other warehouse clubs including walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club many of the major metropolitan areas in the us and certain of our other international locations have multiple competing clubs

 item 1a—risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial these risk factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with management  s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this report 

business and operating risks 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our us and canadian operations 

our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our us and canadian operations which comprised 87 and 85 of net sales and operating income in 2022 respectively within the us we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 28 of us net sales in 2022 our california market in general has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our us operations particularly in california and our canadian operations could arise from among other things slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales comparable sales negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor healthcare and energy costs failing to meet targets for warehouse openings cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products 

we may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets and integrating acquisitions which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth is dependent in part on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing leasing and operating warehouses and depots we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms in addition certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability 

we seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance member traffic and profitability 

we intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us attracting members of other wholesale club operators our lesser familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence we cannot ensure that new warehouses and new ecommerce websites will be profitable and future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

we have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed accuracy and efficiency of our supply chains and delivery channels the effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than opening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return 

our failure to maintain membership growth loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations 

membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of executive membership and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable sales diminish member trust and reduce renewal rates and accordingly net sales and membership fee revenue negatively impacting our results of operations 

we sell many products under our kirkland signature brand maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty these products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales if the kirkland signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected 

disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing packaging manufacturing and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction 

we depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process primarily through our depots we also rely upon processing packaging manufacturing and other facilities to support our business which includes the production of certain privatelabel items although we believe that our operations are efficient disruptions due to fires tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes pandemics or other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members our ecommerce operations depend heavily on thirdparty and inhouse logistics providers and is negatively affected when these providers are unable to provide services in a timely fashion 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire our success depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including those relating to environmental social and governance practices and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly we may have excess inventory which could result in additional markdowns or we may experience outofstock positions and delivery delays which could result in higher costs both of which would reduce our operating performance this could have an adverse effect on net sales gross margin and operating income 

availability and performance of our information technology it systems are vital to our business failure to successfully execute it projects and have it systems available to our business would adversely impact our operations 

it systems play a crucial role in conducting our business these systems are utilized to process a very high volume of transactions conduct payment transactions track and value our inventory and produce reports critical for making business decisions failure or disruption of these systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to buy products and services from our suppliers produce goods in our manufacturing plants move the products in an efficient manner to our warehouses and sell products to our members we are undertaking large technology and it transformation projects the failure of these 

projects could adversely impact our business plans and potentially impair our day to day business operations given the high volume of transactions we process it is important that we build strong digital resiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages computer and telecommunications failures viruses internal or external security breaches errors by employees and catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes any debilitating failure of our critical it systems data centers and backup systems would require significant investments in resources to restore it services and may cause serious impairment in our business operations including loss of business services increased cost of moving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members we are currently making substantial investments in maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency and failure or delay in these projects could be costly and harmful to our business failure to deliver it transformation efforts efficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst multiplying threat landscapes and in compliance with privacy and data protection regulations globally failure to do so could damage our business including our reputation with members suppliers and employees cause us to incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and regulatory action 

increased security threats and more sophisticated cyber misconduct pose a risk to our systems networks products and services we rely upon it systems and networks some of which are managed by third parties in connection with virtually all of our business activities additionally we collect store and process sensitive information relating to our business members suppliers and employees operating these it systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data in a secure manner is critical to our business operations and strategy increased remote work has also increased the possible attack surfaces threats designed to gain unauthorized access to systems networks and data both ours and third parties with whom we work are increasing in frequency and sophistication cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crimes and advanced persistent threats phishing attacks have emerged as particularly prominent including as vectors for ransomware attacks which have increased in breadth and frequency while we train our employees as part of our security efforts that training cannot be completely effective these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality integrity and availability of our data it is possible that our it systems and networks or those managed by third parties such as cloud providers or suppliers that otherwise host confidential information could have vulnerabilities which could go unnoticed for a period of time while our cybersecurity and compliance efforts seek to mitigate such risks there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we and our thirdparty service providers have implemented and are implementing will be sufficient to protect our systems information or other property 

the potential impacts of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage litigation government enforcement actions penalties disruption to systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information corruption of data diminution in the value of our investment in it systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs this could adversely affect our competitiveness results of operations and financial condition and critically in light of our business model loss of member confidence further the insurance coverage we maintain and indemnification arrangements with thirdparties may be inadequate to cover claims costs and liabilities relating to cybersecurity incidents in addition data we collect store and process is subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations such as the european unions general data protection regulation california consumer privacy act health insurance portability and accountability act and other privacy and cybersecurity laws across the various states and around the globe which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including select credit and debit cards cash and checks cobrand cardholder rebates executive member 2 reward certificates and our shop card as we offer new payment options to our members we may be subject to additional rules regulations compliance requirements and higher fraud losses for certain payment methods we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees along with additional transaction processing fees we rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card it could disrupt our business if these parties become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to fee increases by these service providers 

we must comply with evolving payment card association and network operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers for example we are subject to payment card industry data security standards which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of individual cardholder data if our internal systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card reissuance costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members harm to our reputation and expose us to litigation 

if our merchandise including food and prepared food products for human consumption drugs children  s products pet products and durable goods do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety or labeling standards or our members  expectations we could experience lost sales increased costs litigation or reputational harm the sale of these items involves the risk of illness or injury to our members such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects substances chemicals other agents or residues introduced during the growing manufacturing storage handling and transportation phases or faulty design our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with safety and other standards while we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause illness or injury or that we will not be subject to claims lawsuits or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be longterm 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors our members are increasingly using mobile phones tablets computers and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media we are making investments in our websites and mobile applications if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant memberfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

inability to attract train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends on the continued contributions of our employees including members of our senior management and other key operations it merchandising and administrative personnel failure to identify and implement a succession plan for senior management could negatively impact our business we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors including the continuing impacts of the pandemic regulatory changes prevailing wage rates union relations and healthcare and other insurance costs we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur property casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance 

claims for employee health care benefits workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors’ and officers’ liability vehicle liability inventory loss and other exposures are funded predominantly through selfinsurance insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit exposures arising from very large losses the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements significant claims or events regulatory changes a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any warehouses depots manufacturing or home office facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations 

market and other external risks 

we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for members employees sites products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local regional and national wholesalers and retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries including other warehouseclub operators supermarkets supercenters internet retailers gasoline stations hard discounters department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways including pricing selection and availability services location convenience store hours and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications the evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop which has enhanced competition some competitors have greater financial resources and technology capabilities better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures changes in the retail markets or customer expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

higher energy and gasoline costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs consumer debt levels foreigncurrency exchange rates unsettled financial markets weaknesses in housing and real estate markets reduced consumer confidence changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal 

and tax policies including changes in tax rates duties tariffs or other restrictions sovereign debt crises pandemics and other health crises and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services require a change in product mix or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory additionally actions in various countries particularly china and the united states have affected the costs of some of our merchandise the degree of our exposure is dependent on among other things the type of goods rates imposed and timing of the tariffs the impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases higher tariffs could adversely impact our results 

prices of certain commodities including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand inflationary pressures labor costs competition market speculation government regulations taxes and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins these factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results general economic conditions can also be affected by events like the outbreak of hostilities including but not limited to the ukraine conflict or acts of terrorism 

inflationary factors such as increases in merchandise costs may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations if inflation on merchandise increases beyond our ability to control we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years due to among other things the continuing impacts of the pandemic and uncertain economic environment 

suppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards resulting in adverse effects on our business merchandise inventories sales and profit margins 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices as the quantities we require continue to grow we have no assurances of continued supply appropriate pricing or access to new products and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us member demands may lead to outofstock positions causing a loss of sales and profits 

we buy from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new suppliers and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality or more expensive because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited particularly for certain food items the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available 

our suppliers and those they depend upon for materials and services are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity natural disasters extreme weather conditions public health emergencies supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control packaging legal regulatory labor environmental or animal welfare standards these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members this failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands increase costs and otherwise adversely impact our business 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

during 2022 our international operations including canada generated 27 and 32 of our net sales and operating income respectively our international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses and we plan to continue international growth to prepare our consolidated financial statements we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars using current exchange rates future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our canadian and other international operations and have a corresponding adverse periodoverperiod effect on our results of operations as we continue to expand internationally our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase 

a portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold currency fluctuations may increase our merchandise costs and may not be passed on to members consequently fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

natural disasters extreme weather conditions public health emergencies or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

natural disasters and extreme weather conditions including those impacted by climate change such as hurricanes typhoons floods earthquakes wildfires droughts acts of terrorism or violence including active shooter situations energy shortages public health issues including pandemics and quarantines particularly in california or washington state where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located could negatively affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to our properties limitations on store operating hours less frequent visits by members to physical locations the temporary closure of warehouses depots manufacturing or home office facilities the temporary lack of an adequate work force disruptions to our it systems the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses public health issues whether occurring in the us or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or members or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels these events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic continues to affect our business financial condition and results of operations in many respects 

the continuing impacts of the covid19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and volatile and are affecting certain business operations demand for our products and services instock positions costs of doing business availability of labor access to inventory supply chain operations our ability to predict future performance exposure to litigation and our financial performance among other things 

other factors and uncertainties include but are not limited to 

• the severity and duration of the pandemic including future mutations or related variants of the virus in areas in which we operate 

• evolving macroeconomic factors including general economic uncertainty unemployment rates and recessionary pressures 

• changes in labor markets affecting us and our suppliers 

• unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response 

• the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides 

• the longterm impact of the pandemic on our business including consumer behaviors and 

• disruption and volatility within the financial and credit markets 

to the extent that covid19 continues to adversely affect the us and global economy our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition it may also heighten other risks described in this section including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations competition brand reputation implementation of strategic initiatives cybersecurity threats paymentrelated risks technology systems disruption supply chain disruptions labor availability and cost litigation operational risk as a result of remote work arrangements and regulatory requirements 

factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs and other regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability as the economy transitions to lower carbon intensity we cannot guarantee that we will make adequate investments or successfully implement strategies that will effectively achieve our climaterelated goals which could lead to negative perceptions among members and other stakeholders and result in reputational harm climate change extreme weather conditions wildfires droughts and rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience 

we also sell a substantial amount of gasoline the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and increased regulations more stringent fuel economy standards and public policies aimed at increasing the adoption of zeroemission and alternative fuel vehicles and other regulations related to climate change will affect our future operations and may adversely impact our profitability and require significant capital expenditures 

failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our warehouse and ecommerce comparable sales growth rates membership renewal rates new member signups gross margin earnings earnings per share new warehouse openings or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the price of our stock to decline

overview 

we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales particularly comparable sales net sales includes our core merchandise categories foods and sundries nonfoods and fresh foods warehouse ancillary gasoline pharmacy optical food court hearing aids and tire installation and other businesses ecommerce business centers travel and other we define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year including remodels relocations and expansions and sales related to ecommerce websites operating for more than one year comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit average ticket sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to our international operations inflation and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions the higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items the more we can leverage our sga expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the longterm another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business including the effects of inflation or deflation especially the united states net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread across a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including those with ecommerce operations while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our privatelabel items and through online offerings 

our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices we do not focus in the shortterm on maximizing prices charged but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years the impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases those strategies can include but are not limited to working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases earlierthanusual purchasing and in greater volumes offering seasonal merchandise outside its season as well as passing cost increases on to our members our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales gross margin percentage 

we believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our nongasoline business it also has lower sga expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our nongasoline business a higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near 

term net sales growth generally rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which given the higher sales base negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our sga expenses as a percentage of net sales a decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect additionally actions in various countries particularly china and the united states have affected the costs of some of our merchandise the degree of our exposure is dependent on among other things the type of goods rates imposed and timing of the tariffs higher tariffs could adversely impact our results 

we also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses as our warehouse base grows available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth the negative aspects of such growth however including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to continue our ecommerce business growth domestically and internationally has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations ecommerce sales growth slowed in 2022 compared to 2021 and 2020 

the membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of our executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets 

our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area some significant costs are partially outside our control particularly health care and utility expenses with respect to the compensation of our employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits rather we believe that achieving our longerterm objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business operates on very low margins modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income particularly merchandise costs and sga expenses can have substantial impacts on net income 

our operating model is generally the same across our us canadian and other international operating segments see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report certain operations in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales less or no direct membership warehouse competition or lack ecommerce or business delivery 

in discussions of our consolidated operating results we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which are the differences between the foreignexchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars this impact of foreignexchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current periods currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current periods average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period 

our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to august 31 references to 2022 2021 and 2020 relate to the 52week fiscal years ended august 28 2022 august 29 2021 and august 30 2020 respectively certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding unless otherwise noted references to net income relate to net income attributable to costco

• gross margin percentage decreased 65 basis points driven primarily by our core merchandise categories and a lifo charge for higher merchandise costs 

• sga expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 77 basis points primarily due to leveraging increased sales and ceasing of incremental wages related to covid19 despite additional wage and benefits increases 

• we incurred a onetime 77 pretax charge primarily related to granting our employees one additional day of paid time off in march 2022 

• the effective tax rate in 2022 was 246 compared to 240 in 2021 

• net income increased 17 to 5844 or 1314 per diluted share compared to 5007 or 1127 per diluted share in 2021

• in april 2022 the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from 079 to 090 per share 

covid19 

the covid19 pandemic continued to impact our business during 2022 albeit to a lesser extent covidrelated and other supply and logistics constraints have continued to adversely affect some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future during 2021 we paid 515 in incremental wages related to covid19 which ceased in february 2021 

results of operations 

net sales 



net sales 

net sales increased 30678 or 16 during 2022 the improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 14 and sales at new warehouses opened in 2021 and 2022 sales increased 15830 in core merchandise categories and 14848 in warehouse ancillary and other businesses the rate of increase was strongest in our gasoline business centers and travel businesses sales continued to be impacted by inflation higher than what we experienced in previous fiscal years 

during 2022 higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by 9230 481 basis points compared to 2021 with a 42 increase in the average price per gallon the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 22 positively impacting net sales by 3847 200 basis points changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately 1762 92 basis points compared to 2021 attributable primarily to our other international operations

membership fees 



membership fee revenue increased 9 in 2022 driven by new member signups and upgrades to executive membership changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted membership fees by 42 compared to 2021 at the end of 2022 our member renewal rates were 93 in the us and canada and 90 worldwide renewal rates continue to benefit from more members auto renewing and increased penetration of executive members who on average renew at a higher rate our renewal rate which excludes affiliates of business members is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date we account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis recognized ratably over the oneyear membership period 

gross margin 



total gross margin percentage decreased 65 basis points compared to 2021 excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales gross margin was 1094 a decrease of 19 basis points this was primarily due to a 33 basispoint decrease in core merchandise categories predominantly driven by decreases in fresh foods and foods and sundries and 19 basis points due to a lifo charge for higher merchandise costs gross margin was also negatively impacted by one basis point due to increased 2 rewards warehouse ancillary and other businesses positively impacted gross margin by 29 basis points predominantly gasoline partially offset by ecommerce gross margin was positively impacted by five basis points due to the net impact of ceasing incremental wages related to covid19 and the negative impact of a onetime charge related to granting our employees one additional day of paid time off changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 176 compared to 2021 primarily attributable to our other international operations 

the gross margin in core merchandise categories when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales rather than total net sales decreased 27 basis points the decrease was across all categories most significantly in fresh foods this measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses 

gross margin on a segment basis when expressed as a percentage of the segments own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales segment gross margin percentage decreased across all segments all segments were negatively impacted due to decreases in core merchandise categories partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margin in our us segment was also negatively impacted by the lifo charge our other international segment was negatively impacted by increased 2 rewards all segments benefited from the ceasing of incremental wages related to covid19

interest income and other net 



the increase in interest income in 2022 was primarily due to higher global interest rates foreigncurrency transaction gains net include revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our canadian and other international operations and marktomarket adjustments for forward foreignexchange contracts see derivatives and foreign currency sections in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the opinion of management we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates for further information on significant accounting policies see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

insuranceselfinsurance liabilities 

claims for employee healthcare benefits workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors’ and officers’ liability vehicle liability inventory loss and other exposures are funded predominantly through selfinsurance insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to seek to limit exposures arising from very large losses we use different risk management mechanisms including a whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary and participate in a reinsurance program liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated by using historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates regulatory or legal changes and unforeseen developments in claims while we believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material 

recent accounting pronouncements 

we do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements 




 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in millions 

our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents as defined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report as well as shortterm investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields the majority of our shortterm investments are in fixed interestrate securities these securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations 

our policy limits investments in the us to direct us government and government agency obligations repurchase agreements collateralized by us government and government agency obligations us government and government agency money market funds and insured bank balances our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary invests in us government and government agency obligations and us government and government agency money market funds our canadian and other international subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds bankers’ acceptances and bank certificates of deposit generally denominated in local currencies 

a 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2022 would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value for those investments that are classified as availableforsale the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets 

the nature and amount of our longterm debt may vary as a result of business requirements market conditions and other factors as of the end of 2022 longterm debt with fixed interest rates was 6590 fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixedrate debt see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for more information on our longterm debt 

foreign currency risk 

our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in nonfunctional currencies which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates we manage these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreignexchange contracts seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a nonfunctional foreigncurrency the contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries we seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions for additional information related to the companys forward foreignexchange contracts see notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the functional currency compared to the nonfunctional currency exchange rates at august 28 2022 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by 128 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy particularly electricity and natural gas and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing operations which we seek to partially mitigate through fixedprice contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities predominantly in the us and canada we also enter into variablepriced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas in addition to some of the fuel for our gas stations on an index basis these contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no marktomarket adjustment

general 

we operate membership warehouses and ecommerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationallybranded and privatelabel products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins net sales less merchandise costs than most other retailers we generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it even while taking advantage of early payment discounts 

we buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to crossdocking consolidation points depots or directly to our warehouses our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses this process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies lowering costs associated with traditional multiplestep distribution channels for our e 

commerce operations we ship merchandise through our depots our logistics operations for big and bulky items as well as through dropship and other delivery arrangements with our suppliers 

our average warehouse space is approximately 146000 square feet with newer units being slightly larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices our warehouses are not elaborate by strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format we believe our inventory losses shrinkage are well below those of typical retail operations 

our warehouses on average operate on a sevenday 70hour week gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities reducing labor required in general with variations by country our warehouses accept certain credit cards including costco cobranded cards debit cards cash and checks cobrand cardholder rebates executive member 2 reward certificates and our proprietary storedvalue card shop card 

our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of highquality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere we seek to limit most items to fastselling models sizes and colors we carry less than 4000 active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business significantly less than other broadline retailers we average anywhere from 9000 to 11000 skus online some of which are also available in our warehouses many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise on certain electronic items we typically have a 90day return policy and provide free of charge technical support services as well as an extended warranty additional thirdparty warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items 

we offer merchandise and services in the following categories 

core merchandise categories or core business 

• foods and sundries including sundries dry grocery candy cooler freezer deli liquor and tobacco 

• nonfoods previously hardlines and softlines including major appliances electronics health and beauty aids hardware garden and patio sporting goods tires toys and seasonal office supplies automotive care postage tickets apparel small appliances furniture domestics housewares special order kiosk and jewelry 

• fresh foods including meat produce service deli and bakery 

warehouse ancillary includes gasoline pharmacy optical food court hearing aids and tire installation and other businesses includes ecommerce business centers travel and other 

warehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses encouraging members to shop more frequently the number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country and we have no gasoline business in korea or china we operated 636 gas stations at the end of 2021 net sales for our gasoline business represented approximately 9 of total net sales in 2021 

our other businesses sell products and services that complement our warehouse operations core and warehouse ancillary businesses our ecommerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services net sales for ecommerce represented approximately 7 of total net sales in 2021 this figure does not consider other services we offer online in certain countries such as business delivery travel sameday grocery and various other services our business centers carry items tailored specifically for food services convenience stores and offices and offer walkin shopping and deliveries business centers are included in our total warehouse count costco travel offers vacation 

packages hotels cruises and other travel products exclusively for costco members offered in the us canada and the uk 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of brandname merchandise we do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier the covid19 pandemic created unprecedented supply constraints including disruptions and delays that have impacted and could continue to impact the flow and availability of certain products when sources of supply become unavailable we seek alternative sources we also purchase and manufacture privatelabel merchandise as long as quality and member demand are high and the value to our members is significant 

certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

membership 

our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and websites gold star memberships are available to individuals business memberships are limited to businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or comparable document business members may add additional cardholders affiliates to which the same annual fee applies affiliates are not available for gold star members our annual fee for these memberships is 60 in our us and canadian operations and varies in other countries all paid memberships include a free household card 

our member renewal rate was 91 in the us and canada and 89 worldwide at the end of 2021 the majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date at the end of 2020 we standardized our membership count methodology globally to be consistent with the us and canada which resulted in the addition to the count of approximately 20 million total cardholders for 2020 of which 13 million were paid members the change did not impact 2019 membership fee income and the renewal rate calculations were not affected our membership was made up of the following in thousands 



paid cardholders except affiliates are eligible to upgrade to an executive membership in the us and canada for an additional annual fee of 60 executive memberships are also available in mexico the uk japan korea and taiwan for which the additional annual fee varies executive members earn a 2 reward on qualified purchases generally up to a maximum reward of 1000 per year which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses this program also offers except in mexico and korea access to additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services such as auto and home insurance the costco auto purchase program and check printing these services are generally provided by third parties and vary by state and country executive members totaled 256 million and represented 55 of paid members excluding affiliates in the us and canada and 17 of paid members excluding affiliates in our other international operations at the end of 2021 they generally shop more frequently and spend more than other members 

human capital 

our code of ethics requires that we “take care of our employees” which is fundamental to the obligation to “take care of our members” we must also carefully control our selling general and administrative sga expenses so that we can sell high quality goods and services at low prices compensation and benefits for employees is our largest expense after the cost of merchandise and is carefully monitored 

at the end of 2021 we employed 288000 employees worldwide the large majority approximately 95 is employed in our membership warehouses and distribution channels and approximately 17000 employees are represented by unions we also utilize seasonal employees during peak periods the total number of employees by segment is 



we believe that our warehouses are among the most productive in the retail industry owing in substantial part to the commitment and efficiency of our employees we seek to provide them not merely with employment but careers many attributes of our business contribute to the objective the more significant include competitive compensation and benefits for those working in our membership warehouses and distributions channels a commitment to promoting from within and maintaining a ratio of at least 50 of our employee base being fulltime employees these attributes contribute to what we consider especially for the industry a high retention rate in 2021 in the us that rate was above 90 for employees who have been with us for at least one year 

the commitment to “take care of our employees” is also the foundation of our approach to diversity equity and inclusion and creating an inclusive and respectful workplace in 2021 we added training and communication for managers on topics of race bias and equity and greater visibility of our employee demographics embracing differences is important to the growth of our company it leads to more opportunities innovation and employee satisfaction and connects us to the communities where we do business 

costco is firmly committed to helping protect the health and safety of our members and employees and to serving our communities in response to the covid19 pandemic and its associated challenges we began providing premium pay to the majority of our hourly employees in march 2020 and continued for a full year through february 2021 at which time a portion of the premium was built permanently into our hourly wage scales in the us in fall 2020 we also began offering employees additional paid time off to attend to child care and schooling needs through the 2021 school year as the global effect of coronavirus covid19 continues to evolve we are closely monitoring the changing situation and complying with public health guidance

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection location convenience distribution strategy and customer service we compete on a worldwide basis with global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenters internet retailers gasoline stations hard discounters department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise walmart target kroger and amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors in the us we also compete with other warehouse clubs including walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club and many of the major metropolitan areas in the us and certain of our other international locations have multiple clubs 

intellectual property 

we believe that to varying degrees our trademarks trade names copyrights proprietary processes trade secrets trade dress domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success we have invested significantly in the development and protection of our wellrecognized brands including the costco wholesale trademarks and our privatelabel brand kirkland signature we believe that kirkland signature products are high quality offered at prices that are generally lower than national brands and help lower costs differentiate our merchandise offerings and generally earn higher margins we expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our privatelabel items 

we rely on trademark and copyright laws tradesecret protection and confidentiality license and other agreements with our suppliers employees and others to protect our intellectual property the availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained

 item 1a—risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial these risk factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with management  s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this report 

business and operating risks 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our us and canadian operations 

our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our us and canadian operations which comprised 86 and 81 of net sales and operating income in 2021 respectively within the us we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 28 of us net sales in 2021 our california market in general has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our us operations particularly in california and our canadian operations could arise from among other things slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales comparable sales negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor healthcare and energy costs failing to meet targets for warehouse openings cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products 

we may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets and integrating acquisitions which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth is dependent in part on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing leasing and operating warehouses and depots we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms in addition certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability 

we seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance member traffic and profitability 

we intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us attracting members of other wholesale club operators our lesser familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence we cannot ensure that new warehouses and new ecommerce websites will be profitable and future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

we have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed accuracy and efficiency of our supply chains and delivery channels the effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than opening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return 

our failure to maintain membership growth loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations 

membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of executive membership and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable sales diminish member trust and reduce renewal rates and accordingly net sales and membership fee revenue negatively impacting our results of operations 

we sell many products under our kirkland signature brand maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty these products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales if the kirkland signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected 

disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing packaging manufacturing and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction 

we depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process primarily through our depots we also rely upon processing packaging manufacturing and other facilities to support our business which includes the production of certain privatelabel items although we believe that our operations are efficient disruptions due to fires tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes pandemics or other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members our ecommerce business depends heavily on thirdparty and inhouse logistics providers and that business is negatively affected when these providers are unable to provide services in a timely fashion 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire our success depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including those relating to environmental social and governance practices and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly we may have excess inventory which could result in additional markdowns or we may experience outofstock positions and delivery delays which could result in higher costs both of which would reduce our operating performance this could have an adverse effect on net sales gross margin and operating income 

availability and performance of our information technology it systems are vital to our business failure to successfully execute it projects and have it systems available to our business would adversely impact our operations 

it systems play a crucial role in conducting our business these systems are utilized to process a very high volume of transactions conduct payment transactions track and value our inventory and produce reports critical for making business decisions failure or disruption of these systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to buy products and services from our suppliers produce goods in our manufacturing plants move the products in an efficient manner to our warehouses and sell products to our members we are undertaking large technology and it transformation projects the failure of these 

projects could adversely impact our business plans and potentially impair our day to day business operations given the high volume of transactions we process it is important that we build strong digital resiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages computer and telecommunications failures viruses internal or external security breaches errors by employees and catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes any debilitating failure of our critical it systems data centers and backup systems would require significant investments in resources to restore it services and may cause serious impairment in our business operations including loss of business services increased cost of moving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members we are currently making substantial investments in maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency and failure or delay in these projects could be costly and harmful to our business failure to deliver it transformation efforts efficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst multiplying threat landscapes and in compliance with privacy and data protection regulations globally failure to do so could damage our business including our reputation with members suppliers and employees cause us to incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and regulatory action 

increased security threats and more sophisticated cyber misconduct pose a risk to our systems networks products and services we rely upon it systems and networks some of which are managed by third parties in connection with virtually all of our business activities additionally we collect store and process sensitive information relating to our business members suppliers and employees operating these it systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data in a secure manner is critical to our business operations and strategy increased remote work due to the covid19 pandemic has also increased the possible attack surfaces threats designed to gain unauthorized access to systems networks and data both ours and third parties with whom we work are increasing in frequency and sophistication cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crimes and advanced persistent threats phishing attacks have emerged as particularly prominent including as vectors for ransomware attacks which have increased in breadth and frequency while we train our employees as part of our security efforts that training cannot be completely effective these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality integrity and availability of our data it is possible that our it systems and networks or those managed by third parties such as cloud providers or suppliers that otherwise host confidential information could have vulnerabilities which could go unnoticed for a period of time while our cybersecurity and compliance efforts seek to mitigate such risks there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we and our thirdparty service providers have implemented and are implementing will be sufficient to protect our systems information or other property 

the potential impacts of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage litigation government enforcement actions penalties disruption to systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information corruption of data diminution in the value of our investment in it systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs this could adversely affect our competitiveness results of operations and financial condition and critically in light of our business model loss of member confidence further the insurance coverage we maintain and indemnification arrangements with thirdparties may be inadequate to cover claims costs and liabilities relating to cybersecurity incidents in addition data we collect store and process is subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations such as the european unions general data protection regulation california consumer privacy act health insurance portability and accountability act and other emerging privacy and cybersecurity laws across the various states and around the globe which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including select credit and debit cards cash and checks cobrand cardholder rebates executive member 2 reward certificates and our shop card as we offer new payment options to our members we may be subject to additional rules regulations compliance requirements and higher fraud losses for certain payment methods we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees along with additional transaction processing fees we rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card it could disrupt our business if these parties become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers for example we are subject to payment card industry data security standards which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of individual cardholder data if our internal systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card reissuance costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members harm to our reputation and expose us to litigation 

if our merchandise including food and prepared food products for human consumption drugs children  s products pet products and durable goods do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety or labeling standards or our members  expectations we could experience lost sales increased costs litigation or reputational harm the sale of these items involves the risk of illness or injury to our members such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects substances chemicals other agents or residues introduced during the growing manufacturing storage handling and transportation phases or faulty design our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with safety and other standards while we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause illness or injury or that we will not be subject to claims lawsuits or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be longterm 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors our members are increasingly using mobile phones tablets computers and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media particularly in the wake of covid19 we are making investments in our websites and mobile applications if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant memberfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

inability to attract train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends on the continued contributions of our employees including members of our senior management and other key operations it merchandising and administrative personnel failure to identify and implement a succession plan for senior management could negatively impact our business we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors including the continuing impacts of the pandemic regulatory changes prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur property casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance 

claims for employee health care benefits workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors’ and officers’ liability vehicle liability inventory loss and other exposures are funded predominantly through selfinsurance insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit exposures arising from very large losses the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements significant claims or events regulatory changes a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any warehouses depots manufacturing or home office facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations 

market and other external risks 

we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for members employees sites products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local regional and national wholesalers and retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries including other warehouseclub operators supermarkets supercenters internet retailers gasoline stations hard discounters department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways including pricing selection and availability services location convenience store hours and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications the evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop which has enhanced competition some competitors have greater financial resources and technology capabilities better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures changes in the retail markets or customer expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

higher energy and gasoline costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs consumer debt levels foreigncurrency exchange rates unsettled financial markets weaknesses in housing and real estate markets reduced consumer confidence changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal 

and tax policies including changes in tax rates duties tariffs or other restrictions sovereign debt crises pandemics and other health crises and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services require a change in product mix or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory additionally actions in various countries particularly china the united states and the united kingdom have raised the cost of many items and created uncertainty with respect to tariff impacts on the costs of some of our merchandise the degree of our exposure is dependent on among other things the type of goods rates imposed and timing of the tariffs the impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases while these potential impacts are uncertain they could have an adverse impact on our results 

prices of certain commodities including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand inflationary pressures labor costs competition market speculation government regulations taxes and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins these factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results general economic conditions can also be affected by events like the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism 

inflationary factors such as increases in merchandise costs may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations if inflation on merchandise increases beyond our ability to control we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years due to among other things the continuing impacts of the pandemic and uncertain economic environment 

suppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards resulting in adverse effects on our business merchandise inventories sales and profit margins 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices as the quantities we require continue to grow we have no assurances of continued supply appropriate pricing or access to new products and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us member demands may lead to outofstock positions causing a loss of sales and profits 

we buy from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new suppliers and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality or more expensive because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited particularly for certain food items the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available 

our suppliers and those they depend upon for materials and services are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity natural disasters extreme weather conditions public health emergencies supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control packaging legal regulatory labor environmental or animal welfare standards these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members this failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands increase costs and otherwise adversely impact our business 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

during 2021 our international operations including canada generated 28 and 36 of our net sales and operating income respectively our international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses and we plan to continue international growth to prepare our consolidated financial statements we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars using current exchange rates future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our canadian and other international operations and have a corresponding adverse periodoverperiod effect on our results of operations as we continue to expand internationally our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase 

a portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold currency fluctuations may increase our merchandise costs and may not be passed on to members consequently fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

natural disasters extreme weather conditions public health emergencies or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

natural disasters and extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes typhoons floods earthquakes wildfires droughts acts of terrorism or violence including active shooter situations energy shortages public health issues including pandemics and quarantines particularly in california or washington state where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located could negatively affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to our properties limitations on store operating hours less frequent visits by members to physical locations the temporary closure of warehouses depots manufacturing or home office facilities the temporary lack of an adequate work force disruptions to our it systems the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses public health issues whether occurring in the us or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or members or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels these events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic continues to affect our business financial condition and results of operations in many respects 

the continuing impacts of the covid19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and volatile and are affecting certain business operations demand for our products and services instock positions costs of doing business availability of labor access to inventory supply chain operations our ability to predict future performance exposure to litigation and our financial performance among other things 

the pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and on our employees members suppliers and other people and entities with which we do business there is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which covid19 will continue to spread and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and business and government shutdowns the pandemic and any preventative or protective actions that governments or we may take may result in business disruption reduced member traffic and reduced sales in certain merchandise categories and increased operating expenses 

the pandemic is continuing to impact the global supply chain with restrictions and limitations on business activities causing disruption and delay which have strained certain domestic and international supply chains and could continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain products member demand for certain products has and may continue to fluctuate as the pandemic progresses and member 

behaviors change which may challenge our ability to anticipate andor adjust inventory levels to meet that demand similarly increased demand for online purchases of products has impacted our fulfillment operations resulting in delays in deliveries and lost sales from being out of stock for certain skus 

failure to appropriately respond or the perception of an inadequate response to evolving events around the pandemic could cause reputational harm to our brand and subject us to lost sales as well as claims from employees members suppliers regulators or other parties additionally a future outbreak of confirmed cases of covid19 in our facilities could result in temporary or sustained workforce shortages or facility closures which would negatively impact our business and results of operations some jurisdictions have taken measures intended to expand the availability of workers compensation or to change the presumptions applicable to workers compensation measures these actions may increase our exposure to claims and increase our costs 

other factors and uncertainties include but are not limited to 

• the severity and duration of the pandemic including future mutations or related variants of the virus in areas in which we operate 

• evolving macroeconomic factors including general economic uncertainty unemployment rates and recessionary pressures

failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our warehouse and ecommerce comparable sales growth rates membership renewal rates new member signups gross margin earnings earnings per share new warehouse openings or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the price of our stock to decline

 item 7—managements discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data 

the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to promote understanding of the results of operations and financial condition mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k this section generally discusses the results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020 for discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2020 compared to 2019 refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our fiscal year 2020 form 10k which was filed with the united states securities and exchange commission sec on october 7 2020 in 2021 we combined the hardlines and softlines merchandise categories into nonfoods this change did not have a material impact on the discussion of our results of operations 

overview 

we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales particularly comparable sales growth net sales includes our core merchandise categories foods and sundries nonfoods and fresh foods warehouse ancillary includes gasoline pharmacy optical food court hearing aids and tire installation and other businesses includes ecommerce business centers travel and other we define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year including remodels relocations and expansions and salesrelated to ecommerce websites operating for more than one year comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit average ticket sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions the higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative sga expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the longterm another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business including the effects of inflation or deflation especially the united states net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread across a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including those with ecommerce operations while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our privatelabel items and through online offerings 

our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices we do not focus in the shortterm on maximizing prices charged but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods – consistently providing the most competitive values our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales gross margin percentage we believe our gasoline business draws members but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our nongasoline business it also has lower sga expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our nongasoline business a higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our nearterm net sales growth generally rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which given the higher sales base negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our sga expenses as a percentage of net sales a decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect additionally actions in various countries particularly china the united states and the united kingdom have created 

uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise the degree of our exposure is dependent on among other things the type of goods rates imposed and timing of the tariffs certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years the impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases while these potential impacts are uncertain they could have an adverse impact on our results 

we also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses as our warehouse base grows available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth the negative aspects of such growth however including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to continue our ecommerce business growth domestically and internationally has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations 

the membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of our executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets 

our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area some significant costs are partially outside our control particularly health care and utility expenses with respect to the compensation of our employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits rather we believe that achieving our longerterm objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business operates on very low margins modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income particularly merchandise costs and selling general and administrative expenses can have substantial impacts on net income 

our operating model is generally the same across our us canadian and other international operating segments see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report certain operations in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales less or no direct membership warehouse competition or lack an ecommerce business 

in discussions of our consolidated operating results we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which are references to the differences between the foreignexchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars for financial reporting purposes this impact of foreignexchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current periods currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current periods average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period 

our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to august 31 references to 2021 2020 and 2019 relate to the 52week fiscal years ended august 29 2021 august 30 2020 and september 1 2019 respectively certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding unless otherwise noted references to net income relate to net income attributable to costco 

highlights for 2021 included 

• we opened 22 new warehouses including 2 relocations 12 net new in the us 4 net new in our canadian segment and 4 new in our other international segment compared to 16 new warehouses including 3 relocations in 2020 

• net sales increased 18 to 192052 driven by a 16 increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2020 and 2021 

• membership fee revenue increased 9 to 3877 driven by signups and upgrades to executive membership 

• gross margin percentage decreased seven basis points driven primarily by a shift in sales penetration from our core merchandise categories to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses 

• sga expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points primarily due to leveraging increased sales and decreased incremental wages related to covid19 

• the effective tax rate in 2021 was 240 compared to 244 in 2020 

• net income increased 25 to 5007 or 1127 per diluted share compared to 4002 or 902 per diluted share in 2020 

• we paid a special cash dividend of 1000 per share in december 2020 and in april 2021 increased the quarterly cash dividend from 070 to 079 per share totaling 5748 

covid19 

during 2021 our sales mix began returning to prepandemic levels this included sales increases in nonfoods and in many of our warehouse ancillary and other businesses certain of which experienced closures or restrictions in 2020 covidrelated supply and logistics constraints have adversely affected some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future 

we paid 515 in incremental wages during 2021 related to covid19 the incremental wage and benefit costs associated with covid19 which began on march 1 2020 and ended on february 28 2021 totaled approximately 825 

effective march 1 2021 we permanently increased wages for hourly and most salaried warehouse employees the estimated annualized pretax cost is approximately 400 additionally in certain areas in the united states governments have mandated or are considering mandating extra pay for classes of employees that include our employees which has and will result in higher costs 

results of operations 

net sales 



 

1 excluding the impact of the revenue recognition standard for the year ended september 1 2019 

net sales 

net sales increased 28832 or 18 during 2021 the improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 16 and sales at new warehouses opened in 2020 and 2021 while sales in all core merchandise categories increased sales were particularly strong in nonfoods sales increases were also strong in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses predominantly ecommerce and gasoline certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years 

changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately 2759 or 169 basis points compared to 2020 attributable to our canadian and other international operations changes in gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by 1636 or 100 basis points compared to 2020 due to a 12 increase in the average price per gallon the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 10 positively impacting net sales by 1469 or 90 basis points 

comparable sales

gross margin 



the gross margin of our core merchandise categories foods and sundries nonfoods and fresh foods when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales rather than total net sales increased 23 basis points this measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses the increase was across all categories most significantly in nonfoods 

total gross margin percentage decreased seven basis points compared to 2020 excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales in 2021 gross margin percentage was 1122 an increase of two basis points this increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories predominantly nonfoods and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses largely ecommerce the comparison was also positively impacted by a three basis point reserve on inventory recorded in 2020 with no such reserve this year gross margin percentage was negatively impacted three basis points due to increased 2 rewards and two basis points due to a lifo charge for higher merchandise costs changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar positively impacted gross margin by approximately 301 in 2021 

gross margin on a segment basis when expressed as a percentage of the segments own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales segment gross margin percentage decreased in our us segment due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses our core merchandise categories and the lifo charge partially offset by the reserve for certain inventory in 2020 our canadian and other international segments increased primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories these increases were partially offset by increased 2 rewards

preopening 



preopening expenses include startup costs for new warehouses and relocations developments in new international markets new manufacturing and distribution facilities and expansions at existing warehouses and corporate facilities preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse and facility openings the timing of the opening relative to our yearend whether the warehouse is owned or leased and whether the opening is in an existing new or international market 

interest expense 



interest expense primarily relates to senior notes for more information on our debt arrangements refer to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report

our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in nonfunctional currencies which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates we manage these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreignexchange contracts seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a nonfunctional foreigncurrency the contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the us dollar we seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions for additional information related to the companys forward foreignexchange contracts see notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the functional currency compared to the nonfunctional currency exchange rates at august 29 2021 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by 149 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy particularly electricity and natural gas and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing operations which we seek to partially mitigate through fixedprice contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities predominantly in the us and canada we also enter into variablepriced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas in addition to some of the fuel for our gas stations on an index basis these contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no marktomarket adjustment

general 

we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationallybranded and privatelabel products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins net sales less merchandise costs than most other retailers we generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it even while taking advantage of early payment discounts 

we buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to crossdocking consolidation points depots or directly to our warehouses our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses this process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies lowering costs associated with traditional multiplestep distribution channels 

our average warehouse space is approximately 146000 square feet with newer units being slightly larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices our warehouses are not elaborate by strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format we believe our inventory losses shrinkage are well below those of typical retail operations 

our warehouses on average operate on a sevenday 70hour week gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities reducing labor required in general with variations by country our warehouses accept certain credit cards including costco cobranded cards debit cards cash and checks cobrand cardholder rebates executive member 2 reward certificates and our proprietary storedvalue card shop card 

our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of highquality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere we seek to limit most items to fastselling models sizes and colors we carry an average of approximately 3700 active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business significantly less than other broadline retailers we average anywhere from 8000 to 10000 skus online some of which are also available in our warehouses many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise on certain electronic items we typically have a 90day return policy and provide free of charge technical support services as well as an extended warranty additional thirdparty warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items 

we offer merchandise in the following categories 

• food and sundries including dry foods packaged foods groceries snack foods candy alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages and cleaning supplies 

• hardlines including major appliances electronics health and beauty aids hardware and garden and patio 

• fresh foods including meat produce deli and bakery 

• softlines including apparel and small appliances 

• ancillary including gasoline and pharmacy businesses 

ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services encouraging members to shop more frequently these businesses include gas stations pharmacies optical dispensing centers food courts and hearingaid centers the number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country and we do not currently operate our gasoline business in korea or china we operated 615 gas stations at the end of 2020 net sales for our gasoline business represented approximately 9 of total net sales in 2020 

our ecommerce operations allow us to connect with our members online and provide additional products and services many not found in our warehouses net sales for ecommerce represented approximately 6 of total net sales in 2020 this figure does not consider other services we offer online in certain countries such as business delivery travel sameday grocery and various other services 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brandname merchandise we do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier the covid19 pandemic created unprecedented supply constraints including disruptions and delays that have impacted and could continue to impact the flow and availability of certain products when sources of supply become unavailable we seek alternative sources we also purchase and manufacture privatelabel merchandise as long as quality and member demand are high and the value to our members is significant 

certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

membership 

our members may utilize their memberships at our warehouses worldwide gold star memberships are available to individuals business memberships are limited to businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or comparable document business members may add additional cardholders affiliates to which the same annual fee applies affiliates are not available for gold star members our annual fee for these memberships is 60 in our us and canadian operations and varies in other countries all paid memberships include a free household card 

our member renewal rate was 91 in the us and canada and 88 on a worldwide basis at the end of 2020 the majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date 

our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date at the end of 2020 we standardized our membership count methodology globally to be consistent with the us and canada which resulted in the addition to the count of approximately 20 million total cardholders for 2020 of which 13 million were paid members the change did not impact 2019 or 2018 membership fee income and the renewal rate calculations were not affected our membership was made up of the following in thousands 



paid cardholders except affiliates are eligible to upgrade to an executive membership in the us and canada for an additional annual fee of 60 executive memberships are also available in mexico the uk japan korea and taiwan for which the additional annual fee varies executive members earn a 2 reward on qualified purchases generally up to a maximum reward of 1000 per year which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses this program also offers except in mexico japan and korea access to additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services such as auto and home insurance the costco auto purchase program and check printing these services are generally provided by third parties and vary by state and country executive members who totaled 226 million and represented 39 of paid members at the end of 2020 generally shop more frequently and spend more than other members 

labor 

our employee count was as follows 



approximately 17100 employees are union employees we consider our employee relations to be very good 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection location convenience distribution strategy and customer service we compete on a worldwide basis with global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenters internet retailers gasoline stations hard discounters department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise walmart target kroger and amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors we also compete with other warehouse clubs primarily walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club and many of the major metropolitan areas in the us and certain of our other international locations have multiple clubs 

intellectual property 

we believe that to varying degrees our trademarks trade names copyrights proprietary processes trade secrets trade dress domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success we have invested significantly in the development and protection of our wellrecognized brands including the costco wholesale ® trademarks and our privatelabel brand kirkland signature ®  we believe that kirkland signature products are high quality offered at prices that are generally lower than national brands and help lower costs differentiate our merchandise offerings and generally earn higher margins we expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our privatelabel items 

we rely on trademark and copyright laws tradesecret protection and confidentiality license and other agreements with our suppliers employees and others to protect our intellectual property the availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained

 item 1a—risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial these risk factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with management  s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this report 

business and operating risks 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our us and canadian operations 

our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our us and canadian operations which comprised 87 and 83 of net sales and operating income in 2020 respectively within the us we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 29 of us net sales in 2020 our california market in general has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our us operations particularly in california and our canadian operations could arise from among other things slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales comparable sales negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor healthcare and energy costs failing to meet targets for warehouse openings cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products 

we may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets and integrating acquisitions which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth is dependent in part on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing leasing and operating warehouses and depots we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms in addition certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability 

we seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance member traffic and profitability 

we intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us attracting members of other wholesale club operators our lesser familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence we cannot ensure that new warehouses and new ecommerce websites will be profitable and as a result future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

we have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed accuracy and efficiency of our supply chains the effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than opening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return 

our failure to maintain membership growth loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations 

membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable sales diminish member trust and reduce renewal rates and accordingly net sales and membership fee revenue negatively impacting our results of operations 

we sell many products under our kirkland signature brand maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty these products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales if the kirkland signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected 

disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing packaging manufacturing and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction 

we depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process primarily through our depots we also rely upon processing packaging manufacturing and other facilities to support our business which includes the production of certain privatelabel items although we believe that our operations are efficient disruptions due to fires tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes pandemics or other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members our ecommerce business depends heavily on thirdparty logistics providers and that business is negatively affected when these providers are unable to provide services in a timely fashion 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire our success depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly we may have excess inventory which could result in additional markdowns or we may experience outofstock positions and delivery delays which could result in higher costs both of which would reduce our operating performance this could have an adverse effect on net sales gross margin and operating income 

availability and performance of our information technology it systems are vital for our business to operate efficiently failure to execute complex it projects and have these it systems available to our business will adversely impact our operations 

it systems play a crucial role in conducting our business on a daily basis these systems are utilized to process a very high volume of transactions conduct payment transactions track and value our inventory and produce reports which are critical for making business decisions on a daily weekly and periodic basis failure or disruption of these it systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to buy products from our suppliers produce goods in our manufacturing plants move the products in an efficient manner to our warehouses and sell products to our members we are undertaking large technology and it transformation projects the failure of these projects could adversely impact our business plans and 

potentially impair our day to day business operations given the high volume of transactions we process it is important that we build strong digital resiliency for our businesscritical systems to prevent disruption from events such as power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches errors by employees and catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes any debilitating failure of our critical it systems data centers and backup systems would require significant investments in resources to restore it services and may cause serious impairment in our business operations including loss of business services increased cost of moving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members we are currently making significant investments in enhancing our digital resiliency and failure or delay in execution of these projects could delay our ability to be resilient to disruptive events failure to deliver our it transformation efforts efficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst evolving threat landscapes and in compliance with emerging privacy and data protection regulations globally failure to meet the requirements could damage our reputation with members suppliers and employees cause us to incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

increased it security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services we rely upon it systems and networks some of which are managed by third parties in connection with a variety of business activities additionally we collect store and process sensitive information relating to our business members suppliers and employees operating these it systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data in a secure manner is critical to our business operations and strategy the increased use of remote work infrastructure due to the covid19 pandemic has also increased the possible attack surfaces security threats designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data are increasing in frequency and sophistication cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crimes and advanced persistent threats these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality integrity and availability of our data it is possible that our it systems and networks or those managed by third parties such as cloud providers could have vulnerabilities which could go unnoticed for a period of time while our cybersecurity and compliance posture seeks to mitigate such risks there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we and our thirdparty service providers have implemented and are implementing will be sufficient to protect our systems information or other property 

the potential impacts of a future material cybersecurity attack includes reputational damage litigation government enforcement actions penalties disruption to systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information corruption of data diminution in the value of our investment in it systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs this could adversely affect our competitiveness results of operations and financial condition and loss of member confidence further the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack in addition data we collect store and process is subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations such as the european unions general data protection regulation california consumer privacy act health insurance portability and accountability act china cybersecurity law and other emerging privacy and cybersecurity laws across the various states and around the globe which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including select credit and debit cards cash and checks cobrand cardholder rebates executive member 2 reward certificates and our shop card as we offer new payment options to our members we may be subject to additional rules regulations compliance requirements and higher fraud losses for certain payment methods we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees along with additional transaction processing fees we rely on third parties to 

provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card it could disrupt our business if these parties become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers for example we are subject to payment card industry data security standards which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of individual cardholder data if our internal systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card reissuance costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members harm to our reputation and expose us to litigation 

if our merchandise including food and prepared food products for human consumption drugs children  s products pet products and durable goods do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members  expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales increased costs litigation or reputational harm the sale of these items involves the risk of illness or injury to our members such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects substances chemicals other agents or residues introduced during the growing manufacturing storage handling and transportation phases or faulty design our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with safety and other standards while we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause illness or injury or that we will not be subject to claims lawsuits or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be longterm 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors our members are increasingly using mobile phones tablets computers and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media particularly in the wake of covid19 we are making investments in our websites and mobile applications if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant memberfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

inability to attract train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends on the continued contributions of our employees including members of our senior management and other key operations it merchandising and administrative personnel failure to identify and implement a succession plan for senior management could negatively impact our business we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors including regulatory changes prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur property casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance 

claims for employee health care benefits workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors’ and officers’ liability vehicle liability inventory loss and other exposures are funded predominantly through selfinsurance insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit exposures arising from very large losses the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements significant claims or events regulatory changes a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any warehouses depots manufacturing or home office facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations 

market and other external risks 

we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for members employees sites products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local regional and national wholesalers and retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries including other warehouseclub operators supermarkets supercenters internet retailers gasoline stations hard discounters department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways including pricing selection and availability services location convenience store hours and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications the evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop which has enhanced competition some competitors may have greater financial resources and technology capabilities better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures changes in the retail markets and customer expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

higher energy and gasoline costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs consumer debt levels foreigncurrency exchange rates unsettled financial markets weaknesses in housing and real estate markets reduced consumer confidence changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal and tax policies including changes in tax rates duties tariffs or other restrictions sovereign debt crises pandemics and other health crises and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services require a change in product mix or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory additionally actions in various countries particularly china and the united states have raised the cost of many items and created uncertainty with respect to tariff impacts on the costs of some of our merchandise the degree of our exposure is dependent on among other things the type of goods rates imposed and timing of the tariffs the impact to our business including net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors while these potential impacts are uncertain they could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

prices of certain commodities including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations taxes and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and 

our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins these factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results general economic conditions can also be affected by events like the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism 

suppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards resulting in adverse effects on our business merchandise inventories sales and profit margins 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices as the quantities we require continue to grow we have no assurances of continued supply appropriate pricing or access to new products and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us member demands may lead to outofstock positions causing a loss of sales and profits 

we buy from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new suppliers and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality or more expensive because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited particularly for certain food items the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available 

our suppliers and those they depend upon for materials and services are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity natural disasters extreme weather conditions public health emergencies supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control legal regulatory labor environmental or animal welfare standards these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members this failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands increase costs and otherwise adversely impact our business 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

during 2020 our international operations including canada generated 27 and 33 of our net sales and operating income respectively our international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses and we plan to continue international growth to prepare our consolidated financial statements we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars using current exchange rates future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our canadian and other international operations and have a corresponding adverse periodoverperiod effect on our results of operations as we continue to expand internationally our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase 

a portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold currency fluctuations may increase our cost of goods and may not be passed on to members consequently fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

natural disasters extreme weather conditions public health emergencies or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

natural disasters and extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes typhoons floods earthquakes acts of terrorism or violence including active shooter situations public health issues including pandemics and quarantines particularly in california or washington state where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located could negatively affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to our properties limitations on store operating hours less frequent visits by members to physical locations the temporary closure of warehouses 

depots manufacturing or home office facilities the temporary lack of an adequate work force disruptions to our it systems the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses public health issues whether occurring in the us or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or members or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels these events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic is affecting our business financial condition and results of operations in many respects 

the continuing impacts of the covid19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and volatile and are affecting certain business operations demand for our products and services instock positions costs of doing business availability of labor access to inventory supply chain operations our ability to predict future performance exposure to litigation and our financial performance among other things 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and on our employees members suppliers and other people and entities with which we do business there is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which covid19 will continue to spread and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and business and government shutdowns we are taking precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees including temporarily requiring some employees to work remotely to reward our employees for exemplary service in difficult times we temporarily increased compensation levels and otherwise incurred increased spending for wages and benefits including overtime pay the pandemic and any preventative or protective actions that governments or we may take are likely to result in a period of business disruption reduced member traffic and reduced sales in certain merchandise categories and increased operating expenses 

the pandemic has significantly impacted the global supply chain with restrictions and limitations on business activities causing disruption and delay these disruptions and delays have strained certain domestic and international supply chains which have affected and could continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain products member demand for certain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed and member behaviors have changed which has challenged our ability to anticipate andor adjust inventory levels to meet that demand these factors have resulted in higher outofstock positions in certain products as well as delays in delivering those products even if we are able to find alternate sources for certain products they may cost more or require us to incur higher transportation costs adversely impacting our profitability and financial condition similarly increased demand for online purchases of products has impacted our fulfillment operations resulting in delays in delivering products to members 

if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic or if our members do not participate in social distancing and other safety measures the wellbeing of our employees and members could be at risk and a failure to appropriately respond or the perception of an inadequate response could cause reputational harm to our brand and subject us to lost sales and claims from employees members suppliers regulators or other parties additionally a future outbreak of confirmed cases of covid19 in our facilities could result in temporary or sustained workforce shortages or facility closures which would negatively impact our business and results of operations some jurisdictions have taken measures intended to expand the availability of workers compensation or to change the presumptions applicable to workers compensation measures these actions may increase our exposure to claims and increase our costs 

in an effort to strengthen our liquidity position during the year we issued 4000 million senior notes a portion of which was used to repay prior to maturity 1500 million of our 2150 and 2250 senior notes financial and credit markets have experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility and turmoil our continued access to external sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings if the impacts of the pandemic continue to disrupt the financial markets or if rating agencies lower our credit ratings it could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt or other sources of external liquidity if needed 

other factors and uncertainties include but are not limited to 

• the severity and duration of the pandemic including whether there is a “second wave” caused by additional periods of increases or spikes in the number of covid19 cases future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we operate 

• evolving macroeconomic factors including general economic uncertainty unemployment rates and recessionary pressures 

• unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response 

• the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides and 

• the longterm impact of the pandemic on our business including consumer behaviors 

to the extent that covid19 continues to adversely affect the us and global economy our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition it may also heighten other risks described in this section including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations competition brand reputation implementation of strategic initiatives cybersecurity threats paymentrelated risks technology systems disruption supply chain disruptions labor availability and cost litigation operational risk as a result of remote work arrangements and regulatory requirements 

factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs and other regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability climate change extreme weather conditions and rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience we also sell a substantial amount of gasoline the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which face increased regulation 

failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our warehouse and ecommerce comparable sales growth rates membership renewal rates new member signups gross margin earnings earnings per share new warehouse openings or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

at the end of 2020 we operated 243 warehouses outside of the us and we plan to continue expanding our international operations future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many similar to those we face in the us certain of which are beyond our control 

these factors include political and economic conditions regulatory constraints currency regulations policy changes such as the withdrawal of the uk from the european union and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade including tariffs and trade sanctions monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the us and foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the us risks inherent in international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights 

we are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires management assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures our ability to record process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 

accounting principles and related pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including selfinsurance liabilities are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

we could be subject to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions additionally at any point in time we may be under examination for value added salesbased payroll product import or other nonincome taxes we may recognize additional tax expense be subject to additional tax liabilities or incur losses and penalties due to changes in laws regulations administrative practices principles assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax including tax rules in various jurisdictions we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate as tax rates vary among countries a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision additionally changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits including transfer pricing disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

significant changes in or failure to comply with regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to a wide and increasingly broad array of federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters failure to comply with these laws could result in harm to our members employees or others significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance remediation or compensatory requirements or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

operations at our facilities require the treatment and disposal of wastewater stormwater and agricultural and food processing wastes the use and maintenance of refrigeration systems including ammoniabased chillers noise odor and dust management the operation of mechanized processing equipment and other operations that potentially could affect the environment and public health and safety failure to comply with current and future environmental health and safety standards could result in the imposition of fines and penalties illness or injury of our employees and claims or lawsuits related to such illnesses or injuries and temporary closures or limits on the operations of facilities 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards fines penalties and remediation costs we are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits including grand jury investigations government and agency investigations and consumer employment tort unclaimed property laws and other litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these proceedings and other contingencies including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities the outcome of some of these proceedings audits unclaimed property laws and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management  s attention and resources

 item 7—managements discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data 

overview 

we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales particularly comparable sales growth net sales includes our core merchandise categories food and sundries hardlines softlines and fresh foods warehouse ancillary and other businesses we define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year including remodels relocations and expansions and sales related to ecommerce websites operating for more than one year comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit average ticket sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions primarily impacting our us and canadian operations the higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative sga expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the longterm another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business including the effects of inflation or deflation especially the united states net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread across a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including those with ecommerce operations while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our privatelabel items and through online offerings 

our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices we do not focus in the shortterm on maximizing prices charged but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods – consistently providing the most competitive values our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales gross margin percentage we believe our gasoline business draws members but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our nongasoline business it also has lower sga expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our nongasoline business a higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our nearterm net sales growth generally rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which given the higher sales base negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our sga expenses as a percentage of net sales a decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect additionally actions in various countries particularly china and the united states have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise the degree of our exposure is dependent on among other things the type of goods rates imposed and timing of the tariffs the impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases while these potential impacts are uncertain they could have an adverse impact on our results 

we also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses as our warehouse base grows available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth the negative aspects of such growth however including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to 

continue our ecommerce business growth domestically and internationally has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse business 

the membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of our executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets 

our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area some significant costs are partially outside our control particularly health care and utility expenses with respect to the compensation of our employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits rather we believe that achieving our longerterm objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business operates on very low margins modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income particularly merchandise costs and selling general and administrative expenses can have substantial impacts on net income 

our operating model is generally the same across our us canada and other international operating segments see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report certain countries in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales less or no direct membership warehouse competition and may lack an ecommerce business 

in discussions of our consolidated operating results we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which are references to the differences between the foreignexchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars for financial reporting purposes this impact of foreignexchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current periods currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current periods average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period 

our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to august 31 references to 2020 2019 and 2018 relate to the 52week fiscal years ended august 30 2020 september 1 2019 and september 2 2018 respectively certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding unless otherwise noted references to net income relate to net income attributable to costco 

for discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2019 compared to 2018 refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our fiscal year 2019 form 10k which was filed with the united states securities and exchange commission on october 11 2019 

highlights for 2020 included

• net sales increased 9 to 163220 driven by a 8 increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2019 and 2020 

• membership fee revenue increased 6 to 3541 primarily due to membership signups at existing and new warehouses 

• gross margin percentage increased 18 basis points driven primarily by certain core merchandise categories partially offset by certain ancillary and other businesses which were negatively impacted by covid19 related closures or restrictions 

• sga expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased three basis points primarily due to leveraging increased sales and partial reversal of a previous year tax assessment these benefits were partially offset by incremental wage and sanitation costs as a result of covid19 

• the effective tax rate in 2020 was 244 compared to 223 in 2019 

• net income increased 9 to 4002 or 902 per diluted share compared to 3659 or 826 per diluted share in 2019 

• in february 2020 we acquired a 35 interest in navitus health solutions a pharmacy benefit manager in march 2020 we acquired innovel solutions a company that provides finalmile delivery installation and whiteglove capabilities for big and bulky products across the united states and puerto rico 

• in april 2020 we issued 4000 in aggregate principal amount of senior notes some proceeds of which were used to repay 1500 of senior notes and 

• in april 2020 the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from 065 to 070 per share 

covid19 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization announced that covid19 infections had become a pandemic and shortly afterward the us declared a national emergency the outbreak has led to widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and is affecting many aspects of our business and the operations of others with which we do business in our response to the pandemic and in an effort to protect our members and employees we have taken several measures as described in item 1a risk factors and their implications on our results of operations have impacted us across all our reportable segments to varying degrees throughout the pandemic our warehouses have largely remained open as a result of being deemed an “essential business” in most markets and resulted in strong sales increases in our food and sundries and fresh foods merchandise categories compared to prepandemic time periods this growth in certain of our core business categories has led to improved gross margin and sga percentages as we leveraged these sales to achieve greater efficiency our ecommerce business has also benefited as more members have shopped online during the pandemic conversely we have experienced decreases in both the sales and profitability of many of our ancillary and other businesses due to temporary closures or limited demand additionally we paid 564 in incremental wage and sanitation costs during 2020 related to covid19 

results of operations 

net sales 



 

1 excluding the impact of the revenue recognition standard for the year ended september 1 2019 

net sales 

net sales increased 13869 or 9 during 2020 primarily due to an 8 increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2019 and 2020 during the second half of 2020 we experienced a significant sales shift from certain of our ancillary and other businesses to our core merchandise categories primarily food and sundries and fresh foods as a result of covid19 this shift was largely driven by price deflation and lower volume in our gasoline business temporary closures of most of our optical hearing aid and photo departments limited service in our food courts and minimal demand in our travel business 

changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by 1504 or 101 basis points compared to 2019 due to a 10 decrease in the average price per gallon the volume of gasoline sold decreased approximately 4 negatively impacting net sales by 699 or 47 basis points changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately 663 or 44 basis points compared to 2019 attributable to our canadian and other international operations 

comparable sales 

comparable sales increased 8 during 2020 and were positively impacted by increases in average ticket while traffic increased slightly in 2020 it decreased in the second half of the year due to capacity restrictions and regulations related to covid19 there was an increase of 50 in ecommerce comparable sales in 2020 with an increase of 80 in the second half of the year 

membership fees 



the increase in membership fees was primarily due to membership signups at existing and new warehouses at the end of 2020 our member renewal rates were 91 in the us and canada and 88 worldwide our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date 

we account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis recognized ratably over the oneyear membership period our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date 

gross margin 



the gross margin of our core merchandise categories food and sundries hardlines softlines and fresh foods when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales rather than total net sales increased 16 basis points primarily due to increases in fresh foods and softlines partially offset by a decrease in hardlines this measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses fresh foods gross margin increased as a result of efficiencies from increased sales partially offset by operating losses from our poultry complex 

total gross margin percentage increased 18 basis points compared to 2019 excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales gross margin percentage was 1110 an increase of eight basis points this increase was primarily due to a 32 basis point increase in our core merchandise categories predominantly fresh foods and food and sundries partially offset by a decrease in softlines and hardlines this increase was also positively impacted by our cobranded credit card program which included an adjustment in 2019 to our estimate of breakage on rewards earned these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 14 basis points in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses predominantly certain ancillary businesses that were negatively impacted by covid19 related closures or restrictions however certain of our ancillary and other businesses such as tire shop gasoline and ecommerce businesses did improve gross margin was also negatively impacted by incremental wage and sanitation costs related to covid19 of six basis points a reserve for certain inventory of three basis points and increased spending by members under the executive membership 2 reward program of one basis point changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 68 in 2020 

gross margin on a segment basis when expressed as a percentage of the segments own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales segment gross margin percentage was impacted by increases in fresh foods and food and sundries and decreases in softlines and hardlines in each of our us canadian and other international segments each of our segments were also negatively impacted by the incremental wage and sanitation costs as a result of covid19 the segment gross margin percentage increased in our us operations predominantly in our core merchandise categories which includes the impact from our cobranded credit card program as discussed above 

partially offset by certain ancillary businesses that were negatively impacted by covid19 related closures or restrictions our canadian segment gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to certain of our warehouse ancillary and other businesses that were negatively impacted by covid19 related closures or restrictions the segment gross margin percentage increased in our other international operations primarily due to core merchandise categories as discussed above and was also positively impacted by certain warehouse ancillary and other businesses predominantly ecommerce these increases were partially offset by increased spending by members under the executive membership 2 reward program 

selling general and administrative expenses 



sga expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased three basis points compared to 2019 sga expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation was 991 a decrease of 13 basis points sga expenses were negatively impacted by approximately 456 or 28 basis points due to incremental wage and sanitation costs as a result of covid19 and approximately 24 or one basis point due to costs associated with the acquisition of innovel see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements operating costs related to warehouse operations and other businesses which include ecommerce and travel were lower by 26 basis points primarily due to leveraging increased sales sga expenses were also benefited by 13 basis points related to a product tax assessment charge in 2019 which was partially reversed in 2020 stock compensation was lower by two basis points and central operating costs were lower by one basis point our canadian segment sga percentage was higher compared to 2019 due primarily to the incremental wage and sanitation costs related to covid as outlined above changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar positively impacted sga expenses by approximately 58 

preopening 



preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses and relocations developments in new international markets new manufacturing and distribution facilities and expansions at existing warehouses preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse and facility openings the timing of the opening relative to our yearend whether a warehouse is owned or leased and whether openings are in an existing new or international market in 2020 operations commenced at our new poultry processing plant and in 2019 we opened our first warehouse in china 

interest expense

april 2020 we issued 4000 in aggregate principal amount of longterm debt consisting of  1250 of 1375  senior notes due june 2027  1750 of 1600  senior notes due april 2030 and  1000 of 1750  senior notes due april 2032 a portion of the proceeds was used to repay prior to maturity 1000 and 500 of the 2150 and 2250 senior notes for more information on our debt arrangements refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

interest income and other net 



the decrease in interest income in 2020 was primarily due to lower interest rates in the us and canada partially offset by higher average cash and investment balances foreigncurrency transaction gains net include the revaluation and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities and marktomarket adjustments for forward foreignexchange contracts by our canadian and other international operations see derivatives and foreign currency sections in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements other net was impacted by a 36 charge related to the repayment of certain senior notes as discussed above and in note 5  

provision for income taxes 



the effective tax rate for 2020 included discrete net tax benefits of 81 including a benefit of 77 due to excess tax benefits from stock compensation excluding these benefits the tax rate was 259 for 2020 

the effective tax rate for 2019 included discrete net tax benefits of 221 including a benefit of 59 due to excess tax benefits from stock compensation this also included a tax benefit of 105 related to us taxation of deemed foreign dividends offset by losses of foreign tax credits which impacted the effective tax rate excluding these benefits the tax rate was 269 for 2019

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the opinion of management we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates for further information on significant accounting policies see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

insuranceselfinsurance liabilities 

claims for employee healthcare benefits workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors’ and officers’ liability vehicle liability inventory loss and other exposures are funded predominantly through selfinsurance insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to seek to limit exposures arising from very large losses we use different risk management mechanisms including a whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary and participate in a reinsurance program liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated by using historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates regulatory or legal changes and unforeseen developments in claims over time while we believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material

 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in millions 

our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents as defined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report as well as shortterm investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields the majority of our shortterm investments are in fixed interestrate securities these securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations 

our policy limits investments in the us to direct us government and government agency obligations repurchase agreements collateralized by us government and government agency obligations us government and government agency money market funds and insured bank balances our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary invests in us government and government agency obligations and us government and government agency money market funds our canadian and other international subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds bankers’ acceptances and bank certificates of deposit generally denominated in local currencies 

a 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2020 would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value for those investments that are classified as availableforsale the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets 

the nature and amount of our longterm debt may vary as a result of business requirements market conditions and other factors as of the end of 2020 longterm debt with fixed interest rates was 7657 fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixedrate debt see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for more information on our longterm debt 

foreign currency risk 

our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in nonfunctional currencies which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates we manage these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreignexchange contracts seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a nonfunctional foreigncurrency the contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the us dollar we seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions for additional information related to the companys forward foreignexchange contracts see notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the functional currency compared to the nonfunctional currency exchange rates at august 30 2020 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by 111 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy particularly electricity and natural gas and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing operations which we seek to partially mitigate through fixedprice contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities predominantly in the us and canada we also enter into variablepriced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas in addition to some of the fuel for our gas stations on an index basis these contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no marktomarket adjustment

 item 1—business 

costco wholesale corporation and its subsidiaries costco or the company began operations in 1983 in seattle washington we are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the united states us and puerto rico canada united kingdom uk mexico japan korea australia spain france iceland china and through a majorityowned subsidiary in taiwan costco operated 782  762  and 741  warehouses worldwide at september 1 2019  september 2 2018  and september 3 2017  respectively our common stock trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “cost” 

we report on a 5253week fiscal year consisting of thirteen fourweek periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august the first three quarters consist of three periods each and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53week year the material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season references to 2019  and 2018  relate to the 52week fiscal years ended september 1 2019  and september 2 2018  respectively references to 2017  relate to the 53week fiscal year ended september 3 2017  

general 

we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and privatelabel products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins net sales less merchandise costs than most other retailers we generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it even while taking advantage of early payment discounts 

we buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to crossdocking consolidation points depots or directly to our warehouses our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses this process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies lowering costs associated with traditional multiplestep distribution channels 

our average warehouse space is approximately 146000  square feet with newer units being slightly larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise 

and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices our warehouses are not elaborate by strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format we believe our inventory losses shrinkage are well below those of typical retail operations 

our warehouses on average operate on a sevenday 70hour week gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities reducing labor required in general with variations by country our warehouses accept certain credit cards including costco cobranded cards debit cards cash checks and our proprietary storedvalue card shop card 

our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of highquality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere we seek to limit items to fastselling models sizes and colors we carry an average of approximately 3700  active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business significantly less than other broadline retailers many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise on certain electronic items we typically have a 90day return policy and provide free of charge technical support services as well as an extended warranty additional thirdparty warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items 

we offer merchandise in the following categories 

 ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services encouraging members to shop more frequently these businesses include gas stations pharmacies optical dispensing centers food courts and hearingaid centers the number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country and we do not currently operate our gasoline business in korea france or china we operated 593  gas stations at the end of 2019  net sales for our gasoline business represented approximately 11 of total net sales in 2019 

our ecommerce operations allow us to connect with our members online and provide additional products and services many not found in our warehouses at the end of 2019 we operated ecommerce websites in the us canada mexico uk korea and taiwan net sales for ecommerce represented approximately 4  of total net sales in 2019  additionally we offer business delivery travel and various other services online in certain countries 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brandname merchandise we do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier we generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if current sources of supply became unavailable we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business we also purchase and manufacture privatelabel merchandise as long as quality and member demand are high and the value to our members is significant 

certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in note 11  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

membership 

our members may utilize their memberships at our warehouses worldwide gold star memberships are available to individuals business memberships are limited to businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or comparable document business members may add additional cardholders affiliates to which the same annual fee applies affiliates are not available for gold star members our annual fee for these memberships is 60 in our us and canadian operations and varies in other countries all paid memberships include a free household card 

our member renewal rate was 91  in the us and canada and 88  on a worldwide basis at the end of 2019  the majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date 

our membership was made up of the following in thousands 



paid cardholders except affiliates are eligible to upgrade to an executive membership in the us and canada for an additional annual fee of 60 executive memberships are also available in mexico the uk and korea for which the additional annual fee varies executive members earn a 2 reward on qualified purchases up to a maximum reward of 1000 per year in the us and canada and varies in mexico the uk and korea which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses this program also offers except in mexico and korea access to additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services such as auto and home insurance the costco auto purchase program and check printing these services are generally provided by third parties and vary by state and country executive members who represented 39  of paid members at the end of 2019  generally shop more frequently and spend more than other members 

labor 

our employee count was as follows 



approximately 16000  employees are union employees we consider our employee relations to be very good 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection location convenience distribution strategy and customer service we compete on a worldwide basis with global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenters internet retailers gasoline stations hard discounters department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise walmart target kroger and amazoncom are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors we also compete with other warehouse clubs primarily walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club and many of the major metropolitan areas in the us and certain of our other international locations have multiple club operations 

intellectual property 

we believe that to varying degrees our trademarks trade names copyrights proprietary processes trade secrets trade dress domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success we have invested significantly in the development and protection of our wellrecognized brands including the costco wholesale ®  trademarks and our privatelabel brand kirkland signature ®  we believe that kirkland signature products are high quality offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than national brands and that they help lower costs differentiate our merchandise offerings and generally earn higher margins we expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our privatelabel items 

we rely on trademark and copyright laws tradesecret protection and confidentiality license and other agreements with our suppliers employees and others to protect our intellectual property the availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained

 item 1a—risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial these risk factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with management  s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7  and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8  of this report 

business and operating risks 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our us and canadian operations 

our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our us and canadian operations which comprised 87  and 84  of net sales and operating income in 2019  respectively within the us we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 30  of us net sales in 2019  our california market in general has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our us operations particularly in california and our canadian operations could arise from among other things slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales comparable sales negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor healthcare and energy costs failing to meet targets for warehouse openings cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products 

we may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth is dependent in part on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing leasing and operating warehouses and depots we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms in addition certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability 

we seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance member traffic and profitability 

we intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets including china associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us attracting members of other wholesale club operators our lesser familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence we cannot ensure that new warehouses and new ecommerce websites will be profitable and as a result future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

our failure to maintain membership growth loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations 

membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable sales diminish member trust and reduce renewal rates and accordingly net sales and membership fee revenue negatively impacting our results of operations 

we sell many products under our kirkland signature brand maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty these products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products carried in our warehouses and represent a growing portion of our overall sales if the kirkland signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected 

disruptions in our merchandise distribution or processing packaging manufacturing and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction 

we depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process primarily through our depots we also rely upon processing packaging manufacturing and other facilities to support our business which includes the production of certain privatelabel items although we believe that our operations are efficient disruptions due to fires tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes or other catastrophic events labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire our success depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly we may have excess inventory which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance this could have an adverse effect on net sales gross margin and operating income 

we rely extensively on information technology to process transactions compile results and manage our business failure or disruption of our primary and backup systems could adversely affect our business a failure to adequately update our existing systems and implement new systems could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations 

given the very high volume of transactions we process it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical systems our systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes and errors or misfeasance by our employees if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations any material interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are currently making and will continue to make investments to improve or advance critical information systems and processing capabilities failure to monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace could be harmful the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process should mitigate this risk excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more 

difficult for us to realize benefits targeting the wrong opportunities failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost 

we previously identified a material weakness in our internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls and if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control in the future this could result in loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price 

internal controls related to the operation of technology systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting we reported in our annual report on form 10k as of september 2 2018 a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls itgcs in the areas of user access and program changemanagement over certain information technology systems that support the company’s financial reporting processes during 2019 we completed the remediation measures related to the material weakness and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 1 2019  completion of remediation does not provide assurance that our remediation or other controls will continue to operate properly if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures our ability to record process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information we could damage our reputation with members and employees incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

we receive retain and transmit personal information about our members and employees and entrust that information to thirdparty business associates including cloud serviceproviders that perform activities for us our warehouse and online businesses depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems or defects within our hardware or software or those of our business associates that results in our members or employees information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation government actions or the imposition of penalties in addition a breach could require expending significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could disrupt our operations 

the use of data by our business and our business associates is highly regulated in all of our operating countries   privacy and informationsecurity laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to among other things systems changes and the development of new processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with laws and regulations such as the general data protection regulation gdpr and california consumer privacy act ccpa our reputation could be damaged possibly resulting in lost business and we could be subjected to additional legal risk or financial losses as a result of noncompliance 

we have security measures and controls to protect personal and business information and continue to make investments to secure access to our information technology network these measures may be undermined however due to the actions of outside parties employee error internal or external malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques timely discover or counter them or implement adequate 

preventative measures any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and potentially have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash and checks select credit and debit cards and our shop card as we offer new payment options to our members we may be subject to additional rules regulations compliance requirements and higher fraud losses for certain payment methods we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees along with additional transaction processing fees we rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers for example we are subject to payment card industry data security standards “pci dss” which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of individual cardholder data if our internal systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card reissuance costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members harm to our reputation and expose us to litigation 

if our merchandise such as food and prepared food products for human consumption drugs children  s products pet products and durable goods do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members   expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales increased costs litigation or reputational harm the sale of these items involves the risk of healthrelated illness or injury to our members such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects substances chemicals other agents or residues introduced during the growing manufacturing storage handling and transportation phases or faulty design our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with safety and other standards while we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause illness or injury or that we will not be subject to claims lawsuits or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be long term 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors our members are increasingly using mobile phones tablets computers and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media we are making investments in our websites and mobile applications if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant memberfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

inability to attract train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations merchandising and administrative personnel failure to identify and implement a succession plan for key senior management could negatively impact our business we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors including regulatory changes prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur property casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance 

the company is predominantly selfinsured for employee health care benefits workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors’ and officers’ liability vehicle liability and inventory loss insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit exposures arising from very large losses the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements significant claims or events regulatory changes a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses we still bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any warehouses depots manufacturing or home office facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by any such events to the extent they are below catastrophic levels of coverage as well as any losses to the extent they exceed our aggregate limits of applicable coverages such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations 

market and other external risks 

we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for members employees sites products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local regional and national wholesalers and retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries including other warehouseclub operators supermarkets supercenters internet retailers gasoline stations hard discounters department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways including pricing selection and availability services location convenience store hours and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications the evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop which has enhanced competition some competitors may have greater financial resources and technology capabilities better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

higher energy and gasoline costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs consumer debt levels foreigncurrency exchange rates unsettled financial markets weaknesses in housing and real estate markets reduced consumer confidence changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal and tax policies including changes in tax rates duties tariffs or other restrictions sovereign debt crises and other 

economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services require a change in product mix or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory additionally actions in various countries particularly china and the united states have created uncertainty with respect to tariff impacts on the costs of some of our merchandise the degree of our exposure is dependent on among other things the type of goods rates imposed and timing of the tariffs the impact to our business including net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors while these potential impacts are uncertain they could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

prices of certain commodities including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations taxes and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins these factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results general economic conditions can also be affected by events like the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism 

suppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards resulting in adverse effects on our business merchandise inventories sales and profit margins 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices as the quantities we require continue to grow we have no assurances of continued supply appropriate pricing or access to new products and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us member demands may lead to outofstock positions leading to loss of sales and profits 

we buy from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new suppliers and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality or more expensive because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited particularly for certain food items the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available 

our suppliers and those they depend upon for materials and services are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity inclement weather natural disasters supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control legal regulatory labor environmental or animal welfare standards these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members this failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands increase costs and otherwise adversely impact our business 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

during 2019  our international operations including canada generated 27  and 35  of our net sales and operating income respectively our international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses and we plan to continue international growth to prepare our consolidated financial statements we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars using current exchange rates future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our canadian and other international operations and have a corresponding adverse periodoverperiod effect on our results of operations as we continue to expand internationally our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase 

a portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold currency fluctuations may increase our cost of goods and may not be passed on to members consequently fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

natural disasters or other catastrophes could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes typhoons or earthquakes particularly in california or washington state where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located could negatively affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to our properties the temporary closure of warehouses depots manufacturing or home office facilities the temporary lack of an adequate work force the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses public health issues whether occurring in the us or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or members or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels these events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations us and foreign government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs and other regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability climate change and extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience we also sell a substantial amount of gasoline the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which could face increased regulation 

failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our warehouse and ecommerce comparable sales growth rates membership renewal rates new member signups gross margin earnings earnings per share new warehouse openings or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

legal and regulatory risks 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

at the end of 2019  we operated 239  warehouses outside of the us and we plan to continue expanding our international operations future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many similar to those we face in the us certain of which are beyond our control these factors include political and economic conditions regulatory constraints currency regulations policy changes such as the uks vote to withdraw from the european union commonly known as brexit and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade including tariffs and trade sanctions monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the us and foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the us risks inherent in international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of 

managing international operations adverse tax consequences and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 

accounting principles and related pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including selfinsurance liabilities and income taxes are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

we could be subject to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions additionally at any point in time we may be under examination for value added salesbased payroll product import or other nonincome taxes we may recognize additional tax expense be subject to additional tax liabilities or incur losses and penalties due to changes in laws regulations administrative practices principles assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax including tax rules in various jurisdictions we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate as tax rates vary among countries a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision additionally changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits including transfer pricing disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

significant changes in or failure to comply with regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters failure to comply with these laws could result in harm to our members employees or others significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance remediation or compensatory requirements or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards fines penalties and remediation costs we are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits including grand jury investigations government and agency investigations and consumer employment tort unclaimed property laws and other litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these proceedings and other contingencies including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities the outcome of some of these proceedings audits unclaimed property laws and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management  s attention and resources

 item 7—managements discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data 

overview 

we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth particularly comparable sales growth we define comparable sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year including remodels relocations and expansions and sales related to ecommerce websites operating for more than one year comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit average ticket sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions and changes from the revenue recognition standard the higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business including the effects of inflation or deflation especially the united states sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread across a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including those with ecommerce operations while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our privatelabel items and through online offerings 

our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices we do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods – consistently providing the most competitive values our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales gross margin percentage we believe that our gasoline business draws members but it generally has a significantly lower gross margin percentage relative to our nongasoline business a higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our nearterm net sales growth generally rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which given the higher sales base negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our selling general and administrative sga expenses as a percentage of net sales a decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect additionally actions in various countries particularly china and the united states have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise the degree of our exposure is dependent on among other things the type of goods rates imposed and timing of the tariffs the impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases while these potential impacts are uncertain they could have an adverse impact on our results 

we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses as our warehouse base grows available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth the negative aspects of such growth however including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to continue our ecommerce business growth domestically and internationally has also increased our sales 

the membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of our executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets 

our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area some significant costs are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility expenses with respect to the compensation of our employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits rather we believe that achieving our longerterm objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business is operated on very low margins modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income particularly merchandise costs and selling general and administrative expenses can have substantial impacts on net income 

our operating model is generally the same across our us canada and other international operating segments see note 11  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report certain countries in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth lower wages and benefits costs as a percentage of country sales andor less or no direct membership warehouse competition 

in discussions of our consolidated operating results we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which are references to the differences between the foreignexchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars for financial reporting purposes this impact of foreignexchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current periods currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current periods average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period 

our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to august 31 references to 2019  and 2018  relate to the 52week fiscal years ended september 1 2019  and september 2 2018  respectively references to 2017  relate to the 53week fiscal year ended september 3 2017  certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding unless otherwise noted references to net income relate to net income attributable to costco 

highlights for 2019  included 



 

results of operations 

net sales 



 

 net sales 

net sales increased 10917  or 8  during 2019  primarily due to a 6  increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2018 and 2019 

changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately 1463 or 106 basis points compared to 2018 attributable to our canadian and other international operations the revenue recognition standard positively impacted net sales by 1332 or 96 basis points changes in gasoline prices did not have a material impact on net sales 

comparable sales 

comparable sales increased 6  during 2019  and were positively impacted by increases in both shopping frequency and average ticket comparable sales were negatively impacted by cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations 

membership fees 



the increase in membership fees was primarily due to membership signups at existing and new warehouses and the annual fee increase changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted membership fees by approximately 30 in 2019 at the end of 2019  our member renewal rates were 91  in the us and canada and 88  worldwide 

as reported in 2017 we increased our annual membership fees in the us and canada and in certain of our other international operations we account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis recognized ratably over the oneyear membership period these fee increases had a positive impact of approximately 178 in 2018 and positively impacted 2019 primarily the first two quarters by approximately 73 

gross margin 



the gross margin of our core merchandise categories food and sundries hardlines softlines and fresh foods when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales rather than total net sales increased seven basis points primarily due to increases in food and sundries and fresh foods partially offset by decreases in softlines and hardlines this measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses 

total gross margin percentage decreased two basis points compared to 2018 excluding the impact of the revenue recognition standard on net sales gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 1112 an increase of eight basis points this increase was primarily due to a 19 basis point increase in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses predominantly our gasoline business this increase was partially offset by decreases of four basis points in our core merchandise categories four basis points due to an adjustment to our estimate of breakage on rewards earned under our cobranded credit card program and three basis points due to increased spending by members under the executive membership 2 reward program changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 155 in 2019 

the segment gross margin percentage when expressed as a percentage of the segments own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales segment gross margin percentage increased in our us operations predominantly in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses primarily our gasoline business this increase was partially offset by decreases in our core merchandise categories and the breakage adjustment noted above the segment gross margin percentage in our canadian operations decreased predominantly in hardlines and softlines and certain of our warehouse ancillary and other businesses partially offset by an increase in fresh foods the segment gross margin percentage in our other international operations decreased primarily in our core merchandise categories and due to the introduction of the executive membership 2 reward program in korea this decrease was partially offset by an increase in our gasoline business 

selling general and administrative expenses 



sga expenses as a percentage of net sales increased two  basis points compared to 2018  excluding the impact of the revenue recognition standard on net sales sga expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales were 1013 an increase of 11 basis points this increase is largely due to a 123 charge or eight basis points recorded in the us related to a product tax assessment central operating costs were higher by two basis points and stock compensation expense was higher by one basis point operating costs as a percent of adjusted net sales related to warehouses ancillary and other businesses which includes ecommerce and travel were flat despite the wage increases and bonding leave benefits for us and canadian hourly employees effective in march 2019 changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar positively impacted sga expenses by approximately 124 in 2019 

preopening 



preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses and relocations developments in new international markets new manufacturing and distribution facilities and expansions at existing warehouses preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse and facility openings the timing of the opening relative to our yearend whether a warehouse is owned or leased and whether openings are in an existing new or international market in 2019 we opened our first warehouse in china subsequent to year end operations commenced at our new poultry processing plant 

interest expense 



interest expense primarily relates to senior notes issued by the company interest expense decreased in 2019 largely due to an increase in capitalized interest associated with our new poultry processing plant 

interest income and other net 



the increase in interest income in 2019  was primarily due to higher interest rates earned on higher average cash and investment balances foreigncurrency transaction gains losses net include the revaluation and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities and marktomarket adjustments for forward foreignexchange contracts by our canadian and other international operations see derivatives and foreign currency sections in item 8 note 1  of this report 

provision for income taxes 



our effective tax rate for 2019 was favorably impacted by the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate in december 2017 from 35 to 21 which was in effect for all of 2019 and compared to a higher blended rate effective for 2018 net discrete tax benefits of 221 in 2019 included a benefit of 59 related to the stockbased compensation accounting standard adopted in the first quarter of 2018 this also included a tax benefit of 105 related to us taxation of deemed foreign dividends offset by losses of foreign tax credits which impacted the effective tax rate the tax rate for 2019 was 269 excluding the net discrete tax benefits 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents 



our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 9444  and 7259  at the end of 2019  and 2018  respectively of these balances unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately 1434  and 1348  at the end of 2019 and 2018 respectively these receivables generally settle within four days cash and cash equivalents were negatively impacted by a change in exchange rates of 15  and 37  in 2019  and 2018  respectively and positively impacted by 25 in 2017 

management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future we believe that our us current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our us liquidity requirements we no longer consider earnings after 2017 of our nonus consolidated subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 6356  in 2019  compared to 5774  in 2018  our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise suppliers warehouse operating costs including payroll and employee benefits utilities and credit and debit card processing fees cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable is impacted by several factors including how fast inventory is sold payment terms with our suppliers and the amount of payables paid early to obtain discounts from our suppliers 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 2865  in 2019  compared to 2947  in 2018  and primarily related to capital expenditures net cash flows from investing activities also includes maturities and purchases of shortterm investments 

capital expenditures 

our primary requirement for capital is acquiring land buildings and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses capital is also required for information systems manufacturing and distribution facilities initial warehouse operations and working capital in   2019  we spent   2998   on capital expenditures and it is our current intention to spend approximat ely 3000 to 3200 d uring fiscal 2020   these expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments   we opened   25   new warehous es including five  relocations in 2019  and plan to open approximately 22 additional new warehouses including three relocations in 2020 there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 1147  in 2019  compared to 1281  in 2018  cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to the payment of dividends withholding taxes on stockbased awards and repurchases of common stock dividends totaling  1038  were paid during 2019 of which 250 related to the dividend declared in august 2018 in august 2019 approximately 200 and 100 of guaranteed senior notes were issued by our japanese subsidiary at fixed interest rates of 028 and 042 respectively 

stock repurchase programs 

in april 2019 the board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of 4000 which expires in april 2023 this authorization revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling 2237  during 2019  and 2018  we repurchased 1097000  and 1756000  shares of common stock at average prices of 22516  and 18313  respectively totaling approximately 247  and 322  respectively the remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was 3943  at the end of 2019  these amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year purchases are made from timetotime as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under sec rule 10b51 repurchased shares are retired in accordance with the washington business corporation act 

dividends 

cash dividends declared in 2019  totaled 244  per share as compared to 214  per share in 2018  in april 2019  the board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from 057  to 065  per share in august 2019  the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of 065  per share which was paid subsequent to the end of 2019 

bank credit facilities and commercial paper programs 

we maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes at september 1 2019  we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of 865 including a 400 revolving line of credit which expires in june 2020 the company currently has no plans to draw upon this facility our international operations maintain 355 of the total borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities of which 150 is guaranteed by the company there were no outstanding shortterm borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2019  and 2018  

the company has letter of credit facilities for commercial and standby letters of credit totaling 219 the outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2019  totaled 145 most of which were standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year the bank credit facilities have various expiration dates most of which are within one year and we generally intend to renew these facilities the amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding 

contractual obligations 

at september 1 2019  our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows   



 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the opinion of management we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements other than operating leases included in the table above and discussed in note 1  and note 5  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates for further information on significant accounting policies see discussion in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

insuranceselfinsurance liabilities 

the company is predominantly selfinsured for employee healthcare benefits workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors’ and officers’ liability vehicle liability and inventory loss insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to seek to limit exposures arising from very large losses we use different risk management mechanisms including a whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary and participate in a reinsurance program liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated by using historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates regulatory or legal changes and unforeseen developments in claims over time while we believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment also is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these positions and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate the 2017 tax act includes various provisions that significantly altered us tax law many of which impact our business see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in millions 

our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents as defined in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report as well as shortterm investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields the majority of our shortterm investments are in fixed interestrate securities these securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations 

our policy limits investments in the us to direct us government and government agency obligations repurchase agreements collateralized by us government and government agency obligations us government and government agency money market funds and insured bank balances our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary invests in us government and government agency obligations and us government and government agency money market funds our canadian and other international subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds bankers’ acceptances and bank certificates of deposit generally denominated in local currencies 

a 100 basispoint change in interest rates as of the end of 2019  would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value for those investments that are classified as availableforsale the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets 

the nature and amount of our longterm debt may vary as a result of business requirements market conditions and other factors as of the end of 2019  longterm debt with fixed interest rates was 6852  fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixedrate debt see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for more information on our longterm debt 

foreign currency risk 

our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in nonfunctional currencies which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates we manage these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreignexchange contracts seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a nonfunctional foreigncurrency the contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the us dollar we seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions for additional information related to the companys forward foreignexchange contracts see notes 1  and 3  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the functional currency compared to the nonfunctional currency exchange rates at september 1 2019  would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by 79 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy particularly electricity and natural gas and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing operations which we seek to partially mitigate through fixedprice contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities predominantly in the us and canada we also enter into variablepriced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis these contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no marktomarket adjustment

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e or 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive and financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure the chief executive officer ceo and the chief financial officer cfo with assistance from other members of management have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of september 1 2019  and based on their evaluation have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date 

managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us gaap and includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

under the supervision of and with the participation of our management we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 1 2019  using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework 2013 

as disclosed in part ii item 9a controls and procedures in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 2 2018  during the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2018  we identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls itgcs in the areas of user access and program changemanagement over certain information technology it systems that support the company’s financial reporting processes 

during 2019  management implemented our previously disclosed remediation plan that included i creating and filling an it compliance oversight function ii developing a training program addressing itgcs and policies including educating control owners concerning the principles and requirements of each control with a focus on those related to user access and changemanagement over it systems impacting financial reporting iii developing and maintaining documentation underlying itgcs to promote knowledge transfer upon personnel and function changes iv developing enhanced risk assessment procedures and controls related to changes in it systems v implementing an it management review and testing plan to monitor 

itgcs with a specific focus on systems supporting our financial reporting processes and vi enhanced quarterly reporting on the remediation measures to the audit committee of the board of directors 

during the fourth  quarter of 2019  we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented controls and found them to be effective as a result we have concluded the material weakness has been remediated as of september 1 2019  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

except for the changes in connection with our implementation of the remediation plan discussed above there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f or 15d15f of the exchange act that occurred during the fourth  quarter of 2019  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

general 

we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and privatelabel products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins net sales less merchandise costs than most other retailers we generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it even while taking advantage of early payment discounts 

we buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to crossdocking consolidation points depots or directly to our warehouses our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses this process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies lowering costs associated with traditional multiplestep distribution channels 

our average warehouse space is approximately 145000 square feet with newer units being slightly larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and 

low prices our warehouses are not elaborate by strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format we believe our inventory losses shrinkage are well below those of typical retail operations 

our warehouses on average operate on a sevenday 70hour week gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities reducing labor required in general with variations by country our warehouses accept certain credit including the costco cobranded card and debit cards cash and checks 

our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of highquality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere we seek to limit items to fastselling models sizes and colors we carry an average of approximately 3700 active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business significantly less than other broadline retailers many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise on certain electronic items we typically have a 90day return policy and provide free of charge technical support services as well as an extended warranty additional thirdparty warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items 

we offer merchandise in the following categories 

 ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services encouraging members to shop more frequently these businesses include gas stations pharmacies optical dispensing centers food courts and hearingaid centers the number of warehouses with gas stations vary significantly by country and we do not operate our gasoline business in korea or france we operated 567 gas stations at the end of 2018  

our ecommerce operations allow us to connect with our members online and provide additional products and services many not found in our warehouses we operate ecommerce websites in the us canada mexico uk korea and taiwan net sales for ecommerce represented approximately 4 of total net sales in 2018  additionally we offer business delivery travel and various other services online in certain countries 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brandname merchandise we do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier we generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if current sources of supply became unavailable we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business we also purchase and manufacture privatelabel merchandise as long as quality and member demand are comparable and the value to our members is significant 

certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

membership 

our members may utilize their memberships at our warehouses worldwide gold star memberships are available to individuals business memberships are limited to businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or comparable evidence business members have the ability to add additional cardholders affiliates to which the same annual fee applies affiliates are not available for gold star members our annual fee for these memberships is 60 in our us and canadian operations and varies in other countries all paid memberships include a free household card 

our member renewal rate was 90 in the us and canada and 88 on a worldwide basis at the end of 2018  the majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date therefore our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date 

our membership was made up of the following in thousands 



paid cardholders except business affiliates are eligible to upgrade to an executive membership in the us and canada for an additional annual fee of 60 executive memberships are also available in mexico and the uk for which the additional annual fee varies executive members earn a 2 reward on qualified purchases up to a maximum reward of 1000 per year in us and canada and varies in mexico and the uk and can be redeemed only at costco warehouses this program also offers except in mexico access to additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services such as auto and home insurance the costco auto purchase program and check printing services these services are generally provided by third parties and vary by state and country executive members who represented 37  of paid members at the end of 2018  generally shop more frequently and spend more than other members 

labor 

our employee count was as follows 



approximately 15900  employees are union employees we consider our employee relations to be very good 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection location convenience distribution strategy and customer service we compete on a worldwide basis with global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenters internet retailers gasoline stations hard discounters department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise walmart target kroger and amazoncom are among our significant general 

merchandise retail competitors we also compete with warehouse club operations primarily walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club and nearly every major us and mexico metropolitan area has multiple club operations 

intellectual property 

we believe that to varying degrees our trademarks trade names copyrights proprietary processes trade secrets patents trade dress domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success we have invested significantly in the development and protection of our wellrecognized brands including the costco wholesale ®  trademarks and our privatelabel brand kirkland signature ®  we believe that kirkland signature products are high quality offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than national brands and that they help lower costs differentiate our merchandise offerings and generally earn higher margins we expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private label items 

we rely on trademark and copyright laws tradesecret protection and confidentiality license and other agreements with our suppliers employees and others to protect our intellectual property the availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are properly maintained

 item 1a—risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial these risk factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with management  s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item   7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item   8 of this report 

business and operating risks 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our us and canadian operations 

our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our us and canadian operations which comprised 87 and 83 of net sales and operating income in 2018  respectively within the us we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 30 of us net sales in 2018  our california market in general has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our us operations particularly in california and our canadian operations could arise from among other things slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales comparable sales negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor healthcare and energy costs failing to meet targets for warehouse openings cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products 

we may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth is dependent in part on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing leasing and operating warehouses and depots we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms in addition certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability 

we seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance member traffic and profitability 

we intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us attracting members of other wholesale club operators our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence we cannot ensure that new warehouses and new websites will be profitable and as a result future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

our failure to maintain membership growth loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations 

membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of our executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable sales diminish member trust and reduce member renewal rates and accordingly net sales and membership fee revenue negatively impacting our results of operations 

we sell many products under our kirkland signature brand maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty these products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products carried in our warehouses and represent a growing portion of our overall sales if the kirkland signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected 

disruptions in our merchandise distribution or processing packaging manufacturing and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction 

we depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process primarily through our depots we also rely upon processing packaging manufacturing and other facilities to support our business which includes the production of certain privatelabel items although we believe that our operations are efficient disruptions due to fires tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes or other catastrophic events labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire our success depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly we may have excess inventory which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance this could have an adverse effect on net sales gross margin and operating income 

we rely extensively on information technology to process transactions compile results and manage our businesses failure or disruption of our primary and backup systems could adversely affect our businesses a failure to adequately update our existing systems and implement new systems could harm our businesses and adversely affect our results of operations 

given the very high volume of transactions we process each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes and errors by our employees if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are currently making and will continue to make investments to improve or advance critical information systems and processing capabilities failure to monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace would be harmful the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more difficult 

for us to realize benefits targeting the wrong opportunities failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost 

we identified a material weakness in our internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls which if not remediated appropriately or timely could result in loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price 

internal controls related to the operation of technology systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as disclosed in part ii item 9a during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 management identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls itgcs in the areas of user access and program changemanagement over certain information technology it systems that support the company’s financial reporting processes as a result management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of september 2 2018 we are implementing remedial measures and while there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful we plan to remediate the material weakness prior to the end of fiscal 2019 these measures will result in additional technology and other expenses if we are unable to remediate the material weakness or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures our ability to record process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information we could damage our reputation with members and employees incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

we receive retain and transmit personal information about our members and employees and entrust that information to thirdparty business associates including cloud serviceproviders that perform activities for us our warehouse and online businesses depend upon the secure transmission of encrypted confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems or defects within our hardware or software or those of our business associates that results in our members or employees information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation government actions or the imposition of penalties in addition a breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could disrupt our operations 

the use of data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the national and state or local level in all of our operating countries   privacy and informationsecurity laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to among other things systems changes and the development of new processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations our reputation could be damaged possibly resulting in lost future business and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of noncompliance including fines of up to 4 of our global revenue in the case of the general data protection regulation gdpr we do not maintain cyberinsurance for these risks 

we have security measures and controls to protect personal and business information and continue to make investments to secure access to our information technology network these measures may be undermined however due to the actions of outside parties employee error internal or external malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade 

service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques timely discover or counter them or implement adequate preventative measures any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and potentially have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash and checks a select variety of credit and debit cards and our proprietary cash card as we offer new payment options to our members we may be subject to additional rules regulations compliance requirements and higher fraud losses for certain payment methods we pay interchange and other related card acceptance fees along with additional transaction processing fees we rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services including the processing of credit and debit cards and our proprietary cash card and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to payment card association and network operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change over time for example we are subject to payment card industry data security standards “pci dss” which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of individual cardholder data in addition if our internal systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card reissuance costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit andor debit card payments from our members and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members harm to our reputation and expose us to litigation 

if our merchandise such as food and prepared food products for human consumption drugs children  s products pet products and durable goods do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members   expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales increased costs litigation or reputational harm the sale of these items involves the risk of healthrelated illness or injury to our members such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects substances chemicals other agents or residues introduced during the growing manufacturing storage handling and transportation phases or faulty design our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards while we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause illness or injury in the future or that we will not be subject to claims lawsuits or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be long term 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors our members are increasingly using mobile phones tablets computers and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media we are making technology investments in our websites and mobile applications if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant memberfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

inability to attract train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations merchandising and administrative personnel failure to identify and implement a succession plan for key senior management could negatively impact the business 

we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors including regulatory changes prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur property casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance 

the company is predominantly selfinsured for employee health care benefits workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors’ and officers’ liability vehicle liability and inventory loss insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit the exposure arising from catastrophic events the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements significant claims or events regulatory changes a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are primarily selfinsured as it relates to property damage although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic losses we still bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any warehouses depots manufacturing or home office facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by any such events to the extent they are below catastrophic levels of coverage as well as any losses to the extent they exceed our aggregate limits of applicable coverages such losses could materially impact our cash flow and results of operations 

market and other external risks 

we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for members employees sites products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local regional and national wholesalers and retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries including other warehouseclub operators supermarkets supercenters internet retailers gasoline stations hard discounters department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise pricing selection and availability services location convenience store hours and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications the evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop with digital devices which has enhanced competition some competitors may have greater financial resources and technology capabilities better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

higher energy and gasoline costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs consumer debt levels foreigncurrency exchange rates unsettled financial markets weaknesses in housing and real estate markets reduced consumer confidence changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal and tax 

policies including changes in tax rates duties tariffs or other restrictions sovereign debt crises and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services require a change in product mix or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory prices of certain commodity products including gasoline and other food products are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations taxes and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins these factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results general economic conditions can also be affected by significant events like the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism 

vendors may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards resulting in adverse effects on our business merchandise inventories sales and profit margins 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices as the quantities we require continue to grow we have no assurances of continued supply appropriate pricing or access to new products and any vendor has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us member demands may lead to outofstock positions of our merchandise leading to loss of sales and profits 

we buy from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited particularly for certain food items the large volume we demand may not be consistently available 

our suppliers and those they depend upon for materials and services are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity inclement weather natural disasters supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise for these or other reasons one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control legal regulatory labor environmental or animal welfare standards these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members this failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands increase our costs and otherwise adversely impact our business 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

during 2018  our international operations including canada generated 28 and 38 of our net sales and operating income respectively our international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses and we plan to continue international growth to prepare our consolidated financial statements we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars using current exchange rates future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our canadian and other international operations and have a corresponding adverse periodoverperiod effect on our results of operations as we continue to expand internationally our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase 

a portion of the products we purchase for sale in our warehouses around the world is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold currency fluctuations may increase our cost of goods and may not be passed on to members consequently fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

natural disasters or other catastrophes could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes typhoons or earthquakes particularly in california or washington state where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located could negatively affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the temporary closure of one or more warehouses depots manufacturing or home office facilities the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots within the countries in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses public health issues whether occurring in the us or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or members or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels these events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations us and foreign government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance and merchandise costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs that could materially affect our profitability climate change and extreme weather conditions such as intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience we also sell a substantial amount of gasoline the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which could face increased regulation 

failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our warehouse and ecommerce comparable sales growth rates membership renewal rates new member signups gross margin earnings earnings per share new warehouse openings or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

legal and regulatory risks 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

during 2018  we operated 235 warehouses outside of the us and we plan to continue expanding our international operations future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many similar to those we face in the us certain of which are beyond our control these factors include political and economic conditions regulatory constraints currency regulations policy changes such as the uks vote to withdraw from the european union commonly known as brexit and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade including tariffs monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the us and foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the us risks inherent in international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 

accounting principles and related pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including selfinsurance liabilities and income taxes are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate as tax rates vary among countries a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision additionally changes in the enacted tax rates adverse outcomes in tax audits including transfer pricing disputes or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

significant changes in or failure to comply with federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters failure to comply with these laws could result in harm to our members employees or others significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance remediation or compensatory requirements or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards fines penalties and remediation costs we are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits including grand jury investigations government and agency investigations and consumer employment tort unclaimed property laws and other litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these proceedings and other contingencies including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities the outcome of some of these proceedings audits unclaimed property laws and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management  s attention and resources

 item 7—managements discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data 

overview 

we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth particularly comparable warehouse sales comparable sales growth we define comparable sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year including remodels relocations and expansions as well as online sales related to ecommerce websites operating for more than one year comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit average ticket sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions the higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business including the effects of inflation or deflation especially the united states sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread across a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including those with ecommerce operations while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our private label items and through our online offerings 

our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices we do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods – consistently providing the most competitive values our investments in merchandise pricing can from time to time include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members all negatively impacting nearterm gross margin as a percentage of net sales gross margin percentage we believe that our gasoline business draws members but it generally has a significantly lower gross margin percentage relative to our nongasoline business a higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our nearterm net sales growth generally rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which given the higher sales base negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our selling general and administrative sga expenses as a percentage of net sales a decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect 

we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses as our warehouse base grows available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth the negative aspects of such growth however including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to continue our ecommerce business growth domestically and internationally has also increased our sales 

our membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of our executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets 

our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area some significant costs are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility expenses with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits rather we believe that achieving our longerterm objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business is operated on very low margins modest changes in various items in the income statement particularly merchandise costs and selling general and administrative expenses can have substantial impacts on net income 

our operating model is generally the same across our us canada and other international operating segments see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report certain countries in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth lower wages and benefits costs as a percentage of country sales andor less or no direct membership warehouse competition 

in discussions of our consolidated operating results we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which are references to the differences between the foreignexchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars for financial reporting purposes this impact of foreignexchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current periods currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current periods average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period 

our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to august 31 fiscal year 2018  and 2016  were 52week fiscal years ending on september 2 2018  and august 28 2016  respectively and 2017  was a 53week fiscal year ending on september 3 2017  certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding unless otherwise noted references to net income relate to net income attributable to costco 

highlights for fiscal year 2018  included 



results of operations 

net sales 



2018  vs 2017   

net sales 

net sales increased 12262  or 10  during 2018  primarily due to a 9  increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2017  and 2018  partially offset by the impact of one additional week of sales in 2017 

changes in gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by approximately 2267 or 180 basis points due to a 19 increase in the average sales price per gallon changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately 1156 or 92 basis points compared to 2017  the positive impact was driven by both our canadian and other international operations 

comparable sales 

comparable sales increased 9  during 2018  and were positively impacted by increases in both shopping frequency and the average ticket the average ticket and comparable sales results were positively impacted by an increase in gasoline prices and exchange rates in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar changes in comparable sales includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations 

2017  vs 2016 

net sales 

net sales increased 10099 or 9 during 2017 primarily due to a 4 increase in comparable sales new warehouses opened in 2016 and 2017 and the benefit of one additional week of sales in 2017 changes in gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by approximately 785 or 68 basis points due to an 8 increase in the average sales price per gallon changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted net sales by   approximately 295 or 25 basis points compared to 2016 the negative impact was driven by other international operations partially offset by positive impacts attributable to our canadian operations 

comparable sales 

comparable sales increased 4 during 2017 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency and to a lesser extent an increased average ticket the average ticket and comparable sales results were positively impacted by an increase in gasoline prices offset by decreases in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar changes in comparable sales includes the negative impact of cannibalization 

membership fees 



2018  vs 2017 

the increase in membership fees was primarily due to the annual fee increase and membership signups at existing and new warehouses these increases were partially offset by the impact of one additional week of membership fees in 2017 at the end of 2018  our member renewal rates were 90  in the us and canada and 88  worldwide 

as reported in fiscal 2017 we increased our annual membership fees in the us and canada and in certain of our other international operations we account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis recognized ratably over the oneyear membership period these fee increases had a positive impact of approximately 178 in fiscal 2018 and will positively impact fiscal 2019 primarily the first two quarters by approximately 70 

2017  vs 2016 

the increase in membership fees was primarily due to membership signups at existing and new warehouses an extra week of membership fee revenue the annual fee increase and an increased number of upgrades to our higherfee executive membership program fee increases had a positive impact on membership fee revenues during 2017 of approximately 23 

gross margin 



2018  vs 2017 

the gross margin of our core merchandise categories food and sundries hardlines softlines and fresh foods when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales rather than total net sales increased one basis point primarily due to increases in food and sundries and hardlines partially offset by decreases in fresh foods and softlines this measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses 

total gross margin percentage decreased 29 basis points compared to 2017 excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 1122 a decrease of 11 basis points this decrease was primarily due to a shift in sales penetration to certain lower margin warehouse ancillary and other businesses which contributed to a 13 basis point decrease in our core merchandise categories except hardlines which was flat gross margin percentage was also negatively impacted by 10 basis points due to a nonrecurring legal settlement benefiting 2017 and costs related to our centralized return centers in the us these decreases were partially offset by a 13 basis point increase in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses predominantly our gasoline business changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar positively impacted gross margin by approximately 124 in 2018 

the segment gross margin percentage when expressed as a percentage of the segments own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales segment gross margin percentage decreased in our us operations predominantly in our core merchandise categories and as a result of the nonrecurring legal settlement in 2017 and the costs related to our centralized return centers mentioned above the segment gross margin percentage in our canadian operations increased due to warehouse ancillary and other businesses primarily our gasoline business the segment gross margin percentage in our other international operations decreased predominantly in food and sundries and softlines partially offset by an increase in our gasoline business 

2017  vs 2016 

the gross margin of our core merchandise categories when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales increased eight basis points due to increases in these categories other than fresh foods 

total gross margin percentage decreased two basis points compared to 2016 excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 1140 an increase of five basis points this increase was primarily due to amounts earned under the cobranded credit card arrangement in the us of 15 basis points and a benefit of three basis points from nonrecurring legal settlements and other matters the improvement in terms in our current cobrand agreement as compared to the prior cobrand arrangement led to substantial year over year benefits in fiscal 2017 these increases were partially offset by a six basis point decrease in our core merchandise categories primarily due to food and sundries as a result of a decrease in sales penetration the gross margin percentage was also negatively impacted by five basis points due to a lifo benefit in 2016 and one basis point in warehouse ancillary and other businesses changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar had an immaterial impact on gross margin in 2017 

gross margin on a segment basis when expressed as a percentage of the segments own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales increased in our us operations due to amounts 

earned under the cobranded credit card arrangement and nonrecurring legal settlements and other matters as discussed above these increases were partially offset by a decrease in core merchandise categories predominantly food and sundries as a result of a decrease in sales penetration and a lifo benefit in 2016 the segment gross margin percentage in our canadian operations increased primarily due to increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses primarily our pharmacy business partially offset by a decrease in our core merchandise categories largely fresh foods the segment gross margin percentage increased in our other international operations due to increases across all core merchandise categories except fresh foods 

selling general and administrative expenses 



2018  vs 2017 

sga expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 24 basis points compared to 2017 excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales sga expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 1019 a decrease of seven basis points operating costs related to warehouses ancillary and other businesses which includes ecommerce and travel were lower by six basis points predominantly in our us and other international operations due to leveraging increased sales charges related to certain nonrecurring legal and other matters in 2017 positively impacted sga expense by two basis points stock compensation expense was also lower by one basis point central operating costs were higher by two basis points changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar increased our sga expenses by approximately 98 in 2018 

effective in june 2018 a portion of the savings generated from the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” were used to increase wages for the majority of our us hourly employees the impact in fiscal 2018 was two basis points and the estimated annualized pretax cost of these increases is approximately 120 

2017  vs 2016 

sga expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 14 basis points compared to 2016 excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales sga expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 1033 a decrease of seven basis points operating costs related to warehouses ancillary and other businesses were lower by nine basis points primarily due to lower costs associated with the cobranded credit card arrangement in the us of 18 basis points the improvement in terms in our current cobrand agreement as compared to the prior cobrand arrangement led to substantial year over year benefits in fiscal 2017 this was partially offset by higher payroll and employee benefit expenses of 11 basis points primarily in our us operations central operating costs were higher by one basis point primarily due to increased costs associated with our information systems modernization including increased depreciation for projects placed in service incurred by our us operations stock compensation expense was also higher by one basis point 

preopening 



preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses and relocations developments in new international markets new manufacturing and distribution facilities and expansions at existing warehouses preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings the timing of the opening relative to our yearend whether the warehouse is owned or leased and whether the opening is in an existing new or international market in 2017 we entered into two new international markets iceland and france 

interest expense 



interest expense primarily relates to senior notes issued by the company in may 2017 we issued 3800 in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in march and june 2017 we repaid 2200 in total outstanding principal of the 55 and 1125 senior notes respectively 

interest income and other net 



2018  vs 2017   

the increase in interest income in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher interest rates earned on higher average cash and investment balances foreigncurrency transaction gains losses net include the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities and marktomarket adjustments for forward foreignexchange contracts by our canadian and other international operations in 2018 the increase was primarily due to a strengthening us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies on forward foreignexchange contracts see derivatives and foreign currency sections in item 8 note 1 of this report 

2017  vs 2016   

foreigncurrency transaction gains losses net include the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities and marktomarket adjustments for forward foreignexchange contracts by our canadian and other international operations 

provision for income taxes 



our effective tax rate for 2018  was favorably impacted by the 2017 tax act which included a reduction in the us federal corporate rate from 35 to 21 due to the timing of our fiscal year relative to the effective date of the rate change our us corporate rate for 2018 resulted in a blended rate of 256 other impacts from the 2017 tax act consisted of tax expense of 142  for the estimated tax on deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings and 43  for the reduction in foreign tax credits and other immaterial items largely offset by a tax benefit of 166  for the provisional remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities in 2018 we also recognized net tax benefits of 76 which was largely driven by the adoption of an accounting standard related to stockbased compensation and other immaterial net benefits 

in 2017 our provision was favorably impacted by net tax benefits of 104 primarily due to a tax benefit recorded in connection with the may 2017 special dividend paid to employees through our 401k retirement plan of 82 this dividend was deductible for us income tax purposes 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents 



our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 7259  and 5779  at the end of 2018  and 2017  respectively of these balances approximately  1348  and  1255  represented unsettled credit and debit card receivables respectively these receivables generally settle within four days cash and cash equivalents were negatively impacted by a change in exchange rates of  37  in 2018  and positively impacted by  25  and  50  in 2017   and   2016  respectively 

management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future while we believe that our us current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our us liquidity requirements beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 we no longer consider current fiscal year and future earnings of our nonus consolidated subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested we recorded the estimated incremental foreign withholding net of available foreign tax credits and state income taxes payable on current fiscal year earnings assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the us we continue to consider undistributed earnings of certain nonus consolidated subsidiaries prior to fiscal 2018 to be indefinitely reinvested and have not provided for withholding or state taxes 

in fiscal 2018 we recorded a onetime charge of 142  for the estimated tax on deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings under the 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act provides for the payment of the federal tax over an eightyear period because of the availability of foreign tax credits the amount payable is 97 of which 89 is classified as longterm and included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled  5774  in 2018  compared to  6726  in 2017  our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees cash flow used in operations 

generally consists of payments to our merchandise vendors warehouse operating costs including payroll and employee benefits utilities and credit and debit card processing fees cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2018  when compared to 2017  was primarily due to accelerated vendor payments of approximately 1700 made in the last week of fiscal 2016 which positively impacted cash flows in 2017 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 2947  in 2018  compared to 2366  in 2017  and primarily related to capital expenditures net cash flows from investing activities also includes maturities and purchases of shortterm investments 

capital expenditures 

we opened   21   net new warehous es and relocated 4 warehouses in 2018  and plan to open approximately 20 net new warehouses and relocate up to 4 warehouses in 2019  our primary requirement for capital is acquiring land buildings and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses capital is also required for information systems manufacturing and distribution facilities initial warehouse operations and working capital in   2018  we spent   2969   on capital expenditures and it is our current intention to spend approximately 2800 to 3100 during fiscal   2019    these expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 1281  in 2018  compared to 3218  in 2017  the primary uses of cash in 2018  were related to dividend payments and repurchases of common stock net cash used in financing activities in 2017  primarily related to dividend payments predominantly the special dividend paid in may 2017 and the repayments of debt totaling 2200 representing the aggregate principal balances of the 55 and 1125 senior notes 

in may 2017 we issued 3800 in aggregate principal amount of senior notes the proceeds received were net of a discount and used to pay the special dividend and a portion of the redemption of the 1125 senior notes 

stock repurchase programs 

during 2018  and 2017  we repurchased 1756000  and 2998000  shares of common stock at average prices of 18313  and 15787  totaling approximately 322  and 473  respectively the remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was 2427  at the end of 2018  these amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year purchases are made from timetotime as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under sec rule 10b51 repurchased shares are retired in accordance with the washington business corporation act 

dividends 

cash dividends declared in 2018  totaled  214  per share as compared to  890  per share in 2017  which included a special cash dividend of 700 per share in april 2018  our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from 050  to 057  per share subsequent to the end of 2018 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of 057  per share which is payable on november 23 2018 

bank credit facilities and commercial paper programs 

we maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes at september 2 2018  we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of 857 including a 400 revolving line of credit renewed by the us which expires in june 2019 the company currently has no plans to draw upon this facility our international operations maintain 344 of the total borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities of which 163 is guaranteed by the company there were no outstanding shortterm borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2018 and 2017 

the company has letter of credit facilities for commercial and standby letters of credit totaling 220 the outstanding standby letters of credit under these facilities at the end of 2018 totaled 149 and expire within one year the bank credit facilities and commercial paper programs have various expiration dates all within one year and we generally intend to renew these facilities the amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit then outstanding 

contractual obligations 

at september 2 2018  our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows   



 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the opinion of management we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements other than operating leases included in the table above and discussed in note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates for further information on significant accounting policies see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

insuranceselfinsurance liabilities 

the company is predominantly selfinsured for employee healthcare benefits workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors’ and officers’ liability vehicle liability and inventory loss insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit the exposure arising from catastrophic events we use different mechanisms including a whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary and participate in a reinsurance program liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated by using historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates regulatory or legal changes and unforeseen developments in claims of an extended nature while we believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment also is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these positions and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate in december 2017 the 2017 tax act was signed into law and our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 reflects the provisional impact see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements

our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents as defined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report as well as shortterm investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields the majority of our shortterm investments are in fixed interestrate securities these securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations 

our policy limits investments in the us to direct us government and government agency obligations repurchase agreements collateralized by us government and government agency obligations and us government and government agency money market funds our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary invests in us government and government agency obligations and us government and government agency money market funds our canadian and other international subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds bankers’ acceptances and bank certificates of deposit generally denominated in local currencies 

a 100 basispoint change in interest rates as of the end of 2018  would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value for those investments that are classified as availableforsale the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets 

the nature and amount of our longterm debt may vary as a result of business requirements market conditions and other factors as of the end of 2018  longterm debt with fixed interest rates was 6577  fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixedrate debt see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for more information on our longterm debt 

foreign currencyexchange risk 

our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in their nonfunctional currencies which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates we manage these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreignexchange contracts seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a nonfunctional foreigncurrency the contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the us dollar we seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions for additional information related to the companys forward foreignexchange contracts see notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the functional currency compared to the nonfunctional currency exchange rates at september 2 2018  would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by 80 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy particularly electricity and natural gas which we seek to partially mitigate through fixedprice contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities predominantly in the us and canada we also enter into variablepriced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis these contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no marktomarket adjustment

 item 9a—controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e or 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive and financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure the chief executive officer ceo and the chief financial officer cfo with assistance from other members of management have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of september 2 2018 and based on their evaluation have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below 

managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us gaap and includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

under the supervision of and with the participation of our management we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 2 2018 using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework 2013 a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

we identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls itgcs in the areas of user access and program changemanagement over certain information technology it systems that support the company’s financial reporting processes our business process controls automated and manual that are dependent on the affected itgcs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted we believe that these control deficiencies were a result of it control processes lacking sufficient documentation such that the successful operation of itgcs was overly dependent upon knowledge and actions of certain individuals with it expertise which led to failures resulting from changes in it personnel insufficient training of it personnel on the importance of itgcs and riskassessment processes inadequate to identify and assess changes in it environments that could impact internal control over financial reporting the material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements 

to the financial statements and there were no changes to previously released financial results based on this material weakness the company’s management concluded that at september 2 2018 the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective 

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of september 2 2018 which appears in item 8 of this form 10k 

following identification of the material weakness and prior to filing this annual report on form 10k we completed substantive procedures for the year ended september 2 2018 based on these procedures management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k have been prepared in accordance with us gaap our ceo and cfo have certified that based on their knowledge the financial statements and other financial information included in this form 10k fairly present in all material respects the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company as of and for the periods presented in this form 10k kpmg llp has issued an unqualified opinion on our financial statements which is included in item 8 of this form 10k 

remediation 

management has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated such that these controls are designed implemented and operating effectively the remediation actions include i creating and filling an it compliance oversight function ii developing a training program addressing itgcs and policies including educating control owners concerning the principles and requirements of each control with a focus on those related to user access and changemanagement over it systems impacting financial reporting iii developing and maintaining documentation underlying itgcs to promote knowledge transfer upon personnel and function changes iv developing enhanced risk assessment procedures and controls related to changes in it systems v implementing an it management review and testing plan to monitor itgcs with a specific focus on systems supporting our financial reporting processes and vi enhanced quarterly reporting on the remediation measures to the audit committee of the board of directors 

we believe that these actions will remediate the material weakness the weakness will not be considered remediated however until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that these controls are operating effectively we expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed prior to the end of fiscal 2019 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

except for the material weakness identified during the quarter as of september 2 2018 there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f or 15d15f of the exchange act that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

 item 1—business 

costco wholesale corporation and its subsidiaries costco or the company began operations in 1983 in seattle washington we are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the united states us and puerto rico canada united kingdom uk mexico japan australia spain france iceland and through majorityowned subsidiaries in taiwan and korea costco operated 741  715 and 686 warehouses worldwide at september 3 2017  august 28 2016  and august 30 2015  respectively our common stock trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “cost” 

we report on a 5253week fiscal year consisting of thirteen fourweek periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august the first three quarters consist of three periods each and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53week year the material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season references to 2017  relate to the 53week fiscal year ended september 3 2017  references to 2016  and 2015  relate to the 52week fiscal years ended august 28 2016  and august 30 2015  respectively 

general 

we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and privatelabel products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins net sales less merchandise costs than most other retailers we generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it even while taking advantage of early payment discounts when available 

we buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to crossdocking consolidation points depots or directly to our warehouses our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to individual warehouses this process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies eliminating many costs associated with traditional multiplestep distribution channels 

item 1—business continued 

our average warehouse space is approximately 145000 square feet with newer units slightly larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices our warehouses are not elaborate by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format we have inventory losses shrinkage well below those of typical retail operations 

our warehouses on average operate on a sevenday 70hour week gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities reducing labor required in general with variations by country our warehouses accept certain credit including the costco cobranded card and debit cards cash and checks 

our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of highquality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere we seek to limit items to fastselling models sizes and colors we carry an average of approximately 3800 active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business significantly less than other broadline retailers many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise on certain electronic items we typically have a 90day return policy and provide free of charge technical support services as well as an extended warranty additional thirdparty warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items 

we offer merchandise in the following categories 

 ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services encouraging members to shop more frequently these businesses include our gas stations pharmacy optical dispensing centers food courts and hearingaid centers we sell gasoline in all countries except korea and france with the number of warehouses with gas stations varying significantly by country we operated 536 508 and 472 gas stations at the end of 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

our online businesses which include ecommerce business delivery and travel vary by country in the us and canada we offer all of our online businesses we operate ecommerce websites in all countries except japan australia spain iceland and france online businesses provide our members additional products and services many not found in our warehouses net sales for our online business were approximately 4 of our total net sales in 2017   and   2016  respectively and 3 in 2015  

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brandname merchandise we do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier we generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business we also purchase privatelabel merchandise as long as quality and member demand are comparable and the value to our members is significant 

item 1—business continued 

certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

membership 

our members may utilize their memberships at any of our warehouses worldwide gold star memberships are available to individuals business memberships are limited to businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or comparable evidence business members have the ability to add additional cardholders addons addons are not available for gold star members effective june 1 2017 we increased our annual membership fees in the us and canada for gold star individual business and business addon by 5 to 60 per year the executive membership fee increased from 110 to 120 annual membership fee of 60 plus executive upgrade of 60 and the maximum annual 2 reward which is earned on qualified purchases and can be redeemed only at costco warehouses increased from 750 to 1000 our annual membership fees in our other international operations vary by country all paid memberships include a free household card 

our member renewal rate was 90  in the us and canada and 87  on a worldwide basis in 2017  the majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date therefore our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date 

our membership was made up of the following in thousands 



paid cardholders except business addons are eligible to upgrade to an executive membership in the us canada mexico and the uk for an additional annual fee which varies by country executive members have access to additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services except in mexico such as auto and home insurance the costco auto purchase program and check printing services the services are generally provided by thirdparties and vary by state and country executive members represented 38  of paid members at the end of 2017  executive members generally spend more than other members and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase 

labor 

our employee count was as follows 



approximately 15600  employees are union employees we consider our employee relations to be very good 

item 1—business continued 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection location convenience distribution strategy and customer service we compete on a worldwide basis with global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenters internet retailers gasoline stations hard discounters department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise walmart target kroger and amazoncom are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors we also compete with warehouse club operations primarily walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club and nearly every major us and mexico metropolitan area has multiple club operations 

intellectual property 

we believe that to varying degrees our trademarks trade names copyrights proprietary processes trade secrets patents trade dress domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success we have invested significantly in the development and protection of our wellrecognized brands including the costco wholesale ®  trademarks and our privatelabel brand kirkland signature ®  we believe that kirkland signature products are high quality products offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for similar national brand products and that they help lower costs differentiate our merchandise offerings from other retailers and generally earn higher margins we expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private label items 

we rely on trademark and copyright laws tradesecret protection and confidentiality license and other agreements with our suppliers employees and others to protect our intellectual property rights the availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained

 item 1a—risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial these risk factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with management  s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item   7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item   8 of this report 

business and operating risks 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our us and canadian operations 

our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our us and canadian operations which comprised 87 and 85 of net sales and operating income in 2017  respectively within the us we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 30 of us net sales in 2017  our california market in general has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our us operations particularly in california and our canadian operations could arise from among other things slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales comparable sales negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor healthcare and energy costs failing to meet targets for warehouse openings cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members 

we may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth is dependent in part on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and regional depots we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing leasing and operating our warehouses and depots we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms in addition certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us within their jurisdictions failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability 

we seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance and member traffic 

we intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us attracting members of other wholesale club operators our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence we cannot ensure that new warehouses and new websites will be profitably deployed and as a result future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

our failure to maintain membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations 

membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business model the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of our executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable sales diminish member trust and reduce member renewal rates and accordingly net sales and membership fee revenue negatively impacting our results of operations 

we sell many products under our kirkland signature brand maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty these products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products carried in our warehouses and represent a growing portion of our overall sales if the kirkland signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected 

disruptions in our merchandise distribution could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction 

we depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process primarily through our depots although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires tornadoes and hurricanes earthquakes or other catastrophic events labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members 

we rely extensively on information technology to process transactions compile results and manage our businesses failure or disruption of our primary and backup systems could adversely affect our businesses a failure to adequately update our existing systems and implement new systems could harm our businesses and adversely affect our results of operations 

given the very high volume of transactions we process each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes and errors by our employees if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to improve or replace critical information systems and processing capabilities failure to monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace would be harmful the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits targeting the wrong opportunities failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations additionally the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of memberrelated and other business information we could damage our reputation with members incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

we receive retain and transmit personal information about our members and entrust that information to thirdparty business associates including cloud service providers that perform activities for us our 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

warehouse and online businesses depend upon the secure transmission of encrypted confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems or those of our business associates that results in our members   information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could disrupt our operations 

the use of data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the national and state or local level in all of our operating countries   privacy and informationsecurity laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations our reputation could be damaged possibly resulting in lost future business and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of noncompliance 

our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties employee error internal or external malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques timely discover or counter them or implement adequate preventative measures any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash and checks a select variety of credit and debit cards and our proprietary cash card as we offer new payment options to our members we may be subject to additional rules regulations compliance requirements and higher fraud losses for certain payment methods we pay interchange and other related card acceptance fees along with additional transaction processing fees we rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services including the processing of credit and debit cards and our proprietary cash card and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to payment card association and network operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change over time for example we are subject to payment card industry data security standards “pci dss” which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of individual cardholder data in addition if our internal systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card reissuance costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit andor debit card payments from our members and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we might sell products that cause unexpected illness or injury to our members harm to our reputation and expose us to litigation 

if our merchandise offerings such as food and prepared food products for human consumption drugs children  s products pet products and durable goods do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members   expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales increased costs litigation or reputational harm the sale of these items involves the risk of healthrelated illness or injury to our members such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects substances chemicals other agents or residues introduced during the growing manufacturing storage handling and transportation phases or faulty design our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards while we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

with applicable laws and regulations we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness or injury in the future or that we will not be subject to claims lawsuits or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be long term 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire our success depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly we may have excess inventory which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance this could have an adverse effect on net sales gross margin and operating income 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our members our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors our members are increasingly using mobile phones tablets computers and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media we are making technology investments in our websites and mobile applications if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant memberfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

inability to attract train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations merchandising and administrative personnel failure to identify and implement a succession plan for key senior management could negatively impact the business 

we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors including regulatory changes prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur property casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance 

we are predominantly selfinsured with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks for employee health care benefits workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors’ and officers’ liability vehicle liability and inventory loss the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements the occurrence of significant claims a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

we are primarily selfinsured as it relates to property damage due to the substantial premiums required for insurance coverage over physical losses caused by certain natural disasters as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses although we maintain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses we still bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any warehouses depots manufacturing or home office facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by any such events to the extent they are below catastrophic levels of coverage as well as any losses to the extent they exceed our aggregate limits of applicable coverages such losses could materially impact our cash flow and results of operations 

market and other external risks 

we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for members employees sites products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local regional and national wholesalers and retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries including other warehouse club operators supermarkets supercenters internet retailers gasoline stations hard discounters and department and specialty stores such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise pricing selection and availability services location convenience store hours and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications the evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop with digital devices which has enhanced competition some competitors may have greater financial resources better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

higher energy and gasoline costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs consumer debt levels foreigncurrency exchange rates unsettled financial markets weaknesses in housing and real estate markets reduced consumer confidence changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal and tax policies including increased duties tariffs or other restrictions sovereign debt crises and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services require a change in product mix or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory prices of certain commodity products including gasoline and other food products are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations taxes and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins these factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results general economic conditions can also be affected by significant events like the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism 

vendors may be unable to supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices in a timely manner or may fail to adhere to our high standards resulting in adverse effects on our business merchandise inventories sales and profit margins 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices as the quantities we require continue to grow we have no assurances of continued supply appropriate pricing or access to new products and any vendor has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us member demands may lead to outofstock positions of our merchandise leading to loss of sales and profits 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

we buy from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited particularly for certain food items the large volume we demand may not be consistently available 

our suppliers and those they depend upon for materials and services are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity inclement weather natural disasters supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise for these or other reasons one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control legal regulatory labor environmental or animal welfare standards these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members this failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands increase our costs and otherwise adversely impact our business 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

during 2017  our international operations including canada generated 27 and 36 of our net sales and operating income respectively our international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses and we plan to continue international growth to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period future fluctuations in currency exchange rates over time that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our canadian and other international operations and have a corresponding adverse periodoverperiod effect on our results of operations as we continue to expand internationally our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase 

we may pay for products we purchase for sale in our warehouses around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold currency fluctuations may increase our cost of goods and may not be passed on to members consequently fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

natural disasters or other catastrophes could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes typhoons or earthquakes particularly in california or washington state where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located could negatively affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the temporary closure of one or more warehouses depots manufacturing or home office facilities the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots within the countries in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses public health issues whether occurring in the us or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or members or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels these events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations us and foreign government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs that could materially affect 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

our profitability climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience we also sell a substantial amount of gasoline the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which could face increased regulation climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels 

failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our warehouse and ecommerce comparable sales growth rates membership renewal rates new member signups gross margin earnings earnings per share new warehouse openings or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

legal and regulatory risks 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

during 2017  we operated 227 warehouses in 10 countries outside of the us and we plan to continue expanding our international operations future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many similar to those we face in the us certain of which are beyond our control these factors include political and economic conditions regulatory constraints currency regulations policy changes such as the uks vote to withdraw from the european union commonly known as brexit and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the us and foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the us risks inherent in international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 

accounting principles and related pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition merchandise inventories vendor rebates and other vendor consideration impairment of longlived assets selfinsurance liabilities and income taxes are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 

provisions for losses related to selfinsured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in health care cost inflation rates inherent in these claims can affect the amounts recognized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as changes in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate as tax rates vary among countries a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision additionally changes in the enacted tax rates adverse outcomes in tax audits including transfer pricing disputes or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

significant changes in or failure to comply with federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters failure to comply with these laws could result in harm to our members employees or others significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance remediation or compensatory requirements or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards fines penalties and remediation costs we are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits including grand jury investigations government and agency investigations and consumer employment tort unclaimed property laws and other litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these proceedings and other contingencies including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities the outcome of some of these proceedings audits unclaimed property laws and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management  s attention and resources

overview 

we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth particularly comparable sales growth we define comparable sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year including remodels relocations and expansions as well as online sales related to ecommerce websites operating for more than one year comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit average ticket sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions primarily impacting our us and canadian operations the higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business especially the united states sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread across a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our private label items 

our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at the most competitive prices we do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values our investments in merchandise pricing can from time to time include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members all negatively impacting nearterm gross margin as a percentage of net sales gross margin percentage we believe that our gasoline business draws members but it generally has a significantly lower gross margin percentage relative to our nongasoline business a higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our nearterm net sales growth generally rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which given the higher sales base negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our selling general and administrative sga expenses as a percentage of net sales a decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect we operate our lowermargin gasoline business in all countries except korea and france 

we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses as our warehouse base grows available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth the negative aspects of such growth however including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets are increasingly less significant relative to the results of our total operations our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to continue our ecommerce business growth both domestically and internationally has also increased our sales 

our membership format is an integral part of our business model and has a significant effect on our profitability this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase penetration of our executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability 

our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically some significant costs are partially outside our control most 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

particularly health care and utility expenses with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits rather we believe that achieving our longerterm objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business is operated on very low gross margins modest changes in various items in the income statement particularly merchandise costs and sga expenses can have substantial impacts on net income 

our operating model is generally the same across our us canada and other international operating segments see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report certain countries in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth lower wages and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales andor less or no direct membership warehouse competition 

in discussions of our consolidated operating results we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which are references to the differences between the foreignexchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars for financial reporting purposes this impact of foreignexchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current periods currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current periods average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period 

our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to august 31 fiscal year 2017  was a 53week fiscal year ending on september 3 2017  while 2016  and 2015  were 52week fiscal years ending on august 28 2016  and august 30 2015  respectively certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding unless otherwise noted references to net income relate to net income attributable to costco

results of operations 

net sales 



2017  vs 2016   

net sales 

net sales increased 10099  or 9  during 2017  primarily due to a 4 increase in comparable sales new warehouses opened in 2016  and 2017  and the benefit of one additional week of sales in 2017  changes in gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by approximately 785 or 68 basis points due to an 8 increase in the average sales price per gallon changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately 295 or 25 basis points compared to 2016  the negative impact was driven by other international operations partially offset by positive impacts attributable to our canadian operations 

comparable sales 

comparable sales increased 4 during 2017  and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency and to a lesser extent an increased average ticket the average ticket and comparable sales results were positively impacted by an increase in gasoline prices offset by decreases in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar changes in comparable sales includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations 

2016  vs 2015 

net sales 

net sales increased 2407  or 2  during 2016 this was attributable to sales at new warehouses opened in 2015 and 2016 comparable sales were flat changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately 2690 or 237 basis points compared to 2015 the negative impact was primarily attributable to our canadian operations and within certain of our other international 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

operations changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by approximately 2194 or 193 basis points due to a 19 decrease in the average sales price per gallon 

comparable sales 

comparable sales were flat during 2016 with an increase in shopping frequency offset by a decrease in the average ticket the average ticket and comparable sales results were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and a decrease in gasoline prices changes in comparable sales includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations 

membership fees 



2017  vs 2016 

the increase in membership fees was primarily due to membership signups at existing and new warehouses an extra week of membership fee revenue the annual fee increase discussed below and an increased number of upgrades to our higherfee executive membership program at the end of 2017  our member renewal rates were 90  in the us and canada and 87  worldwide 

in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 we increased our annual membership fees in certain of our other international operations effective june 1 2017 we also increased our annual membership fees in the us and canada for gold star individual business and business addon by 5 to 60 and for executive membership from110 to 120 annual membership fee of 60 plus the executive upgrade of 60 and the maximum 2 reward associated with executive membership increased from 750 to 1000 annually we account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis recognized ratably over the oneyear membership period these fee increases had a positive impact on membership fee revenues during 2017 of approximately 23 and will positively impact the next several quarters we expect these increases to positively impact membership fee revenue by approximately 175 in fiscal 2018 

2016  vs 2015 

the increase in membership fees was primarily due to membership signups at existing and new warehouses and increased upgrades to our higherfee executive membership program these increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which negatively impacted fees by approximately 52 in 2016

gross margin 



2017  vs 2016 

the gross margin of our core merchandise categories food and sundries hardlines softlines and fresh foods when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales rather than total net sales increased eight basis points due to increases in these categories other than fresh foods this measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses 

total gross margin percentage decreased two basis points compared to 2016 excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 1140 an increase of five basis points this increase was primarily due to amounts earned under the cobranded credit card arrangement in the us of 15 basis points and a benefit of three basis points from nonrecurring legal settlements and other matters the improvement in terms in our current cobrand agreement as compared to the prior cobrand arrangement led to substantial year over year benefits in fiscal 2017 changes of comparable magnitude will not occur in subsequent years these increases were partially offset by a six basis point decrease in our core merchandise categories primarily due to food and sundries as a result of a decrease in sales penetration the gross margin percentage was also negatively impacted by five basis points due to a lifo benefit in 2016 and one basis point in warehouse ancillary and other businesses changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar had an immaterial impact on gross margin in 2017 

gross margin on a segment basis when expressed as a percentage of the segments own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales segment gross margin percentage increased in our us operations due to amounts earned under the cobranded credit card arrangement and nonrecurring legal settlements and other matters as discussed above these increases were partially offset by a decrease in core merchandise categories predominantly food and sundries as a result of a decrease in sales penetration and a lifo benefit in 2016 the segment gross margin percentage in our canadian operations increased primarily due to increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses primarily our pharmacy business partially offset by a decrease in our core merchandise categories largely fresh foods the segment gross margin percentage increased in our other international operations due to increases across all core merchandise categories except fresh foods 

2016  vs 2015 

the gross margin of our core merchandise categories when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales increased 13 basis points primarily due to increases in these categories other than fresh foods 

total gross margin percentage increased 26 basis points compared to 2015 excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 1114 an increase of five basis points a larger lifo benefit in 2016 compared to 2015 positively contributed three basis points the lifo benefit resulted largely from lower costs for merchandise inventories primarily in food and sundries and gasoline our core merchandise categories positively contributed one basis point primarily due to an increase in hardlines partially offset by food and sundries due to a decrease in sales penetration warehouse ancillary and other business gross margin positively contributed one basis point primarily due to hearing aids and ecommerce businesses partially offset by our gasoline business changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 286 in 2016 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

segment gross margin percentage increased in our us operations predominantly due to a positive contribution from our core merchandise categories primarily hardlines and softlines and the lifo benefit discussed above the segment gross margin percentage in our canadian operations decreased primarily due to a decrease in all core merchandise categories except hardlines partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses primarily pharmacy and ecommerce businesses the segment gross margin percentage in other international operations decreased in all merchandise categories except fresh foods which was higher 

selling general and administrative expenses 



2017  vs 2016 

sga expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 14 basis points compared to 2016 excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales sga expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 1033 a decrease of seven basis points operating costs related to warehouses ancillary and other businesses which includes ecommerce and travel were lower by nine basis points primarily due to lower costs associated with the cobranded credit card arrangement in the us of 18 basis points the improvement in terms in our current cobrand agreement as compared to the prior cobrand arrangement led to substantial year over year benefits in fiscal 2017 changes of comparable magnitude will not occur in subsequent years this was partially offset by higher payroll and employee benefit expenses of 11 basis points primarily in our us operations central operating costs were higher by one basis point primarily due to increased costs associated with our information systems modernization including increased depreciation for projects placed in service incurred by our us operations stock compensation expense was also higher by one basis point changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar had an immaterial impact in 2017 

2016  vs 2015 

sga expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 33 basis points compared to 2015 excluding the negative impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales sga expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales were 1020 an increase of 13 basis points this was largely due to higher central operating costs of six basis points predominantly due to costs associated with our information systems modernization including increased depreciation for projects placed in service incurred by our us operations and higher stock compensation expense of four basis points due to appreciation in the trading price of our stock at the time of grant charges for nonrecurring legal and regulatory   matters during 2016 negatively impacted sga expenses by two basis points operating costs related to warehouses ancillary and other businesses which includes ecommerce and travel were higher by one basis point due to higher payroll and employee benefit costs primarily health care i n our us operations this increase was partially offset by lower payroll expense as a percentage of net sales in our canadian operations changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar decreased our sga expenses by approximately 211 in 2016 

preopening expenses 



item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses including relocations development in new international markets and expansions at existing warehouses in 2017 we entered into two new international markets iceland and france preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings the timing of the opening relative to our yearend whether the warehouse is owned or leased and whether the opening is in an existing new or international market 

interest expense 



interest expense primarily relates to senior notes issued by the company described in further detail under the heading “cash flows from financing activities” and in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

interest income and other net

foreigncurrency transaction gains losses net include the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities and marktomarket adjustments for forward foreignexchange contracts by our canadian and other international operations see derivatives and foreign currency sections in item 8 note 1 of this report 

2016  vs 2015   

the decrease in interest income in 2016 is attributable to lower average cash and investment balances due in part to the payment of the outstanding principal balance and interest on the 065 senior notes in the second quarter of 2016 

provision for income taxes 



in 2017 and 2015 our provision was favorably impacted by net tax benefits of 104 and 68 respectively primarily due to tax benefits recorded in connection with the may 2017 and february 2015 special cash dividends paid to employees through our 401k retirement plan of 82 and 57 respectively these dividends are deductible for us income tax purposes

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents 



our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 5779  and 4729  at the end of 2017  and 2016  respectively of these balances approximately 1255 and 1071 represented unsettled credit and debit card receivables respectively these receivables generally settle within four days cash and cash equivalents were positively impacted by changes in exchange rates of 25  and 50  in 2017  and 2016 respectfully and negatively impacted by 418 in 2015 

we have not provided for us deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of certain nonus consolidated subsidiaries including the remaining undistributed earnings of our canadian operations because our subsidiaries have invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely or the earnings if repatriated would not result in an adverse tax consequence although we have historically asserted that certain nonus undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested we may repatriate such earnings to the extent we can do so without an adverse tax consequence if we determine that such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested deferred taxes to the extent required and applicable are recorded at that time during 2017 we changed our position regarding an additional portion of the undistributed earnings of our canadian operations as we determined such earnings could be repatriated without adverse tax consequences subsequent to the end of 2017 we repatriated a portion of our undistributed earnings in our canadian operations without adverse tax consequences 

management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future we believe that our us current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our us liquidity requirements and have no current plans to repatriate for use in the us cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by nonus consolidated subsidiaries whose earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held at these subsidiaries with earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled 1463 at september 3 2017 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 6726  in 2017  compared to 3292  in 2016  our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise vendors warehouse operating costs including payroll and employee benefits utilities and credit and debit card processing fees cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 when compared to 2016 was primarily due to accelerated vendor payments of approximately 1700 made in the last week of fiscal 2016 in advance of implementing our modernized accounting system 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 2366  in 2017  compared to 2345  in 2016  cash flow used in investing activities is primarily related to funding warehouse expansion and remodeling net cash flows from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of shortterm investments

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 3218  in 2017  compared to 2419  in 2016  the primary uses of cash in 2017 were related to dividend payments predominantly the special dividend paid in may 2017 and the repayments of debt totaling 2200 representing the aggregate principal balances of the 55 and 1125 senior notes net cash used in financing activities in 2016 includes a 1200 repayment of our 065 senior notes in december 2015 

in may 2017 we issued 3800 in aggregate principal amount of senior notes the proceeds received were net of a discount and used to pay the special cash dividend and a portion of the redemption of the 1125 senior notes 

stock repurchase programs 

during 2017  and 2016  we repurchased 2998000  and 3184000  shares of common stock at average prices of 15787  and 14990  totaling approximately 473  and 477  respectively the remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was 2749  at the end of 2017  these amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year purchases are made from timetotime as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under sec rule 10b51 repurchased shares are retired in accordance with the washington business corporation act

cash dividends paid in 2017  totaled 890 per share which included a special cash dividend of 700 per share as compared to 170 per share in 2016  in april 2017  our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from 045 to 050 per share 

bank credit facilities and commercial paper programs 

we maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes at september 3 2017 we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of 833 including a 400 revolving line of credit entered into by our us operations in june 2017 with an expiration date of one year the company currently has no plans to draw upon the new revolving line of credit our international operations maintain 349 of the total borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities of which 166 is guaranteed by the company there were no outstanding shortterm borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2017 and 2016 

the company has letter of credit facilities for commercial and standby letters of credit totaling 181 the outstanding standby letters of credit under these facilities at the end of 2017 totaled 103 and expire within one year the bank credit facilities have various expiration dates all within one year and we generally intend to renew these facilities prior to their expiration the amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit then outstanding

contractual obligations 

at september 3 2017  our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows   



 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the opinion of management we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements other than operating leases included in the table above and discussed in note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires that we make estimates and judgments including those related to revenue recognition merchandise inventory valuation impairment of longlived assets insuranceselfinsurance liabilities and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates for further information on significant accounting policies see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

revenue recognition 

we generally recognize sales which includes gross shipping fees where applicable net of returns at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services when we collect payment from members prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services the amount is generally recorded as deferred sales in the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends and reduce sales and merchandise costs accordingly our sales returns reserve is based on an estimate of the net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned amounts collected from members for sales and value added taxes are recorded on a net basis 

we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or a net amount generally when we are the primary obligor subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers influence product or service specifications or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded on a gross basis if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above we record a net amount which is reflected in net sales 

we account for membership fee revenue net of refunds on a deferred basis whereby revenue is recognized ratably over one year our executive members qualify for a 2 reward on qualified purchases up to a maximum reward of approximately 1000 per year in the us and canada and varies in our other international operations which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses we account for this reward as a reduction in sales the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of nonredemptions based on historical data 

merchandise inventories 

merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market us merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting using the lastin firstout lifo basis the company believes the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues the company records an adjustment each quarter if necessary for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at yearend after actual inflation rates and inventory levels for the year have been determined canadian and other international merchandise inventories are predominantly valued using the cost and retail inventory methods respectively using the firstin firstout fifo basis 

we provide for estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales the provision is adjusted to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters 

inventory cost where appropriate is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones terms of agreement or using other systematic approaches 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets for impairment on an annual basis when relocating or closing a facility or when events or changes in circumstances occur that may indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their thencurrent fair value 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

insuranceselfinsurance liabilities 

we are predominantly selfinsured with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks for employee health care benefits workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors’ and officers’ liability vehicle liability and inventory loss we use different mechanisms including a whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary and participate in a reinsurance program liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment also is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these positions and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate our cumulative foreign undistributed earnings except the additional portion of earnings in canada were considered indefinitely reinvested as of september 3 2017  these earnings would be subject to us income tax if we changed our position and could result in a us deferred tax liability although we have historically asserted that certain nonus undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested we may repatriate such earnings to the extent we can do so without an adverse tax consequence

 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in millions 

our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents as defined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report as well as shortterm investments in government and agency securities and asset and mortgagebacked securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields the majority of our shortterm investments are in fixed interest rate securities these securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations 

our policy limits investments in the us to direct us government and government agency obligations repurchase agreements collateralized by us government and government agency obligations and us government and government agency money market funds our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary invests in us government and government agency obligations and us government and government agency money market funds our canadian and other international subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds bankers’ acceptances and bank certificates of deposit generally denominated in local currencies 

a 100 basispoint change in interest rates as of the end of 2017  would have an incremental change in fair market value of 20 for those investments that are classified as availableforsale the unrealized gains or 

item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in millions  continued 

losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 

the nature and amount of our longterm debt may vary as a result of business requirements market conditions and other factors as of the end of 2017  the majority of our longterm debt has fixed interest rates and is carried at 6632  fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixedrate debt see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for more information on our longterm debt 

foreign currencyexchange risk 

our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in their nonfunctional currencies which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates we manage these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreignexchange contracts seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a nonfunctional foreigncurrency the contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the us dollar currently these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting we seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions these contracts do not contain any creditriskrelated contingent features 

we seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships there can be no assurance that this practice is effective these contracts are limited to less than one year see note 1 and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreignexchange contracts at the end of 2017  and 2016  a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the functional currency compared to the nonfunctional currency exchange rates at september 3 2017  would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by 69 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume particularly electricity and natural gas which we seek to partially mitigate through fixedprice contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities predominantly in the us and canada we also enter into variablepriced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis these contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no marktomarket adjustment

 item 9a—controls and procedures 

disclosure controls and procedures 

as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e or 15d15e under the securities and exchange act of 1934 the exchange act based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f or 15d15f of the exchange act during our fiscal quarter ended september 3 2017  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting 

item 9a—controls and procedures continued 

is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us gaap and includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 3 2017  using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework 2013 based on its assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 3 2017  the attestation of kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is included with the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report

 item 1—business 

costco wholesale corporation and its subsidiaries costco or the company began operations in 1983 in seattle washington we are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the united states us and puerto rico canada united kingdom uk mexico japan australia spain and through majorityowned subsidiaries in taiwan and korea costco operated 715  686 and 663 warehouses worldwide at august 28 2016 august 30 2015 and august 31 2014 respectively our common stock trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “cost” 

we report on a 5253week fiscal year consisting of thirteen fourweek periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august the first three quarters consist of three periods each and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53week year the material seasonal impact in our operations is an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season references to 2016 2015 and 2014 relate to the 52week fiscal years ended august 28 2016 august 30 2015 and august 31 2014 respectively 

general 

we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and privatelabel products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins net sales less merchandise costs than most other retailers we generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it even while taking advantage of early payment discounts when available to the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid more inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital 

we buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a crossdocking consolidation point depot or directly to our warehouses our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to our individual warehouses this process maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional multiplestep distribution channels 

item 1—business continued 

our average warehouse space is approximately 144000 square feet with newer units slightly larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices our warehouses are not elaborate by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format we have limited inventory losses shrinkage to amounts well below those of typical discount retail operations 

marketing activities for new locations generally include community outreach to local businesses in new and existing markets and direct mail to prospective new members ongoing promotional programs primarily relate to coupon mailers the costco connection a magazine we publish for our members and promotional emails to members 

our warehouses on average operate on a sevenday 70hour week gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities thereby reducing labor required in general with variations by country our warehouses accept certain debit and credit cards cobranded costco credit cards cash or checks 

our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of highquality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere we seek to limit specific items in each product line to fastselling models sizes and colors we carry an average of approximately 3700 active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business significantly less than other broadline retailers many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise on certain electronic items we typically have a 90day return policy and provide free of charge technical support services as well as an extended warranty additional thirdparty warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items 

we offer merchandise in the following categories 

 ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently we sell gasoline in all countries except mexico korea and taiwan and operated 508 472 and 445 gas stations at the end of 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively ancillary businesses also include optical dispensing centers food courts and hearingaid centers 

our online businesses which include ecommerce business delivery and travel operate websites in all countries except japan australia and spain they provide our members additional products and services typically not found in our warehouses net sales for our online business were approximately 4 of our net sales in 2016 and 3 in 2015 and 2014 respectively 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brandname merchandise we do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier we generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of 

item 1—business continued 

our business we also purchase private label merchandise as long as quality and member demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to brandname items 

certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

membership 

our members may utilize their memberships at any of our warehouses worldwide gold star memberships are available to individuals business memberships are limited to businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or other evidence of business existence business members have the ability to add additional cardholders addons addons are not available for gold star members our annual fee for these memberships is 55 in our us and canadian operations and varies by country in our other international operations all paid memberships include a free household card 

our member renewal rate was 90  in the us and canada and 88  on a worldwide basis in 2016  the majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date therefore our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date 

our membership was made up of the following in thousands 



paid cardholders are eligible to upgrade to an executive membership in the us and canada for an additional annual fee of 55 and in mexico and the uk for which the additional annual fee varies executive members earn a 2 reward on qualified purchases up to a maximum reward of 750 per year in our us and canadian operations and varies in our other international operations which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses this program also offers except in mexico additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services such as auto and home insurance the costco auto purchase program and check printing services the services are generally provided by thirdparties and vary by state and country executive members represented 39  of paid cardholders at the end of 2016  2015  and 2014  executive members generally spend more than other members and where executive memberships are offered the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase 

labor 

our employee count was as follows 



approximately 15000  employees in a minority of our locations are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters we consider our employee relations to be very good 

item 1—business continued 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection location and customer service we compete on a worldwide basis with global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenters department and specialty stores gasoline stations internet retailers and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise competitors such as walmart target kroger and amazoncom are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors we also compete with warehouse club operations primarily walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club and nearly every major us metropolitan area has multiple club operations 

intellectual property 

we believe that to varying degrees our trademarks trade names copyrights proprietary processes trade secrets patents trade dress domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success we have invested significantly in the development and protection of our wellrecognized brands including the costco wholesale ®  series of trademarks and our private label brand kirkland signature ®  we believe that kirkland signature products are premium products offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for similar national brand products and that they help lower costs differentiate our merchandise offerings from other retailers and generally earn higher margins we expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private label items 

we rely on trademark and copyright laws trade secret protection and confidentiality license and other agreements with our suppliers employees and others to protect our intellectual property rights the availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained 

available information

 item 1a—risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks are not the only risks that we face we could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial these risk factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with management  s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item   7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item   8 of this report 

business and operating risks 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our us and canadian operations 

our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our us and canadian operations which comprised 87 and 84 of net sales and operating income in 2016 respectively within the us we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 31 of us net sales in 2016 our california market in general has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our us operations particularly in california and our canadian operations could arise from among other things slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales comparable sales negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor healthcare and energy costs failing to meet targets for warehouse openings cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values and failing to consistently provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members 

we may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy including expanding our business both in existing markets and in new markets which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth is dependent in part on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and regional depots we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing leasing and operating our warehouses and depots we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms in addition certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us within their jurisdictions failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability 

we seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect comparable sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses 

we also intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us attracting members of other wholesale club operators our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence we cannot ensure that our new warehouses and new websites will be profitably deployed and as a result our future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

our failure to maintain membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations 

membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business model the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of our executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable sales diminish member trust and reduce member renewal rates and accordingly net sales and membership fee revenue negatively impacting our results of operations 

in addition we sell many products under our private label kirkland signature brand maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of our kirkland signature products for our members is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty these products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products carried in our warehouses and represent a growing portion of our overall sales if the kirkland signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected 

disruptions in our depot operations could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction 

we depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process primarily through our depots although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires tornadoes and hurricanes earthquakes or other catastrophic events labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions compile results and manage our business failure or disruption of our primary and backup systems could adversely affect our business a failure to adequately update our existing systems and implement new systems could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations 

given the very high volume of transactions we process each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes and errors by our employees if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to improve or replace critical information systems and processing failure to monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace would be harmful the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from the technology targeting the wrong opportunities failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations additionally the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of memberrelated and other business information we could damage our reputation with members incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

we receive retain and transmit personal information about our members and entrust that information to thirdparty business associates including cloud service providers that perform activities for us our warehouse and online businesses depend upon the secure transmission of encrypted confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems or those of our business associates that results in our members   information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could disrupt our operations 

the use of data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the national and state or local level in all of our operating countries   privacy and information security laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations our reputation could be damaged possibly resulting in lost future business and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of noncompliance 

our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties employee error internal or external malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques timely discover or counter them or implement adequate preventative measures any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to paymentrelated risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash and checks a select variety of credit and debit cards and our proprietary cash card as we offer new payment options to our members we may be subject to additional rules regulations compliance requirements and higher fraud losses for certain payment methods we pay interchange and other related card acceptance fees along with additional transaction processing fees we rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services including the processing of credit and debit cards and our proprietary cash card and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to payment card association rules and network operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change over time for example we are subject to payment card industry data security standards “pci dss” which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of individual cardholder data as of october 1 2015 the payment card industry shifted the liability of certain credit card transactions to retailers who are not able to process europay mastercard visa “emv” chip enabled card transactions as a result before our implementation of the evm technology is complete we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks or other third parties for fraudulent transactions initiated through emv chip enabled cards before our implementation of emv chip technology implementation of the emv chip technology and receipt of final certification is subject to hardware installation software modification and certification with our thirdparty transaction service providers if we fail to comply with these rules or transaction processing requirements we may not be able to accept certain payment methods in addition if our internal systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card reissuance costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit andor debit card payments from our members and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

we might sell unsafe products resulting in illness or injury to our members harm to our reputation and litigation 

if our merchandise offerings including food and prepared food products for human consumption drugs children  s products pet products and durable goods do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members   expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and legal and reputational losses the sale of these items involves the risk of healthrelated illness or injury to our members such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects substances chemicals other agents or residues introduced during the growing manufacturing storage handling and transportation phases or faulty design our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards while we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness or injury in the future or that we will not be subject to claims lawsuits or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued related negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be long term 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will desire our success depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly we may have excess inventory which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance this could have an adverse effect on net sales gross margin and operating income 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our members our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors our members especially younger members are increasingly using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media as part of our multichannel strategy we are making technology investments in our websites and mobile applications if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant memberfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

inability to attract train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations merchandising and administrative personnel and the loss of these contributions could have a material adverse effect on our business we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous external factors including regulatory changes prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

market and other external risks 

we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for members employees sites products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local regional and national wholesalers and retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries including other warehouse club operators supermarkets supercenters department and specialty stores gasoline stations and internet retailers such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise pricing selection and availability services location convenience store hours and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications the evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop with digital devices which has enhanced competition some competitors may have greater financial resources better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

higher energy and gasoline costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs consumer debt levels foreigncurrency exchange rates unsettled financial markets weaknesses in housing and real estate markets reduced consumer confidence changes related to government fiscal and tax policies sovereign debt crises and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell prices of certain commodity products including gasoline and other food products are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations taxes and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins these factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results general economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events 

vendors may be unable to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner or may fail to adhere to our high standards resulting in adverse effects on our business merchandise inventories sales and profit margins 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices as these quantities continue to grow we have no assurances of continued supply pricing or access to new products and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us member demands may lead to outofstock positions of our merchandise leading to loss of sales and profits 

we purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited particularly for certain food items the large volume we demand may not be consistently available 

our suppliers and those they depend upon for materials and services are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity inclement weather natural disasters supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise for these or other reasons one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control legal regulatory labor environmental or animal welfare standards these deficiencies 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members this failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands increase our costs and otherwise adversely impact our business 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

during 2016 our international operations including canada generated 27 and 39 of our net sales and operating income respectively our international operations have accounted for an increasingly larger portion of our warehouses and we plan to continue expanding them our operations in countries other than the us are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period future fluctuations in currency exchange rates over time that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our canadian and other international operating segments and have a corresponding adverse periodoverperiod effect on our results of operations as we continue to expand internationally our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase 

we may pay for products we purchase for sale in our warehouses around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold currency fluctuations may increase our cost of goods and may not be passed on to members consequently fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes typhoons or earthquakes particularly in california or washington state where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located could negatively affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots within the countries in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses public health issues whether occurring in the us or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or members or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels these events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations increased us and foreign government and agency regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs that could materially affect our profitability in addition climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience we also sell a substantial amount of gasoline the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which also could face increased regulation climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels extreme weather conditions increase our costs and resulting damage to our properties may not be fully insured 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable sales growth rates membership renewal rates gross margin earnings earnings per share new warehouse openings or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

legal and regulatory risks 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

during 2016 we operated 214 warehouses in eight countries outside of the us and we plan to continue expanding our international operations future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many similar to those we face in the us certain of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions economic conditions regulatory constraints currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the us and foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the us risks inherent in international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 

accounting principles and related pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition merchandise inventories vendor rebates and other vendor consideration impairment of longlived assets selfinsurance liabilities and income taxes are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 

provisions for losses related to selfinsured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in health care cost inflation rates inherent in these claims can affect the amounts recognized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as changes in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate as the tax rates vary among countries a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision additionally changes in the enacted tax rates adverse outcomes in tax audits including transfer pricing disputes or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

significant changes in or failure to comply with federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters failure to comply with these laws could result in significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance remediation or compensatory requirements or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards fines penalties and remediation costs we are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits including grand jury investigations government and agency investigations and consumer employment tort unclaimed property laws and other litigation see discussion of legal proceedings in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item   8 of this report we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities the outcome of some of these legal proceedings audits unclaimed property laws and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management  s attention and resources

overview 

we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth particularly comparable sales growth we define comparable sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year including remodels relocations and expansions as well as online sales related to websites operating for more than one year comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit average ticket sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions primarily impacting our us and canadian operations the higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business especially the united states sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread across a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our private label items 

our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at the most competitive prices we do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values our investments in merchandise pricing can from time to time include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members all negatively impacting nearterm gross margin as a percentage of net sales gross margin percentage we believe that our gasoline business draws members but it generally has a significantly lower gross margin percentage relative to our nongasoline business a higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our nearterm net sales growth generally rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which given the higher sales base negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales a decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect 

we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses as our warehouse base grows available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth the negative aspects of such growth however including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets are increasingly less significant relative to the results of our total operations our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to continue our online business growth both domestically and internationally has also increased our sales 

our membership format is an integral part of our business model and has a significant effect on our profitability this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase penetration of our executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability 

our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically some significant costs are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility expenses with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits rather we believe that 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

achieving our longerterm objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business is operated on very low margins modest changes in various items in the income statement particularly merchandise costs and selling general and administrative expenses can have substantial impacts on net income 

our operating model is generally the same across our us canada and other international operating segments see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report certain countries in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth lower wages and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales andor less or no direct membership warehouse competition additionally we operate our lowermargin gasoline business in all countries except mexico korea and taiwan 

in discussions of our consolidated operating results we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which are references to the differences between the foreignexchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars for financial reporting purposes this impact of foreignexchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current periods currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current periods average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period 

our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to august 31 fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  were 52week fiscal years ending on august 28 2016  august 30 2015  and august 31 2014  respectively certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding unless otherwise noted references to net income relate to net income attributable to costco

results of operations 

net sales 



2016 vs 2015 

net sales 

net sales increased 2407  or 2  during 2016 this was attributable to sales at new warehouses opened in 2015 and 2016 comparable sales were flat changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately 2690 or 237 basis points compared to 2015 the negative impact was attributable to most foreign countries in which we operate predominantly canada of 1646 mexico of 550 and uk of 224 changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by approximately 2194 or 193 basis points due to a 19 decrease in the average sales price per gallon 

comparable sales 

comparable sales were flat during 2016 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency offset by a decrease in the average ticket the average ticket and comparable sales results were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and a decrease in gasoline prices changes in comparable sales also includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations 

2015 vs 2014

membership fees 



2016 vs 2015 

the increase in membership fees was primarily due to membership signups at existing and new warehouses and increased number of upgrades to our higherfee executive membership program these increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which negatively impacted membership fees by approximately 52 in 2016 at the end of 2016 our member renewal rates were 90  in the us and canada and 88  worldwide 

2015 vs 2014 

membership fees increased 4 in 2015 this increase was primarily due to membership signups at existing and new warehouses and increased number of upgrades to our higherfee executive membership program these increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which negatively impacted membership fees by approximately 76 in 2015 

gross margin 



2016 vs 2015 

the gross margin of our core merchandise categories food and sundries hardlines softlines and fresh foods when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales rather than total net sales increased 13 basis points primarily due to increases in these categories other than fresh foods this measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses 

total gross margin percentage increased 26 basis points compared to 2015 excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 1114 an increase of five basis points a larger lifo benefit in 2016 compared to 2015 positively contributed three basis points the lifo benefit resulted largely from lower costs for merchandise inventories primarily in food and sundries and gasoline our core merchandise categories positively contributed one basis point primarily due to an

increase in hardlines partially offset by food and sundries due to a decrease in sales penetration warehouse ancillary and other business gross margin positively contributed one basis point primarily due to hearing aids and ecommerce businesses partially offset by our gasoline business changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 286 in 2016 

gross margin on a segment basis when expressed as a percentage of the segments own sales and excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales segment gross margin percentage increased in our us operations predominately due to a positive contribution from our core merchandise categories primarily hardlines and softlines and the lifo benefit discussed above the segment gross margin percentage in our canadian operations decreased primarily due to a decrease in all core merchandise categories except hardlines partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses primarily pharmacy and ecommerce businesses the segment gross margin percentage in other international operations decreased in all merchandise categories except fresh foods which was higher 

2015 vs 2014 

the gross margin of our core merchandise categories food and sundries hardlines softlines and fresh foods when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales increased five basis points primarily due to increases in softlines and food and sundries partially offset by a decrease in fresh foods 

our gross margin percentage increased 43 basis points compared to 2014 and most of the improvement was derived from the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales excluding this impact gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 1081 an increase of 15 basis points from the prior year this increase was predominantly due to an increase in our warehouse ancillary and other business gross margin of 23 basis points due primarily to our gasoline business partially offset by a negative contribution from core merchandise categories of 12 basis points as a result of a decrease in their sales penetration a lifo benefit in 2015 compared to a charge in 2014 positively contributed five basis points the lifo benefit resulted largely from lower costs of gasoline changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 359 in 2015 

segment gross margin percentage increased in our us operations primarily due to our gasoline business and the lifo benefit discussed above the segment gross margin percentage in our canadian operations decreased across our core merchandise categories the segment gross margin percentage in our other international operations decreased primarily in food and sundries 

selling general and administrative expenses 



2016 vs 2015 

sga expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 33 basis points compared to 2015 excluding the negative impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales sga expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales were 1020 an increase of 13 basis points this was largely due to higher central operating costs of six basis points predominantly due to costs associated with our information systems modernization including increased depreciation for projects placed in service incurred by our us operations and higher stock compensation expense of four basis points due to appreciation in the trading price of our stock at the time of grant our investment in modernizing our information systems is ongoing and expected to continue to negatively impact sga expenses charges for nonrecurring legal and regulatory   matters during 2016 negatively impacted sga expenses by two basis points our warehouse operating costs were higher by one basis point due to higher payroll and employee benefit costs primarily health care i n our us operations this increase was partially offset by lower payroll expense as a percentage of net sales in our canadian 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

operations changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar decreased our sga expenses by approximately 211 in 2016 

2015 vs 2014 

sga expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 18 basis points mostly due to the negative impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales excluding this impact sga expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales were 982 an improvement of seven basis points this was due to lower warehouse operating costs of 16 basis points primarily from improvements in payroll expenses in our core business as a result of leveraging increased sales this improvement was partially offset by higher central operating costs of five basis points predominantly due to increased depreciation and service contract costs associated with our information systems modernization projects that were placed into service during the year primarily incurred by our us operations higher stock compensation expense also negatively impacted our sga expenses by four basis points due to an appreciation in the trading price of our stock at the time of grant changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar decreased our sga expenses by approximately 282 in 2015 

preopening expenses 



preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses including relocations development in new international markets and expansions at existing warehouses preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings the timing of the opening relative to our yearend whether the warehouse is owned or leased and whether the opening is in an existing new or international market 

interest expense 



interest expense in 2016 primarily relates to senior notes issued by the company described in further detail under the heading “cash flows from financing activities” and in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report the increase in interest expense is primarily due to the senior notes issued in february 2015 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

interest income and other net 



2016 vs 2015 

the decrease in interest income in 2016 is attributable to lower average cash and investment balances due in part to the payment of the outstanding principal balance and interest on the 065 senior notes in the second quarter of 2016 see discussion in item 8 note 4 of this report foreigncurrency transaction gains net include marktomarket adjustments for forward foreignexchange contracts and the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our canadian and other international operations see derivatives and foreign currency sections in item 8 note 1 of this report 

2015 vs 2014 

the increase in net foreigncurrency transaction gains was primarily attributable to favorable marktomarket adjustments for forward foreign exchange contracts compared to the prior year the increase was also attributable to net gains on the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities during the year 

provision for income taxes 



in 2015 our provision was favorably impacted by net tax benefits of 68 primarily due to a tax benefit recorded in connection with a special cash dividend paid to employees through our 401k retirement plan dividends paid on these shares are deductible for us income tax purposes 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents 



our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 4729  and 6419  at the end of 2016 and 2015 respectively of these balances approximately 1071 and 1243 at the end of 2016 and 2015 respectively represented unsettled credit and debit card receivables these receivables generally settle within one week cash and cash equivalents were positively impacted by changes in exchange rates by 50  in 2016 and negatively impacted by 418  and 11 in 2015 and 2014 respectively 

we have not provided for us deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of certain nonus consolidated subsidiaries including the remaining undistributed earnings of our canadian operations because our subsidiaries have invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely or the earnings

if repatriated would not result in an adverse tax consequence although we have historically asserted that certain nonus undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested we may repatriate such earnings to the extent we can do so without an adverse tax consequence if we determine that such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested deferred taxes to the extent required and applicable are recorded at that time during 2016 we repatriated the earnings in our canadian operations that in 2015 were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested subsequent to the end of the fiscal year we determined that a portion of the undistributed earnings in our canadian operations could be repatriated without adverse tax consequences accordingly we no longer consider that portion to be indefinitely reinvested 

management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future we believe that our us current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our us liquidity requirements and have no current plans to repatriate for use in the us cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by these nonus consolidated subsidiaries whose earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held at these subsidiaries with earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled 1535 at august 28 2016 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 3292  in 2016 compared to 4285  in 2015 our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise vendors warehouse operating costs including payroll and employee benefits credit and debit card processing fees and utilities cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2016 when compared to 2015 was primarily due to accelerated vendor payments of approximately 1700 made in the last week of fiscal 2016 in advance of implementing our modernized accounting system at the beginning of fiscal 2017

capital expenditure plans 

we opened 29 new warehous es and relocated four warehouses in 2016  and plan to open up to 31 new warehouses and relocate up to three warehouses in 2017 our primary requirement for capital is acquiring land buildings and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses to a lesser extent capital is required for initial warehouse operations the modernization of our information systems and working capital in   2016   we spent 2649 on capital expenditures and it is our current intention to spend approximately 2600 to 2800 during fiscal   2017    these expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs

contractual obligations 

as of august 28 2016  our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows   



 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the opinion of management we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements other than the operating leases included in the table above and discussed in note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires that we make estimates and judgments including those related to revenue recognition merchandise inventory valuation impairment of longlived assets insuranceselfinsurance liabilities and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and we continue to review and evaluate these statements for further information on significant accounting policies see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition 

we generally recognize sales which include shipping fees where applicable net of returns at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services when we collect payment from members prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services the amount is generally 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

recorded as deferred sales in the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends and reduce sales and merchandise costs accordingly our sales returns reserve is based on an estimate of the net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned amounts collected from members for sales and value added taxes are recorded on a net basis 

we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or a net amount generally when we are the primary obligor subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers influence product or service specifications or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded on a gross basis if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above we record a net amount which is reflected in net sales we record related shipping fees on a gross basis 

we account for membership fee revenue net of refunds on a deferred basis whereby revenue is recognized ratably over one year our executive members qualify for a 2 reward on qualified purchases up to a maximum reward of approximately 750 per year in the us and canada and varies in our other international operations which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses we account for this reward as a reduction in sales the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of nonredemptions based on historical data 

merchandise inventories 

merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method and are stated using the lastin firstout lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the firstin firstout fifo method we record an adjustment each quarter if necessary for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at yearend we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues 

we provide for estimated inventory losses shrink between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales the provision is adjusted to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year 

inventory cost where appropriate is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones terms of agreement or other systematic approaches 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets for impairment on an annual basis when relocating or closing a facility or when events or changes in circumstances occur that may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group generally an individual warehouse may not be fully recoverable our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their thencurrent fair value 

insuranceselfinsurance liabilities 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including for certain risks a whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance program to provide for potential liabilities for workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors’ and officers’ liability vehicle liability and employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these positions and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate additionally our cumulative foreign undistributed earnings were considered indefinitely reinvested as of august 28 2016 these earnings would be subject to us income tax if we changed our position and could result in a us deferred tax liability although we have historically asserted that certain nonus undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested we may repatriate such earnings to the extent we can do so without an adverse tax consequence

 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in millions 

our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents as defined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report as well as shortterm investments in government and agency securities and asset and mortgagebacked securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields the majority of our shortterm investments are in fixed interest rate securities these securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations 

our policy limits investments in the us to direct us government and government agency obligations repurchase agreements collateralized by us government and government agency obligations and us government and government agency money market funds our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary invests in us government and government agency obligations corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgagebacked securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of aa our canadian and other international subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds bankers’ acceptances and bank certificates of deposit generally denominated in local currencies 

a 100 basispoint change in interest rates as of the end of 2016  would have an incremental change in fair market value of 22 for those investments that are classified as availableforsale the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 

the nature and amount of our longterm debt may vary as a result of business requirements market conditions and other factors as of the end of 2016 the majority of our longterm debt is fixed rate senior notes carried at 4390  fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixedrate debt see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for more information on our longterm debt 

item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in millionscontinued 

foreign currencyexchange risk 

our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in their nonfunctional currencies which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates we manage these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreignexchange contracts seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a nonfunctional foreigncurrency the contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the us dollar currently these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting we seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions these contracts do not contain any creditriskrelated contingent features 

we seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships there can be no assurance that this practice is effective these contracts are limited to less than one year see note 1 and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreignexchange contracts at the end of 2016  and 2015  a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the functional currency compared to the nonfunctional currency exchange rates at august 28 2016  would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by 56 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume particularly electricity and natural gas which we seek to partially mitigate through fixedprice contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities predominately in the us and canada we also enter into variablepriced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis these contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no marktomarket adjustment

item 9a—controls and procedures continued 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us gaap and includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation

 item 1—business 

costco wholesale corporation and its subsidiaries costco or the company began operations in 1983 in seattle washington we are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the united states us and puerto rico canada united kingdom uk mexico japan australia spain and through majorityowned subsidiaries in taiwan and korea our common stock trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “cost” 

we report on a 5253week fiscal year consisting of thirteen fourweek periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august the first three quarters consist of three periods each and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53week year the material seasonal impact in our operations is an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season references to 2015 2014 and 2013 relate to the 52week fiscal years ended august 30 2015 august 31 2014 and september 1 2013 respectively 

general 

we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and privatelabel products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than most other retailers we generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it even while taking advantage of early payment discounts when available to the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid more inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital 

we buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a crossdocking consolidation point depot or directly to our warehouses our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses this process maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional multiplestep distribution channels 

item 1—business continued 

our average warehouse space is approximately 144000 square feet however our newer units tend to be slightly larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices our warehouses are not elaborate by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format we have limited inventory losses shrinkage to amounts well below those of typical discount retail operations 

marketing activities for new locations generally include community outreach programs to local businesses in new and existing markets and direct mail to prospective new members ongoing promotional programs primarily relate to coupon mailers the costco connection a magazine we publish for our members and emails to members promoting selected merchandise 

our warehouses on average operate on a sevenday 70hour week gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities thereby reducing labor required in general with variations by country our warehouses accept cash checks certain debit and credit cards or a private label costco credit card 

our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere we seek to limit specific items in each product line to fastselling models sizes and colors we carry an average of approximately 3700 active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business significantly less than other broadline retailers many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise on certain electronic items we typically have a 90day return policy and provide free of charge technical support services as well as an extended warranty additional thirdparty warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic item purchasesthe following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by major category of items 



  

ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently the following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal yearend 



  

item 1—business continued 

our online business which operates websites in the us canada uk and mexico provides our members additional products many not found in our warehouses these products vary by country and include services such as photo processing pharmacy travel business delivery and membership services net sales for our online business were approximately 3 of our net sales in each of the last three fiscal years 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brandname merchandise we do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier we generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business we also purchase private label merchandise as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to brandname items 

certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

membership 

our format allows our members to utilize their memberships at any of our worldwide costco warehouse locations we have two types of members gold star individual and business gold star memberships are available to individuals business memberships are limited to businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or other evidence of business existence business members have the ability to add additional cardholders addons addons are not available for gold star members our annual fee for these memberships is 55 in our us and canadian operations and varies by country in our other international operations all paid memberships include a free household card 

our member renewal rate was approximately 91  in the us and canada and approximately 88  on a worldwide basis in 2015  the renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date the majority of members renew within the six months following their renewal date 

our membership was made up of the following in thousands 



all gold star and business paid cardholders are eligible to upgrade to an executive membership in the us canada mexico and uk for an additional annual fee of approximately 55 our executive members qualify for a 2 reward on qualified purchases up to a maximum reward of approximately 750 per year which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses this program also offers except in mexico additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services such as auto and home insurance the costco auto purchase program and check printing services the services are generally provided by thirdparties and vary by country and state executive members represented 39  of eligible cardholders at the end of 2015 and 2014 and 38  at the end of 2013  executive members generally spend more than other members and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase 

item 1—business continued 

labor 

our employee count was as follows 



approximately 14000  employees in a minority of our locations are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters all remaining employees are nonunion we consider our employee relations to be very good 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection location and customer service we compete with warehouse club operations across the us and mexico primarily walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club and nearly every major metropolitan area has multiple club operations in addition we compete on a worldwide basis with global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenters department and specialty stores gasoline stations and internet retailers competitors such as walmart target kroger and amazoncom are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors we also compete with operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such as lowe’s home depot office depot petsmart staples kohl’s trader joe’s whole foods cvs walgreens and best buy 

intellectual property 

we believe that to varying degrees our trademarks trade names copyrights proprietary processes trade secrets patents trade dress domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success we have invested significantly in the development and protection of our wellrecognized brands including the costco wholesale ®  series of trademarks and our private label brand kirkland signature ®  we believe that kirkland signature products are premium products offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for similar national brand products and that they help lower costs differentiate our merchandise offerings from other retailers and generally earn higher margins we expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private label items 

we rely on trademark and copyright laws trade secret protection and confidentiality license and other agreements with our suppliers employees and others to protect our intellectual property rights the availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained

 item 1a—risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks are not the only risks that we face we could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial these risk factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with management  s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item   7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item   8 of this report 

business and operating risks 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our us and canadian operations 

our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our us and canadian operations which comprised 88 and 85 of net sales and operating income in 2015 respectively within the us we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 31 of us net sales in 2015 our california market in general has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our us operations particularly in california and our canadian operations could arise from among other things declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor healthcare and energy costs failing to meet targets for warehouse openings cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values and failing to consistently provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members 

we may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy including expanding our business both in existing markets and in new markets which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth is dependent in part on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and regional depots we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing leasing and operating our warehouses and depots we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms in addition certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us within their jurisdictions failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively may affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses and depots which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability 

we seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses 

we intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets the risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us attracting members of other wholesale club operators our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence we cannot ensure that our new warehouses and new online business websites will be profitably deployed and as a result our future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations 

membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business model the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of our executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales diminish member trust and reduce member renewal rates and accordingly net sales and membership fee revenue negatively impacting our results of operations 

in addition we sell many products under our private label kirkland signature brand maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of our kirkland signature products for our members is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty these products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products carried in our warehouses and represent a growing portion of our overall sales if the kirkland signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected 

disruptions in our depot operations could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction 

we depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process primarily through our depots although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires hurricanes earthquakes or other catastrophic events labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business failure to adequately update our systems and disruptions in both our primary and backup systems could harm our ability to run our business and adversely affect our results of operations 

given the very high volume of transactions we process each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes and errors by our employees if our computer systems or our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to improve or replace our information processes and systems that are key to managing our business failure to monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace would be harmful the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process can mitigate this risk excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from the technology targeting the wrong opportunities failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations additionally the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of memberrelated and other business information we could damage our reputation with members incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

we receive retain and transmit certain personal information about our members and entrust that information to third party business associates including cloud service providers that perform activities for us our online

the use of data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the national and state or local level in all of our operating countries   privacy and information security laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach our reputation could be damaged possibly resulting in lost future business and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of noncompliance 

our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information in july 2015 we discovered that the company that hosts our online photo center suffered a security breach that compromised information of users of the companys site including some costco members in response that company implemented new technology with enhanced security features additional data security breaches may occur in the future and may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business and operations because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques timely discover or counter them or implement adequate preventative measures any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to payment related risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash and checks a select variety of credit and debit cards and our proprietary cash card as we offer new payment options to our members we may be subject to additional rules regulations compliance requirements and higher fraud losses for certain payment methods we pay interchange and other related card acceptance fees along with additional transaction processing fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services including the processing of credit and debit cards and our proprietary cash card and it could temporarily disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to payment card association rules and network operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change over time if we fail to comply with these rules or transaction processing requirements we may not be able to accept certain payment methods in addition if our internal systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for banks compromised card reissuance costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit andor debit card payments from our members and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we might sell unsafe products resulting in illness or injury to our members harm our reputation and litigation 

if our merchandise offerings including food and prepared food products for human consumption drugs children  s products pet products and durable goods do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members   expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and legal and reputational losses the sale of these items involves the risk of healthrelated illness or injury to our members such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects substances chemicals other

agents or residues introduced during the growing manufacturing storage handling and transportation phases or faulty design our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards while we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness or injury in the future or that we will not be subject to claims lawsuits or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be long term 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will desire our success depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly we may have excess inventory which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance this could have an adverse effect on gross margin net sales less merchandise costs and operating income 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our members our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors our members especially younger members are increasingly using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to shop as part of our multichannel strategy we are making technology investments in our websites and mobile applications if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant memberfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our inability to attract train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations merchandising and administrative personnel and the loss of these contributions could have a material adverse effect on our business we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous external factors including regulatory changes prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

market and other external risks 

we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for customers employees sites products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local regional and national wholesalers and retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries including other warehouse club operators supermarkets 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

supercenters department and specialty stores gasoline stations and internet retailers such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise pricing selection and availability services location convenience and store hours the evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop with digital devices which has enhanced competition some competitors may have greater financial resources better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

higher energy and gasoline costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs consumer debt levels foreign currency exchange rates unsettled financial markets weaknesses in housing and real estate markets reduced consumer confidence changes related to government fiscal and tax policies sovereign debt crises and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell prices of certain commodity products including gasoline and other food products are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations taxes and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins these factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results general economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events 

vendors may be unable to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner or may fail to adhere to our high standards resulting in adverse effects on our business merchandise inventories sales and profit margins 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices as these quantities continue to grow we have no assurances of continued supply pricing or access to new products and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us member demands may lead to outofstock positions of our merchandise leading to loss of sales and profits 

we purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited particularly for certain food items the large volume we demand may not be consistently available 

our suppliers and those they depend upon for materials and services are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity inclement weather natural disasters supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise for these or other reasons one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control legal regulatory or animal welfare standards these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members this failure could lead to litigation and recalls which could damage our reputation and our brands increase our costs and otherwise adversely impact our business 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations

item 1a—risk factors continued 

countries other than the us are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the results of operations of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as a result of such translations future fluctuations in currency exchange rates over time that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our canadian and other international operating segments and have a corresponding adverse periodoverperiod effect on our results of operations as we continue to expand our international operations our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase 

we may pay for products we purchase for sale in our warehouses around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold currency fluctuations may increase our cost of goods and may not be passed on to members consequently fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes typhoons or earthquakes particularly in california or in washington state where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located could negatively affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots within the countries in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses public health issues whether occurring in the us or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or members or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels these events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations increased us and foreign government and agency regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs that could materially affect our profitability in addition climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience we also sell a substantial amount of gasoline the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which also could face increased regulation climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels extreme weather conditions increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured 

failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates gross margin earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase policies 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

legal and regulatory risks 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

during 2015 we operated 206 warehouses in eight countries outside of the us and we plan to continue expanding our international operations future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many similar to those we face in the us certain of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions economic conditions regulatory constraints currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the us and foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the us risks inherent in international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 

accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition merchandise inventories vendor rebates and other vendor consideration impairment of longlived assets selfinsurance liabilities and income taxes are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 

provisions for losses related to selfinsured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate as the tax rates vary among countries a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision additionally changes in the enacted tax rates adverse outcomes in connection with income tax audits in any jurisdiction including transfer pricing disputes or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

significant changes in or failure to comply with federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations

overview 

we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth particularly comparable warehouse sales comparable sales growth we define comparable sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year including remodels relocations and expansions as well as online sales related to websites operating for more than one year comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit average ticket sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions primarily impacting our us and canadian operations the higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business especially the united states sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread across a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our private label items 

our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at the most competitive prices we do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values our investments in merchandise pricing can from time to time include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members all negatively impacting nearterm gross margin as a percentage of net sales gross margin percentage we believe that our gasoline business draws members but it generally has a significantly lower gross margin percentage relative to our nongasoline business a higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our nearterm net sales growth generally rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which given the higher sales base negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales a decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect 

we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses as our warehouse base grows available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth the negative aspects of such growth however including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets are increasingly less significant relative to the results of our total operations our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to continue our online business growth both domestically and internationally has also increased our sales 

our membership format is an integral part of our business model and has a significant effect on our profitability this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase penetration of our executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability 

our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically some significant costs are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility expenses with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn rather we believe that achieving our longerterm objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business is operated on very low margins modest changes in various items in the income statement particularly gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses can have substantial impacts on net income 

our operating model is generally the same across our us canada and other international operating segments see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report certain countries in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth lower wages and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales andor less or no direct membership warehouse competition additionally we operate our lowermargin gasoline business in the us canada australia uk and japan 

in discussions of our consolidated operating results we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which are references to the differences between the foreignexchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars for financial reporting purposes this impact of foreignexchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prioryear periods currency exchange rates we also refer to the impact of changes in gasoline prices on our net sales this impact is calculated based on the difference between the current periods average gasoline price per gallon sold and the comparable prioryear periods average gasoline price per gallon sold

net sales 

net sales increased 3454 or 3 during 2015 this was attributable to sales at new warehouses opened in 2014 and 2015 and a 1 increase in comparable warehouse sales changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately 3344 or 303 basis points compared to 2014 the negative impact was attributable to all foreign countries in which we operate predominantly canada of 2027 mexico of 385 and japan of 368 changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by approximately 2902 or 263 basis points due to a 22 decrease in the average sales price per gallon

membership fees 



2015 vs 2014 

membership fees increased 4 in 2015 this increase was primarily due to membership signups at existing and new warehouses and increased number of upgrades to our higherfee executive membership program these increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which negatively impacted membership fees by approximately 76 in 2015 our member renewal rates are currently 91 in the us and canada and 88 worldwide 

2014 vs 2013 

membership fees increased 6 in 2014 this increase was primarily due to membership signups at existing and new warehouses and increased number of upgrades to our higherfee executive membership program the raising of our membership fees in fiscal 2012 positively impacted 2014 and 2013 by 9 and 119 respectively these increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which negatively impacted membership fees by approximately 35 in 2014

gross margin 



2015 vs 2014 

during 2015 the gross margin of our combined core merchandise categories food and sundries hardlines softlines and fresh foods when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales rather than total net sales increased five basis points primarily due to increases in softlines and food and sundries partially offset by a decrease in fresh foods this measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses 

our gross margin percentage increased 43 basis points compared to 2014 and most of the improvement was derived from the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales excluding this impact gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 1081 an increase of 15 basis points from the prior year this increase is predominantly due to an increase in our warehouse ancillary and other business gross margin of 23 basis points due primarily to our gasoline business partially offset by a negative contribution from core merchandise categories of 12 basis points as a result of a decrease in their sales penetration a lifo benefit in 2015 compared to a charge in 2014 positively contributed five basis points the lifo benefit resulted largely from lower costs for gasoline changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 359 in 2015 

gross margin on a segment basis when expressed as a percentage of the segments own sales segment gross margin percentage increased in our us operations primarily due to our gasoline business food and sundries merchandise category and the lifo benefit discussed above the segment gross margin percentage in our canadian operations decreased primarily in hardlines and softlines the segment gross margin percentage in our other international operations decreased primarily in food and sundries 

2014 vs 2013 

during 2014 the gross margin of our combined core merchandise categories when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales increased seven basis points primarily due to increases in our softlines and food and sundries categories partially offset by a decrease in hardlines fresh foods also had a positive impact as a result of higher sales penetration 

our gross margin percentage increased four basis points compared to 2013 and most of the improvement was derived from the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales excluding this impact gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 1063 an increase of one basis point from the prior year this increase is predominantly due to warehouse ancillary and other business gross margin of six basis points which was largely offset by five basis points due to a lifo charge in 2014 compared to a benefit in 2013 the lifo charge resulted from higher costs for our merchandise inventories primarily our foods and fresh foods categories changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 151 in 2014

selling general and administrative expenses 



2015 vs 2014 

sga expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 18 basis points mostly due to the negative impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales excluding this impact sga expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales were 982 an improvement of seven basis points this was due to lower warehouse operating costs of 16 basis points primarily from improvements in payroll expenses in our core business as a result of leveraging increased sales this improvement was partially offset by higher central operating costs of five basis points predominantly due to increased depreciation and service contract costs associated with our information systems modernization projects that were placed into service during the year primarily incurred by our us operations our investment in modernizing our information systems is ongoing higher stock compensation expense also negatively impacted our sga expenses by four basis points due to an appreciation in the trading price of our stock at the time of grant changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar decreased our sga expenses by approximately 282 in 2015

sga expenses as a percentage of net sales increased seven basis points excluding the effect of gasoline price deflation on net sales sga expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales were 986 an increase of four basis points this increase was largely due to an increase in central operating costs of three basis points primarily due to continued investment in modernizing our information systems primarily incurred by our us operations stock compensation expense was also higher by two basis points due to accelerated vesting for long service and appreciation in the trading price of our stock at the time of grant despite a 14 reduction in the average number of restricted stock units rsus granted to each participant warehouse operating costs were lower by one basis point primarily resulting from improvements in payroll in our canadian operations as a result of leveraging increased sales partially offset by increases in employee benefit costs primarily health care in our us operations changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar decreased our sga expenses by 119 in 2014 

preopening expenses 



  

 preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses development in new international markets and expansions at existing warehouses preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings the timing of the opening relative to our yearend whether the warehouse is owned or leased and whether the opening is in an existing new or international market

interest expense 



interest expense in 2015 primarily relates to 1100 of 55 senior notes issued in fiscal 2007 3500 of senior notes issued in december 2012 and 1000 of senior notes issued in february 2015 described in further detail under the heading “cash flows from financing activities” and in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

interest income and other net 



2015 vs 2014 

the increase in net foreigncurrency transaction gains was primarily attributable to favorable marktomarket adjustments for forward foreign exchange contracts compared to the prior year see derivatives and foreign currency sections in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report the increase was also attributable to net gains on the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities during the year 

2014 vs 2013 

the increase in interest income in 2014 was primarily driven by higher average cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balances primarily in our us operations the decrease in net foreigncurrency transaction gains was primarily attributable to the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and monetary liabilities during the year primarily our japanese subsidiarys us dollardenominated payables 

provision for income taxes 



our provision for income taxes in 2015 and 2013 were favorably impacted by net tax benefits of 68 and 77 respectively primarily due to tax benefits recorded in connection with special cash dividends paid to employees through our 401k retirement plan dividends paid on these shares are deductible for us income tax purposes there was no similar special cash dividend in 2014 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents 



our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 6419 and 7315 at the end of 2015 and 2014 respectively of these balances approximately 1243 and 1383 at the end of 2015 and 2014 respectively represented debit and credit card receivables primarily related to sales in the last week of our fiscal year cash and cash equivalents were negatively impacted by changes in exchange rates by 418 and 11 respectively 

we have not provided for us deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of certain nonus consolidated subsidiaries because our subsidiaries have invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely or the earnings if repatriated would not result in a deferred tax liability this includes the remaining undistributed earnings of our canadian operations that management maintains are indefinitely reinvested or could be repatriated without resulting in a deferred tax liability deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of our foreign operations when we determine that such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested 

during 2015 we repatriated a portion of the earnings in our canadian operations that in 2014 were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested in the fourth quarter of 2015 we changed our position regarding an additional portion of the undistributed earnings of our canadian operations which are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested current exchange rates compared to historical rates when these earnings were generated resulted in an immaterial us tax benefit which was recorded at the end of 2015 

management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future we believe that our us current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our us liquidity requirements and have no current plans to repatriate for use in the us cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by these nonus consolidated subsidiaries whose earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held at these subsidiaries and considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled 1196 at august 30 2015 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 4285 in 2015 compared to 3984 in 2014 our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees our cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise vendors warehouse operating costs including payroll and employee benefits credit card processing fees and utilities cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 when compared to 2014 was primarily due to stronger earnings 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 2480 in 2015 compared to 2093 in 2014 our cash flow used in investing activities is primarily related to funding our warehouse expansion and remodeling activities net cash flows from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of shortterm investments 

capital expenditure plans 

we opened 23 new warehous es relocated two warehouses and converted an existing warehouse to a business center in 2015 and plan to open up to 32 new warehouses in 2016 and relocate up to five 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

warehouses our primary requirement for capital is acquiring land buildings and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses to a lesser extent capital is required for initial warehouse operations the modernization of our information systems and working capital in 2015 we spent 2393 on capital expenditures and it is our current intention to spend approximately 2800 to 3000 during fiscal 2016   these expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 2324 in 2015 compared to 786 in 2014 the primary uses of cash in 2015 were dividend payments of 2865 which includes a 500 per share special cash dividend repurchases of common stock and payment of withholding taxes on stockbased awards net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by the issuance of 1000 in senior notes 

in february 2015 we issued 1000 in aggregate principal amount of senior notes as follows 500 of 175 senior notes due february 15 2020 and 500 of 225 senior notes due february 15 2022 the proceeds were used to pay a portion of the special cash dividend on february 27 2015 

stock repurchase programs 

in april 2015 our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of 4000 which expires in april 2019 this authorization revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling 2528 during 2015 and 2014 we repurchased 3456000 and 2915000 shares of common stock at an average price of 14287 and 11445 totaling approximately 494 and 334 respectively the remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was 3699 at the end of 2015 purchases are made from timetotime as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under sec rule 10b51 repurchased shares are retired in accordance with the washington business corporation act 

dividends 

our cash dividends paid in 2015  totaled 651 per share as compared to 133 per share in 2014  in april 2015 our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from 0355 to 040 per share additionally in 2015 our board of directors declared and paid a special cash dividend of 500 per share totaling approximately 2201 

bank credit facilities and commercial paper programs 

we maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes at august 30 2015 we had borrowing capacity within these facilities of 407 of which 337 was maintained by our international operations of the 337 153 is guaranteed by the company there were no outstanding shortterm borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2015 and 2014 

the company has letter of credit facilities for commercial and standby letters of credit totaling 149 the outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2015 totaled 90 including 89 in standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year the bank credit facilities have various expiration dates all within one year and we generally intend to renew these facilities prior to their expiration the amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit then outstanding

contractual obligations 

as of august 30 2015  our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows   



 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that in the opinion of management have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires that we make estimates and judgments including those related to revenue recognition merchandise inventory valuation impairment of longlived assets insuranceselfinsurance liabilities and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and we continue to review and evaluate these statements for further information on significant accounting policies see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition 

we generally recognize sales which include shipping fees where applicable net of returns at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services the amount is generally recorded as deferred sales in the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends and reduce sales and merchandise costs 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

accordingly our sales returns reserve is based on an estimate of the net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned amounts collected from members for sales and value added taxes are recorded on a net basis 

we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or a net amount generally when we are the primary obligor subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers influence product or service specifications or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded on a gross basis if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above we record a net amount which is reflected in net sales we record related shipping fees on a gross basis 

we account for membership fee revenue net of refunds on a deferred basis whereby revenue is recognized ratably over oneyear our executive members qualify for a 2 reward on qualified purchases up to a maximum reward of approximately 750 per year which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses we account for this reward as a reduction in sales the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of nonredemptions based on historical data 

merchandise inventories 

merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method and are stated using the lastin firstout lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories we record an adjustment each quarter if necessary for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at yearend we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the firstin firstout fifo method 

we provide for estimated inventory losses shrink between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year 

inventory cost where appropriate is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones terms of agreement or other systematic and rational approaches 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets for impairment on an annual basis when relocating or closing a facility or when events or changes in circumstances occur that may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group generally an individual warehouse may not be fully recoverable our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their thencurrent fair value 

insuranceselfinsurance liabilities 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including for certain risks a whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance program to provide for potential liabilities for workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors’ and officers’ liability vehicle liability and employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment is required in assessing the 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities additionally certain of our cumulative foreign undistributed earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested these earnings would be subject to us income tax if we changed our position and could result in a us deferred tax liability when facts and circumstances change we reassess these positions and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in millions 

our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents as defined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report as well as shortterm investments in government and agency securities and asset and mortgagebacked securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields the majority of our shortterm investments are in fixed interest rate securities these securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations 

our board of directors have approved a policy that limits investments in the us to direct us government and government agency obligations repurchase agreements collateralized by us government and government agency obligations and us government and government agency money market funds our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary invests in us government and government agency obligations corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgagebacked securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of aa 

our canadian and other international subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds bankers’ acceptances and bank certificates of deposit generally denominated in their local currencies 

we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a 100 basispoint change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio at the end of 2015  the incremental change in the fair market value was 27 for those investments that are classified as availableforsale the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 

the nature and amount of our longterm debt may vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors as of the end of 2015 the majority of our longterm debt is fixed rate senior notes carried at 5596 fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixedrate debt see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for more information on our longterm debt 

foreign currencyexchange risk 

our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in their nonfunctional currencies which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates we manage these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreignexchange contracts seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a nonfunctional foreigncurrency the contracts are intended primarily 

item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in millionscontinued 

to economically hedge exposure to us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the us dollar currently these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting we seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions these contracts do not contain any creditriskrelated contingent features 

while we seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships there can be no assurance that this practice is effective these contracts are limited to less than one year in duration see note 1 and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreignexchange contracts at the end of 2015  and 2014  a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the functional currency compared to the nonfunctional currency exchange rates at august 30 2015  would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by 88 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume particularly electricity and natural gas which we seek to partially mitigate through fixedprice contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities predominately in the us and canada we also enter into variablepriced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis these contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no marktomarket adjustment

 item 9a—controls and procedures 

disclosure controls and procedures 

as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e or 15d15e under the securities and exchange act of 1934 the exchange act based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f or 15d15f of the exchange act during our fiscal quarter ended august 30 2015 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us gaap and includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of august 30 2015  using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework 2013 based on its assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of august 30 2015  the attestation of kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is included with the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 








 item 9b—other information 

on february 27 2015 we entered into a cobranded credit card program agreement the “program agreement” with citibank na “citi” under the terms of the program agreement citi would become the exclusive issuer of our cobranded credit cards to new and existing members of the company and visa usa inc would replace american express as the credit card network for costco in the united states and puerto rico our current expectation is that citi will purchase the current cobranded credit card portfolio from american express by april 1 2016 and begin issuing visa cards by the summer of 2016 we would receive various forms of consideration under the program agreement the initial term of the program agreement is ten years 

the most significant expected revenue provided to costco from citi under the cobrand credit card program is the percentage or royalty on external spend purchases made with the cobranded card other than from costco that percentage will vary based primarily on the amount of external spend over the term of the program costcos royalty revenue will also be impacted by the nature and extent of the loyalty rewards to be provided to cardholders under the program primarily by citi but also partially by costco under certain circumstances the amount and character of the loyalty rewards have yet to be determined and may be adjusted over the term of the program 

the next most significant expected benefit to costco is the reduction in the base discount rate — the fee costco is charged for accepting the cobranded credit card costcos cost of acceptance of the cobranded credit card will be lower than the cost that costco bears currently 

the loyalty rewards earned by cobranded cardholders are expected to be in the form of certificates redeemable at costco for cash or merchandise based on prior experience costco expects that most cardholders will redeem the certificates for merchandise resulting in a benefit to net sales and gross margin on those transactions 

costco will also receive benefits from citi in the form of a bounty on new credit card accounts costco sources assistance in increasing membership marketing assistance staff support and potentially a share of any profits of the program

general 

we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and select privatelabel products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers mass merchandisers supermarkets and supercenters we generally sell inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors even though we take advantage of early payment discounts when available to the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid more inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital 

we buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a crossdocking consolidation point depot or directly to our warehouses our depots receive containerbased shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses generally in less than twentyfour hours this process maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional multiplestep distribution channels such traditional steps include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers use of central receiving storing and distributing warehouses and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor 

our average warehouse is approximately 144000 square feet however our newer units tend to be slightly larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices our warehouses are not elaborate facilities by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format we have limited inventory losses shrinkage to amounts well below those of typical discount retail operations 

marketing activities generally include community outreach programs to local businesses in new and existing markets and direct mail to prospective new members ongoing promotional programs primarily relate to coupon mailers the costco connection a magazine we publish for our members and emails to members promoting selected merchandise 

our warehouses generally operate on a sevenday 69hour week open weekdays between 1000 am and 830 pm with earlier weekend closing hours gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities thereby reducing labor required in general with variations by country our warehouses accept cash checks certain debit and credit cards or a private label costco credit card 

our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere we seek to limit specific items in each product line to fastselling models sizes and colors we carry an average of approximately 3700 active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business as opposed to a significantly higher number of skus at other retailers many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise on certain electronic items we typically have a 90day return policy and provide free of charge technical support services as well as an extended warranty additional thirdparty warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic item purchases 

item 1—business continued 

the following table indicates the approximate percentage of annual net sales accounted for by major category of items 



  

ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently the following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal yearend 



  

our online business which operates websites in the us canada uk and mexico provides our members additional products many not found in our warehouses these products vary by country and include services such as photo processing pharmacy travel business delivery and membership services net sales for our online business were approximately 3 of our consolidated net sales 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brandname merchandise we do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business we also purchase private label merchandise as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to brandname items 

certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

membership 

our format allows our members to utilize their memberships at any of our worldwide costco warehouse locations we have two types of members gold star individual and business gold star memberships are available to individuals to purchase products for personal use business memberships are limited to businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or other evidence of business existence business members have the ability to add additional cardholders addons for an annual fee addons are not available for gold star members our annual fee for these memberships is 55 in our us and canadian operations and varies by country in our other international operations all paid memberships include a free household card 

our member renewal rate was approximately 91  in the us and canada and approximately 87  on a worldwide basis in 2014  the renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date this method captures the annual membership cycle as the majority of members renew within the six months following their renewal date 

item 1—business continued 

our membership was made up of the following in thousands 



all gold star and business paid cardholders are eligible to upgrade to an executive membership in the us canada mexico and uk for an annual fee of approximately 110 our executive members qualify for a 2 reward on qualified purchases up to a maximum of approximately 750 per year which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses this program also offers except in mexico additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services such as auto and home insurance the costco auto purchase program and check printing services the services are generally provided by thirdparties and vary by country and state at the end of 2014  executive members represented 39  of eligible cardholders while they represented 38  at the end of both 2013  and 2012  executive members generally spend more than other members and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase 

labor 

our employee count was as follows 



approximately 14000  employees in certain of our locations in five  states are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters all remaining employees are nonunion we consider our employee relations to be very good 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection location and customer service we compete with warehouse club operations across the us and mexico primarily walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club and nearly every major metropolitan area has multiple club operations in addition we compete on a worldwide basis with global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenters department and specialty stores gasoline stations and internet retailers competitors such as walmart target kohl’s and amazoncom are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors we also compete with operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such as lowe’s home depot office depot petsmart staples kroger trader joe’s whole foods cvs walgreens and best buy 

intellectual property

 item 1a—risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks are not the only risks that we face we could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial these risk factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with management  s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item   7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item   8 of this report 

business and operating risks 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our us and canadian operations 

our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our us and canadian operations which comprised 87 and 83 of consolidated net sales and operating income in 2014 respectively within the us we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 32 of us net sales in 2014 our california market in general has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our us operations particularly in california and our canadian operations could arise from among other things declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor healthcare and energy costs failing to meet targets for warehouse openings cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values and failing to consistently provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members 

we may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy including expanding our business both in existing markets and in new markets which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our growth is dependent in part on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing leasing and operating our warehouses we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms in addition certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us within their jurisdictions failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively may affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability 

we seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses 

we intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets the risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us attracting members of other wholesale club operators currently operating in the new market our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence in new markets we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed and as a result our future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations 

membership loyalty is essential to our business model the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of our executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales diminish member trust and reduce member renewal rates and accordingly membership fee revenues negatively impacting our results of operations 

in addition we sell many products under our owned and exclusive kirkland signature brand maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of our kirkland signature products for our members is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty these products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

a growing portion of our overall sales if the kirkland signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected 

disruptions in our depot operations could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction 

we depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process primarily through our depots although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires hurricanes earthquakes or other catastrophic events labor shortages or shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business failure to adequately update our systems and disruptions in both our primary and backup systems could harm our ability to run our business and adversely affect our results of operations 

given the very high volume of transactions we process each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes and errors by our employees if our computer systems or our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to improve or replace our information processes and systems that are key to managing our business we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process can mitigate this risk excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from the technology targeting the wrong opportunities failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations additionally the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of memberrelated and other business information we could damage our reputation with members incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

we receive retain and transmit certain personal information about our members and entrust that information to third party business associates including cloud service providers who perform activities for us our online business which operates websites in the us canada uk and mexico depends upon the secure transmission of encrypted confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems or those of our business associates that results in our members   personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations 

additionally the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the national and local or state level in all of our operating countries   privacy and information security laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach our reputation could be damaged possibly resulting in lost future business and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of noncompliance 

our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques timely discover them or implement adequate preventative measures any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

we are subject to payment related risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash and checks a select variety of credit and debit cards and our proprietary cash card as we offer new payment options to our members we may be subject to additional rules regulations compliance requirements and higher fraud losses for certain payment methods we pay interchange and other related card acceptance fees along with additional transaction processing fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services including the processing of credit and debit cards and our proprietary cash card and it could temporarily disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to payment card association rules and network operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change over time if we fail to comply with these rules or transaction processing requirements we may not be able to accept certain payment methods in addition if our internal systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for banks compromised card reissuance costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit andor debit card payments from our members and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we are subject to the risks of selling unsafe products which could result in illness or injury to our members harm our reputation and subject us to litigation 

if our merchandise offerings including food and prepared food products for human consumption drugs children  s products pet products and durable goods do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members   expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk the sale of these items involves the risk of healthrelated illness or injury to our members such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects substances chemicals other agents or residues introduced during the growing manufacturing storage handling and transportation phases or faulty design our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards while we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness or injury in the future or that we will not be subject to claims lawsuits or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be long term 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will desire our success depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including those relating to sustainability of product sources and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly we may have excess inventory which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance this could have an adverse effect on margins net sales less merchandise costs and operating income 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our members our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors our members are increasingly using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to shop online as part of our multichannel strategy we are making technology investments in our websites and mobile applications if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant memberfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our inability to attract train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations merchandising and administrative personnel and the loss of these contributions could have a material adverse 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

effect on our business we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified employees while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous external factors including regulatory changes prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

market and other external risks 

we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for customers employees sites products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local regional and national wholesalers and retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries including other warehouse club operators supermarkets supercenters department and specialty stores gasoline stations and internet retailers such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise pricing selection and availability services location convenience and store hours the evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop with digital devices which has enhanced competition some competitors may have greater financial resources better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

higher energy and gasoline costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs consumer debt levels foreign currency exchange rates unsettled financial markets weaknesses in housing and real estate markets reduced consumer confidence changes related to government fiscal and tax policies sovereign debt crises and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell prices of certain commodity products including gasoline and other food products are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations taxes and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins these factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results general economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events 

vendors may be unable to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner or may fail to adhere to our high standards resulting in adverse effects on our business merchandise inventories sales and profit margins 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices we have no assurances of continued supply pricing or access to new products and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us member demands may lead to outofstock positions of our merchandise leading to loss of sales and profits 

we purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited particularly for certain food items the large volume we demand may not be consistently available 

our suppliers and those they depend upon for materials and services are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity inclement weather natural disasters supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise for these or other reasons one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control legal or regulatory standards these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members this failure could lead to litigation and recalls which could damage our reputation and our brands increase our costs and otherwise adversely impact our business 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes typhoons or earthquakes particularly in california or in washington state where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located could negatively affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots within the countries in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses public health issues whether occurring in the us or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or members or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels these events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations increased us and foreign government and agency regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs that could materially affect our profitability in addition climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience we also sell a substantial amount of gasoline the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which also could face increased regulation climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels extreme weather conditions increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured 

failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates margins earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase policies 

legal and regulatory risks 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

during 2014 our international operations including canada generated 28 of our consolidated net sales we plan to continue expanding our international operations as a result of these expansion activities in countries outside the us we expect that our international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many similar to those we face in the us but many of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions economic conditions regulatory constraints currency regulations and exchange rates and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the us and foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the us risks inherent in international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our future costs or on future profits and cash flows from our international operations 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition investments merchandise inventories vendor rebates and other vendor consideration impairment of longlived assets selfinsurance liabilities and income taxes are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 

provisions for losses related to selfinsured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate as the tax rates vary among countries a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision additionally changes in the enacted tax rates adverse outcomes in connection with income tax audits in any jurisdiction including transfer pricing disputes or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

significant changes in or failure to comply with federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters any failure to comply with these laws could result in significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance remediation or compensatory requirements or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards fines and penalties we are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits including grand jury investigations government and agency investigations and consumer employment tort unclaimed property laws and other litigation see discussion of legal proceedings in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item   8 of this report we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities the outcome of some of these legal proceedings audits unclaimed property laws and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management  s attention and resources

overview 

we believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is sales growth particularly comparable sales growth we define comparable warehouse sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year including remodels relocations and expansions as well as online sales related to websites operating for more than one year comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing the shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control including fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions primarily impacting domestic operations the higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business especially the united states sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread including a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenters department and specialty stores gasoline stations and internetbased retailers while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our private label items 

our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at the most competitive prices we do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values our investments in merchandise pricing can from time to time include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members all negatively impacting nearterm gross margin as a percentage of sales we believe our gasoline business draws members to our warehouses but it has a lower gross margin as a percentage of net sales relative to our nongasoline business a higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin as a percentage of net sales 

we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses as our warehouse base grows however available and desirable potential sites become more difficult and potentially more expensive to secure and square footage growth may become a comparatively less substantial component of sales growth the negative aspects of such growth including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets are increasingly less significant relative to the results of our total operations our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to continue 

our membership format is an integral part of our business model and has a significant effect on our profitability this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of our executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability 

our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically some significant costs are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility expenses with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn rather we believe that achieving our longerterm objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business is operated on very low margins modest changes in various items in the income statement particularly gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses can have substantial impacts on net income 

our operating model is generally the same across our us canada and other international operating segments see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report certain countries in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth lower wages and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales andor less direct membership warehouse competition additionally we operate our gasoline business only in the us canada australia and uk 

in discussions of our consolidated operating results we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which are references to the differences between the foreignexchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars for financial reporting purposes this impact of foreign

results of operations 

net sales 



 

 2014 vs 2013 

net sales 

net sales increased 7342 or 7 during 2014 this was attributable to a 4 increase in comparable warehouse sales and sales at warehouses opened in 2013 and 2014 changes in foreign currencies negatively impacted net sales by approximately 1336 or 130 basis points compared to 2013 the negative impact was primarily due to the canadian dollar of approximately 1140 and the japanese yen of approximately 311 changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by approximately 364 or 35 basis points due to a 3 decrease in average sales price per gallon 

comparable sales 

comparable sales increased 4 during 2014 and were primarily impacted by an increase in shopping frequency changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and gasoline prices negatively impacted comparable sales results including the average amount spent by our members during 2014 in local currencies international comparable sales increased 7 9 in canada and 4 in our other international segment the increase in comparable sales also includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations primarily in our other international operations 

2013 vs 2012 

net sales 

net sales increased 5808 or 6 during 2013 this increase was attributable to a 6 increase in comparable warehouse sales and sales at warehouses opened in 2012 and 2013 partially offset by the impact of one additional week of sales in 2012 changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately 208 or 21 basis points during 2013 the negative impact was primarily due to the japanese yen of approximately 354 partially offset by a positive impact of the mexican peso of approximately 127 changes in gasoline prices were immaterial to the change in net sales 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

comparable sales 

comparable sales increased 6 during 2013 and were positively impacted by increases in both shopping frequency and the average amount spent by our members changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and gasoline prices were immaterial to the change in comparable sales the increase in comparable sales includes the negative impact of cannibalization 

membership fees 



2014 vs 2013 

membership fees increased 6 in 2014 this increase was primarily due to membership signups at existing and new warehouses and increased number of upgrades to our higherfee executive membership program the raising of our membership fees in fiscal 2012 positively impacted 2014 by 9 these increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which negatively impacted membership fees by approximately 35 in 2014 our member renewal rates are currently 91 in the us and canada and 87 worldwide 

we increased our annual membership fees in the us and canada effective november 1 2011 for new members and january 1 2012 for renewal members we account for membership fee revenue net of refunds on a deferred basis whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the oneyear membership period 

2013 vs 2012 

membership fees increased 10 in 2013 the increase was primarily due to raising our annual membership fees and membership signups at both existing and new warehouses the fee increase had a positive impact on membership fee revenues of approximately 119 and 37 in 2013 and 2012 respectively these increases were partially offset by the impact of one additional week of membership fees in 2012 

gross margin 



2014 vs 2013 

gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased four basis points gross margin in our core merchandise categories food and sundries hardlines softlines and fresh foods when expressed as a percentage of net sales increased six basis points primarily due to increases in our softlines and food and sundries categories partially offset by a decrease in hardlines fresh foods also had a positive impact as a result of higher sales penetration warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margin when expressed as a percentage of net sales increased by six basis points gross margin as a percentage of net sales was negatively impacted by seven basis points primarily due to a 28 lifo inventory charge in 2014 compared to a 27 benefit in 2013 and a nonrecurring legal settlement that increased gross margin in 2013 the lifo charge resulted from higher costs for our merchandise inventories primarily our foods and fresh foods categories excluding the effect of gasoline price deflation on net sales gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased one basis point changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted gross margin by 151 in 2014 

gross margin in our core merchandise categories when expressed as a percentage of their own merchandise category sales increased seven basis points the changes in the individual merchandise categories are consistent with the discussion above 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

when expressed as a percentage of the segments own sales gross margin increased in our us operations primarily due to our softlines and food and sundries categories partially offset by a decrease in hardlines and the lifo charge and legal settlement discussed above the gross margin percentage in our canadian operations decreased primarily due to decreases in hardlines and food and sundries partially offset by an increase in fresh foods the gross margin percentage in our other international segment increased primarily due to fresh foods 

2013 vs 2012 

gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased seven basis points gross margin in our core merchandise categories when expressed as a percentage of net sales decreased four basis points primarily due to a decrease in fresh foods as a result of our continued investment in merchandise pricing warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margin when expressed as a percentage of net sales increased by six basis points predominately in our optical and hearing aid businesses additionally gross margin was positively impacted by five basis points due to a 27 lifo inventory benefit in 2013 compared to a charge of 21 in 2012 and two basis points due to a legal settlement the lifo benefit resulted from lower costs for our merchandise inventories primarily hardlines executive membership 2 reward program negatively impacted gross margin by two basis points due to increased spending by executive members 

gross margin for core merchandise categories when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales rather than total net sales decreased two basis points primarily due to a decrease in fresh foods 

when expressed as a percentage of the segment’s own sales gross margin increased in our us operations primarily due to improvements in warehouse ancillary and other businesses the lifo benefit and legal settlement also benefited our us operations these improvements were slightly offset by a decrease in fresh foods the gross margin percentage in our canadian operations was flat resulting from a decrease in fresh foods offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses the gross margin percentage in our other international segment decreased primarily in fresh foods 

selling general and administrative expenses 



2014 vs 2013 

sga expenses as a percentage of net sales increased seven basis points excluding the effect of gasoline price deflation on net sales sga expenses as a percentage of net sales increased four basis points this increase was largely due to an increase in central operating costs of three basis points primarily due to continued investment in modernizing our information systems primarily incurred by our us operations stock compensation expense was also higher by two basis points due to accelerated vesting for long service and appreciation in the trading price of our stock despite a 14 reduction in the average number of rsus granted to each participant see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for discussion of accelerated vesting warehouse operating costs were lower by one basis point primarily resulting from improvements in payroll in our canadian operations as a result of leveraging increased sales partially offset by increases in employee benefit costs primarily health care in our us operations changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar decreased our sga expenses by 119 in 2014 

2013 vs 2012 

sga expenses as a percentage of net sales increased one basis point this increase was driven by higher stock compensation expense of three basis points partially offset by contributions made to an initiative reforming alcohol beverage laws in washington state in the first quarter of 2012 with no comparable charge in 2013 which resulted in a positive impact of two basis points central operating costs as a percent of net sales were flat primarily due to the benefit of lower nonequity incentive compensation costs as a result of not meeting certain internal performance targets this was offset by higher central operating costs predominately related to the continued investment in modernizing our information systems primarily incurred by our us operations warehouse operating costs as a percentage of net sales were flat primarily due to leveraging payroll costs in our us and canadian operations as a result of increased net sales which was offset by increases in other operating costs primarily employee benefits and workers compensation

preopening expenses 



preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses development in new international markets and expansions at existing warehouses preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings the timing of the opening relative to our yearend whether the warehouse is owned or leased and whether the opening is in an existing new or international market during the fourth quarter we opened our first warehouse in spain 

interest expense 



interest expense in 2014 primarily relates to our 1100 of 55 senior notes issued in fiscal 2007 and our 3500 of senior notes issued in december 2012 described in further detail under the heading “cash flows from financing activities” and in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

interest income and other net 



2014 vs 2013 

the increase in interest income in 2014 was primarily driven by higher average cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balances primarily in our us operations the decrease in net foreigncurrency transaction gains was primarily attributable to the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and monetary liabilities during the year primarily our japanese subsidiarys us dollardenominated payables see derivatives and foreign currency sections in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

2013 vs 2012 

the decrease in interest income in 2013 was primarily attributable to lower interest rates earned on our us cash balances there was a decrease in the positive impact of net foreigncurrency transaction gains resulting from the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and monetary liabilities during the year this was partially offset by a positive impact of marktomarket adjustments related to foreign exchange contracts entered into by our foreign subsidiaries as the us dollar was slightly stronger in certain international locations compared to 2012 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

provision for income taxes 



our provision for income taxes for 2013 was favorably impacted by nonrecurring net tax benefits of 77 primarily due to a 62 tax benefit recorded in connection with the special cash dividend paid to employees through our 401k retirement plan dividends paid on these shares are deductible for us income tax purposes 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents 



our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 7315 and 6124 at the end of 2014 and 2013 respectively of these balances approximately 1383 and 1254 at the end of 2014 and 2013 respectively represented debit and credit card receivables primarily related to sales in the last week of our fiscal year 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we changed our position regarding a portion of the undistributed earnings of our canadian operations which is no longer considered permanently reinvested current exchange rates compared to historical rates when these earnings were generated resulted in an immaterial us tax liability which was recorded at the end of 2014 canadian withholding taxes which are creditable against federal income taxes have also been accrued on the amount expected to be repatriated 

management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future we have not provided for us deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of certain nonus consolidated subsidiaries as we deem such earnings to be indefinitely reinvested this includes the remaining undistributed earnings of our canadian operations that management continues to assert are indefinitely reinvested we believe that our us current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our us liquidity requirements and have no current plans to repatriate for use in the us cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by these nonus consolidated subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held at these subsidiaries and considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled 1809 at august 31 2014 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 3984 in 2014 compared to 3437 in 2013 our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees our cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise vendors warehouse operating costs including payroll and employee benefits credit card processing fees and utilities cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes 

cash flows from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 2093 in 2014 compared to 2251 in 2013 our cash flow used in investing activities is primarily related to funding our warehouse expansion and remodeling activities net cash flows from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of shortterm investments 

capital expenditure plans 

we opened 30 new warehouses and one new depot in 2014 and plan to open up to 35 new warehouses in 2015 including the relocation of four warehouses   our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land buildings and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses to a lesser extent capital is required for initial warehouse operations the modernization of our 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

information systems and working capital in 2014 we spent 1993 on capital expenditures and it is our current intention to spend approximately 2500 to 2700 during fiscal 2015   these expenditures are expected to be financed with cash to be provided from operations existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs 

cash flows from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 786 in 2014 compared to 44 provided by financing activities in 2013 the primary uses of cash in 2014 were dividend payments repurchases of common stock and payment of withholding taxes on stockbased awards the net cash provided by financing activities in 2013 primarily resulted from the proceeds of the issuance of 3500 in aggregate principal amount of senior notes which were used to fund a onetime special cash dividend of 3049 in december 2012 these cash flows did not recur in 2014 

stock repurchase programs 

during 2014 and 2013 we repurchased 2915000 and 357000 shares of common stock at an average price of 11445 and 9641 totaling approximately 334 and 34 respectively the remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was 2721 at the end of 2014 purchases are made from timetotime as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under sec rule 10b51 repurchased shares are retired in accordance with the washington business corporation act 

dividends 

in april 2014 our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from 031 to 0355 per share our cash dividends paid in 2014  totaled 133 per share as compared to 817 per share in 2013  which included a special cash dividend of 700 per share 

bank credit facilities and commercial paper programs 

we maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes at august 31 2014 we had borrowing capacity within these facilities of 451 of which 381 was maintained by our international operations of the 381 180 is guaranteed by the company there were no outstanding shortterm borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2014 and 36 outstanding at the end of 2013 

the company has letter of credit facilities for commercial and standby letters of credit totaling 154 the outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2014 totaled 95 including 91 in standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year the bank credit facilities have various expiration dates all within one year and we generally intend to renew these facilities prior to their expiration the amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit then outstanding

contractual obligations 

as of august 31 2014  our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows   



 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that in the opinion of management have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires that we make estimates and judgments we continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition investments merchandise inventory valuation impairment of longlived assets insuranceselfinsurance liabilities and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable for further information on significant accounting policies see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition 

we generally recognize sales which include shipping fees where applicable net of returns at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis 

we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned generally when we are the primary obligor subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers influence product or service specifications or have several but not all of these indicators revenue and related shipping fees are recorded on a gross basis if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above we record the net amounts earned which is reflected in net sales 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued 

we account for membership fee revenue net of refunds on a deferred basis whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the oneyear membership period our executive members qualify for a 2 reward on qualified purchases up to a maximum of approximately 750 per year which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses we account for this reward as a reduction in sales the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of nonredemptions based on historical data 

investments 

investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment we employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

merchandise inventories 

merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method and are stated using the lastin firstout lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the firstin firstout fifo method we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues we record an adjustment each quarter if necessary for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at yearend 

we provide for estimated inventory losses shrink between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year 

inventory cost where appropriate is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones terms of agreement or other systematic and rational approaches 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets for impairment on an annual basis when relocating or closing a facility or when events or changes in circumstances occur that may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group generally an individual warehouse may not be fully recoverable our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their thencurrent fair market value 

insuranceselfinsurance liabilities 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including for certain risks a whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance pool to provide for potential liabilities for workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors’ and officers’ liability vehicle liability and employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate

 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in millions 

our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents as defined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report as well as shortterm investments in government and agency securities and asset and mortgagebacked securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields the majority of our shortterm investments are in fixed interest rate securities these securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations 

our board of directors have approved a policy that limits investments in the us to direct us government and government agency obligations repurchase agreements collateralized by us government and government agency obligations and us government and government agency money market funds our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary invests in us government and government agency obligations corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgagebacked securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of aa 

our canadian and other international subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds bankers’ acceptances and bank certificates of deposit generally denominated in their local currencies 

we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a 100 basispoint change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio at the end of 2014  the incremental change in the fair market value was immaterial for those investments that are classified as availableforsale the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 

the nature and amount of our longterm debt may vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors as of the end of 2014 the majority of our longterm debt is fixed rate senior notes carried at 4596 fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixedrate debt see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for more information on our longterm debt 

foreign currencyexchange risk 

our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in their nonfunctional currencies which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates we manage these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreignexchange contracts seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a nonfunctional foreigncurrency the contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the us dollar currently these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting we seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions these contracts do not contain any creditriskrelated contingent features 

while we seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships there can be no assurance that this practice is effective these contracts are limited to less than one year in duration see note 1 and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreignexchange contracts at the end of 2014  and 2013  a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the functional currency compared to the nonfunctional currency exchange rates at august 31 2014  would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by 56 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume particularly electricity and natural gas which we seek to partially mitigate through fixedprice contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities predominately in the us and canada we also enter into variablepriced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas in addition to fuel 

item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in millionscontinued 

for our gas stations on an index basis these contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no marktomarket adjustment

disclosure controls and procedures 

as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e or 15d15e under the securities and exchange act of 1934 the exchange act based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f or 15d15f of the exchange act during our fiscal quarter ended august 31 2014 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us gaap and includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of august 31 2014  using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework 1992 based on its assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of august 31 2014  the attestation of kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is included with the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report

general 

we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and select privatelabel products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover this turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers mass merchandisers supermarkets and supercenters 

we buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a crossdocking consolidation point depot or directly to our warehouses our depots receive containerbased shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses generally in less than twentyfour hours this process maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional multiplestep distribution channels such traditional steps include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers use of central receiving storing and distributing warehouses and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor 

because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover we generally sell inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors even though we take advantage of early payment discounts when available to the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital 

our typical warehouse format averages approximately 143000 square feet newer units tend to be slightly larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices our warehouses are not elaborate facilities by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format we have limited inventory losses shrinkage to amounts well below those of typical discount retail operations 

marketing and promotional activities generally relate to new warehouse openings occasional direct mail to prospective new members and regular direct marketing programs such as the costco connection a magazine we publish for our members coupon mailers emails from costcocom costcoca and costcocouk and handouts to existing members promoting selected merchandise 

our warehouses generally operate on a sevenday 69hour week open weekdays between 1000 am and 830 pm with earlier weekend closing hours gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers discount retailers and supermarkets and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking 

our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere we seek to limit specific items in each product line to fastselling models sizes and colors therefore 

item 1—business continued 

we carry an average of approximately 3700 active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business as opposed to a significantly higher number of skus at discount retailers supermarkets and supercenters many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise on certain electronic items we typically have a 90day return policy and provide free of charge technical support services as well as an extended warranty additional thirdparty warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic item purchases 

the following table indicates the approximate percentage of annual net sales accounted for by major category of items 

  



  

ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently the following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal yearend 

  



  

our online business which operates websites in the us canada and the uk provide our members additional products many not found in our warehouses these products vary by country and include services such as photo center pharmacy travel business delivery and membership services net sales for our online business were approximately 3 of our consolidated net sales 

in general and depending on the country our warehouses accept cash checks certain debit cards american express or a private label costco credit card losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from making further purchases until restitution is made 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brandname merchandise we do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business we also purchase private label merchandise as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to brandname items 

certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report

membership 

our membership format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue members can utilize their membership at any costco warehouse location in any country we have two types of members business and gold star individual business membership is limited to businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or other evidence of business existence business members pay an annual membership fee of approximately 55 for the primary cardholder and have the ability to add additional cardholders addons for an annual fee of approximately 55 each gold star memberships are also available for an annual fee of approximately 55 to individuals who may not qualify for a business membership however addons are not available for gold star memberships all paid memberships include a free household card 

our member renewal rate was approximately 90  in the us and canada and approximately 86  on a worldwide basis in 2013  the renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date

item 1—business continued 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection warehouse location and member service we compete with over 800 warehouse club locations across the us and canada primarily walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club and every major metropolitan area has multiple club operations in addition we compete with a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenter stores department and specialty stores gasoline stations and internetbased retailers competitors such as walmart target kohl’s and amazoncom are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors we also compete with operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such as lowe’s home depot office depot petsmart staples kroger trader joe’s whole foods cvs walgreens and best buy our international operations face similar competition 

intellectual property 

we believe that to varying degrees our trademarks trade names copyrights proprietary processes trade secrets patents trade dress domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important factors in our success we have invested significantly in the development and protection of our wellrecognized brands including the costco wholesale ®  series of trademarks and our private label brand kirkland signature ®  we believe that kirkland signature products are premium products offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for national brand products and that they help lower costs differentiate our merchandise offerings from other retailers and generally earn higher margins we expect to increase the sales penetration of our private label items in the future 

we rely on trademark and copyright laws trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements with our suppliers employees and others to protect our proprietary rights the availability and duration of trademark registrations vary from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained

 item 1a—risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks are not the only risks that we face we could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial you should review these risk factors carefully in conjunction with management  s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item   7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item   8 of this report 

business and operating risks 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our us and canadian operations 

our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our us and canadian operations which comprised 88 and 84 of consolidated net sales and operating income in 2013 respectively within the us we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 23 of consolidated net sales in 2013 our california market in general has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other markets any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our us operations particularly in california and our canadian operations could arise from among other things failing to meet targets for warehouse openings declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor healthcare and energy costs cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values and failing to consistently provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members 

we may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy including expanding our business both in existing markets and in new markets which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of constructing leasing and operating our warehouses we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms in addition certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us within their jurisdictions failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively may affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability 

we seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses 

we also intend to open warehouses in new markets the risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us attracting members of other wholesale club operators currently operating in the new market our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence in new markets we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed and as a result our future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations 

membership loyalty is essential to our business model damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales lower employee morale and productivity diminish member trust and reduce member renewal rates and accordingly membership fee revenues resulting in a reduction in shareholder value 

in addition we sell many products under our owned and exclusive kirkland signature brand maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of our kirkland signature products for our customers is essential to developing and 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

maintaining customer loyalty these products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales if the kirkland signature brand experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected 

disruptions in our depot operations could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction 

we depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process primarily through our depots although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires hurricanes earthquakes or other catastrophic events labor shortages or shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business failure to adequately update our systems and disruptions in both our primary and backup systems could harm our ability to run our business and adversely affect our results of operations 

although we believe that we have independent redundant primary and secondary computer systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes and errors by our employees if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to transform our information processes and systems that are key to managing our business we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from the technology targeting the wrong opportunities failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations additionally the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of memberrelated and business information we could damage our reputation with members incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

we receive retain and transmit certain personal information about our members and entrust that information to third party business associates including cloud service providers who perform these activities for us our online business which operates websites in the us canada and the uk depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems or those of our business associates that results in our members   personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online business 

additionally the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the national and local or state level in all of our operating countries   privacy and information security laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach our reputation could be damaged possibly resulting in lost future business and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of noncompliance 

our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

to implement adequate preventative measures any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to payment related risks 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash and checks various select credit and debit cards and our proprietary cash card as we offer new payment options to our members we may be subject to additional rules regulations compliance requirements and higher fraud losses for certain payment methods we pay interchange and other related card acceptance fees along with additional transaction processing fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services including the processing of credit and debit cards and our proprietary cash card and it could temporarily disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to payment card association rules and network operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change over time if we fail to comply with these rules or transaction processing requirements we may not be able to accept certain payment methods in addition if our internal systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for banks compromised card reissuance costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit andor debit card payments from our members and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we are subject to the risks of selling unsafe products which could result in illness or injury to our members harm our reputation and subject us to litigation 

if our merchandise offerings including food and prepared food products for human consumption drugs children  s products and pet products do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members   expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk the sale of these items involves the risk of healthrelated illness or injury to our members such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects substances chemicals other agents or residues introduced during the growing manufacturing storage handling and transportation phases our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards while we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness or injury in the future or that we will not be subject to claims lawsuits or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be long term 

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our members our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors our members are increasingly using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to shop online as part of our multichannel strategy we are making technology investments in our websites and recently launched a mobile application for mobile phones and other electronic devices if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant memberfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our inability to attract train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations merchandising and administrative personnel and the loss of any such persons could have a material adverse effect on our business other than an annual agreement with our ceo mr   jelinek we have no employment agreements with our officers we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified employees while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including regulatory changes prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we do not maintain key man insurance 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates margins earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase policies 

market and other external risks 

we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for members employees sites products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local regional and national wholesalers and retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries including other warehouse club operators supermarkets supercenter stores department and specialty stores gasoline stations and internetbased retailers such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise pricing selection and availability services location convenience and store hours the evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of members to comparison shop with digital tools which has enhanced competition our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results some competitors may have greater financial resources better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

higher energy costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs consumer debt levels foreign currency exchange rates unsettled financial markets weaknesses in housing and real estate markets reduced consumer confidence changes related to government fiscal and tax policies sovereign debt crises and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell prices of certain commodity products including gasoline and other food products are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations taxes and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins these factors could also increase our merchandise costs andor selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results general economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand our success depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including those relating to sustainability of product sources and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly we may have excess inventory which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance this could have an adverse effect on margins net sales less merchandise costs and operating income 

vendors may be unable to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner or may fail to adhere to our high standards resulting in adverse effects on our business merchandise inventories sales and profit margins 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices we have no assurances of continued supply pricing or access to new products and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us member demands may lead to outofstock positions of our merchandise leading to loss of sales and profits 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

we purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited particularly for certain food items the large volume we demand may not be consistently available 

our suppliers are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity inclement weather natural disasters supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise for these or other reasons one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control legal or regulatory standards these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members this failure could lead to litigation and recalls which could damage our reputation and our brands increase our costs and otherwise adversely impact our business 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes typhoons or earthquakes particularly in california or in washington state where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located could negatively affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots within the countries in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses public health issues whether occurring in the us or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or members or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels these events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations increased us and foreign government and agency regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs that could materially affect our profitability in addition climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience we also sell a substantial amount of gasoline the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which also could face increased regulation climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels extreme weather conditions increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured 

legal and regulatory risks 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

during 2013 our international operations including canada generated 28 of our consolidated net sales we plan to continue expanding our international operations as a result of these expansion activities in countries outside the us we expect that our international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many similar to those we face in the us but many of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions economic conditions regulatory constraints currency regulations and exchange rates and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the us and foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the us risks inherent in international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our future costs or on future profits and cash flows from our international operations 

item 1a—risk factors continued 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition impairment of longlived assets merchandise inventories vendor rebates and other vendor consideration selfinsurance liabilities income taxes unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 

provisions for losses related to selfinsured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 

we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate as the tax rates vary among countries a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision additionally any change in the enacted tax rates any adverse outcome in connection with any income tax audits in any jurisdiction including transfer pricing disputes or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

significant changes in or failure to comply with federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters any failure to comply with these laws could result in significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance remediation or compensatory requirements or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business requires compliance with a great variety of laws and regulations failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards fines and penalties we are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits including grand jury investigations government and agency investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation see discussion of legal proceedings in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item   8 of this report we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities the outcome of some of these legal proceedings audits unclaimed property laws and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management  s attention and resources

 item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share membership fee data and warehouse number data 

overview 

we believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is sales growth particularly comparable sales growth we define comparable warehouse sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year including remodels relocations and expansions as well as online sales comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing the frequency with which our members shop and the amounts that they spend on each visit sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control including fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions primarily impacting domestic operations the higher our comparable sales exclusive of currency fluctuations the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business especially the united states sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread including a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenter stores and department and specialty stores gasoline stations and internetbased retailers while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our private label items our philosophy is not to focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged but to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values this may cause us for example to absorb increases in merchandise costs at certain times rather than immediately passing them along to our members negatively impacting gross margin 

we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses and to a much lesser extent relocating existing warehouses to larger and betterlocated facilities as our warehouse base grows available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth however the negative aspects of such growth including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets are lessened our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to continue 

our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically some significant costs are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility expenses with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn rather we believe that achieving our longerterm objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business is operated on very low margins modest changes in various items in the income statement particularly gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses can have substantial impacts on net income 

our operating model is generally the same across our us canada and other international operating segments see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report certain countries in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth lower wages and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales andor less direct membership warehouse competition additionally we operate our lowermargin gasoline business only in the united states and canada   

in discussions of our consolidated operating results we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which are references to the differences between the foreignexchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars for financial reporting purposes this impact of foreignexchange rate changes is typically calculated as the difference between the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prioryear periods currency exchange rates 

our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to august 31 fiscal years 2013  and 2011 were 52week fiscal years ending on september 1 2013  and august 28 2011 respectively while fiscal year 2012  was a 53week fiscal year ending on september 2 2012 certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding unless otherwise noted references to net income relate to net income attributable to costco

2013 vs 2012 

net sales 

net sales increased 5808 or 6 during 2013 compared to 2012 this increase was attributable to a 6 increase in comparable warehouse sales and sales at warehouses opened in 2012 and 2013 partially offset by the impact of one additional week of sales in 2012 

changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately 208 or 21 basis points during 2013 the negative impact was primarily due to the japanese yen of approximately 354 partially offset by a positive impact of the mexican peso of approximately 127 changes in gasoline prices were immaterial to the change in net sales 

comparable sales 

comparable sales increased 6 during 2013 and were positively impacted by increases in both shopping frequency and the average amount spent by our members changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and gasoline prices were immaterial to the change in comparable sales the increase in comparable sales includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations 

2012 vs 2011 

net sales 

net sales increased 10014 or 12 during 2012 compared to 2011 this increase was attributable to a 7 increase in comparable warehouse sales sales at warehouses opened in 2011 and 2012 and the benefit of one additional week of sales in 2012 

gasoline price inflation positively impacted net sales by approximately 801 or 92 basis points which resulted from an 8 increase in the average sales price per gallon during 2012 changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately 597 or 69 basis points during 2012 primarily due to the canadian dollar the mexican peso and the korean won of approximately 310 255 and 57 respectively partially offset by a positive impact of the japanese yen of approximately 81

comparable sales increased 7 during 2012 and were positively impacted by increases in both shopping frequency and the average amount spent by our members gasoline price inflation positively impacted comparable sales results during 2012 while changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted comparable sales the increase in comparable sales includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations 

membership fees 



2013 vs 2012 

membership fees increased 10 in 2013 the increase was primarily due to raising our annual membership fees and membership signups at both existing and new warehouses these increases were partially offset by the impact of one additional week of membership fees in 2012 our member renewal rates are currently 90 in the us and canada and 86 on a worldwide basis 

we increased our annual membership fee in the us and canada effective november 1 2011 for new members and january 1 2012 for renewal members we increased our annual membership fee by 5 for us goldstar individual business business addon and canada business members to 55 also our us and canada executive membership annual fees increased from 100 to 110 we account for membership fee revenue net of estimated refunds on a deferred basis whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the oneyear membership period these fee increases had a positive impact on membership fee

revenues of approximately 119 and 37 in 2013 and 2012 respectively the remaining impact of this fee increase in 2014 will be immaterial 

2012 vs 2011 

membership fees increased 11 in 2012 the increase was due to new member signups at warehouses open for more than one year an extra week of membership fee revenue in fiscal 2012 the impact of raising our annual membership fees increased penetration of our higherfee executive membership program and additional member signups at new warehouses opened since the end of fiscal 2011 

gross margin 

  

2013 vs 2012 

gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased seven basis points compared to 2012 gross margin in our core merchandise categories food and sundries hardlines softlines and fresh foods when expressed as a percentage of net sales decreased four basis points primarily due to a decrease in fresh foods as a result of our continued investment in merchandise pricing warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margin when expressed as a percentage of net sales increased by six basis points predominately in our optical and hearing aid businesses additionally gross margin was positively impacted by five basis points due to a 27 lifo inventory benefit in 2013 compared to a charge of 21 in 2012 and two basis points due to a legal settlement the lifo benefit resulted from lower costs for our merchandise inventories primarily hardlines executive membership 2 reward program negatively impacted gross margin by two basis points due to increased spending by executive members 

gross margin for core merchandise categories when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales rather than total net sales decreased two basis points primarily due to a decrease in fresh foods 

gross margin on a geographic segment basis when expressed as a percentage of the segment’s own sales gross margin percentage increased in our us operation primarily due to improvements in warehouse ancillary and other businesses the lifo benefit and legal settlement also benefited our us operations these improvements were slightly offset by a decrease in fresh foods the gross margin percentage in our canadian operations was flat resulting from a decrease in fresh foods offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses the gross margin percentage in our other international segment decreased primarily in fresh foods 

2012 vs 2011 

gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 14 basis points compared to 2011 gross margin for core merchandise categories decreased 21 basis points primarily due to decreases in hardlines and food and sundries resulting from our investment in merchandise pricing excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales gross margin for core merchandise categories decreased 13 basis points the gross margin comparison was positively impacted by eight basis points due to a 21 lifo inventory charge in 2012 compared to an 87 lifo charge recorded in 2011 the lifo charge resulted from higher costs for our merchandise inventories primarily food and sundries and gasoline increased penetration of the executive membership 2 reward program negatively impacted gross margin by two basis points due to increased spending by executive members

selling general and administrative expenses 



2013 vs 2012 

sga expenses as a percent of net sales increased one basis point compared to 2012 this increase was driven by higher stock compensation expense of three basis points partially offset by contributions made to an initiative reforming alcohol beverage laws in washington state in the first quarter of 2012 with no comparable charge in 2013 which resulted in a positive impact of two basis points central operating costs as a percent of net sales were flat primarily due to the benefit of lower nonequity incentive compensation costs as a result of not meeting certain internal performance targets this was offset by higher central operating costs predominately related to the continued investment in the modernization of our information systems in our us operations warehouse operating costs as a percentage of net sales was flat primarily due to leveraging payroll costs in our us and canadian operations as a result of increased net sales which was offset by increases in other operating costs primarily employee benefits and workers compensation 

2012 vs 2011 

sga expenses as a percent of net sales improved 17 basis points compared to 2011 excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation sga expenses improved nine basis points primarily due to an eleven basis point improvement in our warehouse operating costs largely payroll this improvement was partially offset by contributions to an initiative reforming alcohol beverage laws in washington state and higher stock compensation expense which had negative impacts of two basis points each higher costs related to the modernization of our information systems and related activities which includes the replatforming of our ecommerce sites also adversely impacted our sga percentage 

preopening expenses 

  

preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings the timing of the opening relative to our yearend whether the warehouse is owned or leased and whether the opening is in an existing new or international market 

interest expense 

  

interest expense in 2013 primarily relates to our 1100 of 55 senior notes issued in fiscal 2007 and our 3500 of senior notes issued in december 2012 described in further detail under the heading “financing activities” and in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report the outstanding principal balance and associated interest on the 900 of 53 senior notes was paid in march 2012 resulting in a decrease in interest expense in 2012

interest income and other net 



2013 vs 2012 

the decrease in interest income in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to lower interest rates earned on our us cash balances there was a decrease in the positive impact of net foreigncurrency transaction gains resulting from the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and monetary liabilities during the year this was partially offset by a positive impact of marktomarket adjustments related to foreign exchange contracts entered into by our foreign subsidiaries as the us dollar was slightly stronger in certain international locations compared to 2012 see derivatives and foreign currency sections in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

2012 vs 2011 

the increase in interest income in 2012 compared to 2011 was attributable to higher cash balances and interest rates in our foreign subsidiaries the changes in foreigncurrency transaction gains and losses net in 2012 compared to 2011 were related to the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and monetary liabilities primarily our canadian subsidiary’s us dollardenominated payables 

provision for income taxes 

  

2013 vs 2012 

our provision for income taxes for 2013 was favorably impacted by nonrecurring net tax benefits of 77 primarily due to a 62 tax benefit recorded in the second quarter in connection with the special cash dividend paid to employees through our 401k retirement plan dividends paid on these shares are deductible for us income tax purposes 

2012 vs 2011 

our provision for income taxes for 2012 was adversely impacted by nonrecurring net tax expense of 25 relating primarily to the following items the adverse impact of an audit of costco mexico by the mexican tax authority the tax effects of a cash dividend declared by costco mexico and the tax effects of nondeductible expenses for our contribution to an initiative reforming alcohol beverage laws in washington state

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents 

  

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 6124 and 4854 at the end of 2013 and 2012 respectively of these balances approximately 1254 and 1161 at the end of 2013 and 2012 respectively represented debit and credit card receivables primarily related to sales in the last week of our fiscal year 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 3437 in 2013 compared to 3057 in 2012 our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees our cash flow used in operations generally consist of payments to our merchandise vendors warehouse operating costs including payroll and employee benefits utilities and credit card processing fees cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 2251 in 2013 compared to 1236 in 2012 our cash flow used in investing activities is primarily related to funding our warehouse expansion and remodeling activities we opened a total of 26 and 17 new warehouses in 2013 and 2012 respectively and plan to open 30 to 36 new warehouses in 2014 net cash used for purchases of shortterm investments in 2013 included the investment of the excess proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt described below 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 44 in 2013 compared to 2281 used in financing activities in 2012 our cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from the proceeds of the issuance of longterm debt largely the issuance of 3500 in aggregate principal amount of senior notes the majority of these proceeds were used to fund the special cash dividend additionally cash used for repurchases of our common stock was minimal in 2013 in 2012 cash used also included the repayment of longterm debt and purchase of the noncontrolling interest in costco mexico 

the effect of changes in foreignexchange rates decreased cash and cash equivalents by 114 in 2013 compared to 21 in 2012 this was predominately due to the weakening of the canadian dollar and japanese yen 

management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future we have not provided for us deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of certain nonus consolidated subsidiaries as we deem such earnings to be indefinitely reinvested we believe that our us current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our us liquidity requirements and we have no current plans to repatriate the cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by these subsidiaries for use in the us at september 1 2013 cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 2320 were held by these nonus consolidated subsidiaries 

dividends 

in april 2013 our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from 0275 to 031 per share additionally in november 2012 the board of directors declared a special cash dividend of 700 per share this dividend was paid in december 2012 in the amount of 3049 our cash dividends paid in 2013  totaled 817 per share as compared to 103 per share in 2012

contractual obligations 

as of september 1 2013  our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows 

  



 

 expansion plans 

our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land buildings and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses to a lesser extent capital is required for initial warehouse operations and working capital while there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review it is our current intention to spend approximately 2300 to 2500 during fiscal 2014 for real estate construction remodeling equipment for warehouses and related operations and the modernization of our information systems and related activities these expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

we plan to open 30 to 36 new warehouses in 2014 in 2013 we opened 26  new warehouses and spent a total of 2083  on capital expenditures 

bank credit facilities and commercial paper programs 

as of september 1 2013 we had total borrowing capacity within our bank credit facilities of 700 of which 381 was maintained by our international operations of the 381 maintained by our international operations 183 is guaranteed by the company we maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes there were 36 in outstanding shortterm borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2013 and none outstanding as of the end of 2012 the company has letter of credit facilities for commercial and standby letters of credit totaling 154 the outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2013 totaled 96 including 91 million in standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year all of the bank credit facilities have various expiration dates all within one year and generally we intend to renew these facilities prior to their expiration the amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding at that time 

financing activities 

in december 2012 we issued 3500 in aggregate principal amount of senior notes as follows 1200 of 065 senior notes due december 7 2015 1100 of 1125 senior notes due december 15 2017 and 1200 of 17 senior notes due december 15 2019 the proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes were used primarily to pay the special cash dividend

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements 

stock repurchase programs 

in april 2011 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program in the amount of 4000 expiring in april 2015 bringing total authorizations by our board of directors since inception of the program in 2001 to 10800 the authorization in april 2011 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling 792 

during 2013 and 2012 we repurchased 357000 and 7272000 shares of common stock at an average price of 9641 and 8475 totaling approximately 34 and 617 respectively the remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was 3055 at the end of 2013 purchases are made from timetotime as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under sec rule 10b51 repurchased shares are retired in accordance with the washington business corporation act 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and judgments we continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition investments merchandise inventory valuation impairment of longlived assets insuranceselfinsurance liabilities and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable for further information on key accounting policies see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition 

we generally recognize sales which include shipping fees where applicable net of estimated returns at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis 

we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when we are the primary obligor subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers influence product or service specifications or have several but not all of these indicators revenue and related shipping fees are recorded on a gross basis if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above we record the net amounts as commissions earned which is reflected in net sales 

we account for membership fee revenue net of estimated refunds on a deferred basis whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the oneyear membership period our executive members qualify for a 2 reward up to a maximum of approximately 750 per year which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses on qualified purchases made at costco warehouses we account for this reward as a reduction in sales the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of nonredemptions based on historical data 

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  amounts in millions except per share and share data membership fee data and warehouse number data continued 

investments 

investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment we employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry or issuer conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

merchandise inventories 

merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method and are stated using the lastin firstout lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the firstin firstout fifo method we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues we record an adjustment each quarter if necessary for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at yearend 

we provide for estimated inventory losses shrink between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year 

inventory cost where appropriate is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones terms of agreement or other systematic and rational approaches 

impairment of longlived assets 

we periodically evaluate our longlived assets for indicators of impairment such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their thencurrent fair market value 

insuranceselfinsurance liabilities 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including a whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance pool to provide for potential liabilities for workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors’ and officers’ liability vehicle liability and employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements we do not expect these accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity in future periods 




 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in millions 

our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents as defined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report as well as shortterm investments in government and agency securities and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields the majority of our shortterm investments are in fixed interest rate securities these securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations 

our board of directors have approved a policy that limits investments in the us to direct us government and government agency obligations repurchase agreements collateralized by us government and government agency obligations and us government and government agency money market funds our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary invests in us g overnment and government agency obligations corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgagebacked securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of aa 

our canadian and other international subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds bankers’ acceptances bank certificates of  deposit and term deposits generally denominated in their local currencies 

we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a 100 basispoint change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio at the end of 2013  and 2012  the incremental change in the fair market value was immaterial for those investments that are classified as availableforsale the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 

the nature and amount of our longterm debt may vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors as of the end of 2013 the majority of our longterm debt is fixed rate senior notes carried at 4595 fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixedrate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for more information on our longterm debt 

foreign currencyexchange risk 

our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in their nonfunctional currencies which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates we manage these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreignexchange contracts seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a nonfunctional foreigncurrency the contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the us dollar currently these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting we seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions these contracts do not contain any creditriskrelated contingent features 

we seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships there can be no assurance however that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk these contracts are limited to less than one year in duration see note 1 and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information on the fair value of open unsettled forward foreignexchange contracts at the end of 2013  and 2012  a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the functional currency compared to the nonfunctional currency exchange rates at september 1 2013  and september 2 2012  would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by 45 and 28 respectively 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume particularly electricity and natural gas which we seek to partially mitigate through fixedprice contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities primarily in the us and canada we also enter into variablepriced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis these contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no marktomarket adjustment

 item 1—business 

costco wholesale corporation and its subsidiaries costco or the company began operations in 1983 in seattle washington we are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the united states us and puerto rico canada the united kingdom mexico japan australia and through majorityowned subsidiaries in taiwan and korea our common stock trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “cost” 

historically our operations in mexico were through a 50 owned joint venture mexico on july 10 2012 we acquired the remaining 50 interest in mexico from our joint venture partner at the beginning of fiscal 2011 we began consolidating our mexico joint venture due to the adoption of a new accounting standard mexico’s results previously were accounted for under the equity method and our 50 share was included in “interest income and other net” in the consolidated statements of income in fiscal 2011 and 2012 mexico’s operations are fully consolidated and the joint venture partner’s 50 share through the acquisition date is included in “net income attributable to noncontrolling interest” in the consolidated statement of income after the acquisition date 100 of mexico’s operations are included in “net income attributable to costco” see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

we report on a 5253week fiscal year consisting of thirteen fourweek periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august the first three quarters consist of three periods each and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53week year the material seasonal impact in our operations is an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season references to 2012 relate to the 53week fiscal year ended september 2 2012 references to 2011 and 2010 relate to the 52week fiscal years ended august 28 2011 and august 29 2010 respectively 

general 

we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and select privatelabel products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover this turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers mass merchandisers supermarkets and supercenters 

we buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a crossdocking consolidation point depot or directly to our warehouses our depots receive containerbased shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses generally in less than twentyfour hours this process maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional multiplestep distribution channels such traditional steps include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers use of central receiving storing and distributing warehouses and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor 

because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover we generally sell inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors even though we take advantage of early payment discounts when available to the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital

our typical warehouse format averages approximately 143000 square feet newer units tend to be slightly larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices our warehouses are not elaborate facilities by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format we have limited inventory losses shrinkage to amounts well below those of typical discount retail operations 

marketing and promotional activities generally relate to new warehouse openings occasional direct mail to prospective new members and regular direct marketing programs such as the costco connection a magazine we publish for our members coupon mailers weekly emails from costcocom and costcoca and handouts to existing members promoting selected merchandise these practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical retailers 

our warehouses generally operate on a sevenday 69hour week open weekdays between 1000 am and 830 pm with earlier weekend closing hours gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers discount retailers and supermarkets and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking 

our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere we seek to limit specific items in each product line to fastselling models sizes and colors therefore we carry an average of approximately 3300 to 3800 active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business as opposed to a significantly higher number of skus at discount retailers supermarkets and supercenters many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise on certain electronic items we typically have a 90day return policy and provide free of charge technical support services as well as an extended warranty additional thirdparty warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic item purchases 

the following table indicates the approximate percentage of annual net sales accounted for by major category of items

ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently the following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal yearend 

 

  

 our online businesses at costcocom in the us and costcoca in canada provide our members additional products generally not found in our warehouses in addition to services such as digital photo processing pharmacy travel and membership services 

our warehouses accept cash checks certain debit cards american express and a private label costco credit card losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from making further purchases until restitution is made 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brandname merchandise we do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business we also purchase private label merchandise as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to brandname items 

certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

membership policy 

our membership format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue members can utilize their membership at any costco warehouse location in any country we have two primary types of members business and gold star individual our member renewal rate was approximately 897 in the us and canada and approximately 864 on a worldwide basis in 2012 consistent with recent years the renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or other evidence of business existence may become business members business members generally pay an annual membership fee of approximately 55 for the primary cardholder with addon membership cards available for an annual fee of approximately 55 each many of our business members also shop at costco for their personal needs gold star memberships are also available for an annual fee of approximately 55 to individuals who may not qualify for a business membership all paid memberships include a free household card

labor 

our employee count approximated 

 

  

 approximately 13700 hourly employees in certain of our locations in five states are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters all remaining employees are nonunion we consider our employee relations to be very good 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection warehouse location and member service we compete with over 800 warehouse club locations across 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

the us and canada primarily walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club and every major metropolitan area has multiple club operations in addition we compete with a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenter stores department and specialty stores gasoline stations and internetbased retailers competitors such as walmart target kohl’s and amazoncom are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors we also compete with lowcost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such as lowe’s home depot office depot petsmart staples kroger trader joe’s whole foods cvs walgreens and best buy our international operations face similar types of competitors 

regulation 

certain state laws require that we apply minimum markups to our selling prices for specific goods such as tobacco products alcoholic beverages and gasoline while compliance with such laws may cause us to charge higher prices other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions and we believe that compliance with such laws currently in effect do not have a material adverse effect on our operations 

intellectual property 

we believe that to varying degrees our trademarks trade names copyrights proprietary processes trade secrets patents trade dress domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important factors in our success we have invested significantly in the development and protection of our wellrecognized brands including the costco wholesale ® series of trademarks and our private label brand kirkland signature ®  we believe that kirkland signature products are premium products offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for national brand products and that they help lower costs differentiate our merchandise offerings from other retailers and generally earn higher margins we expect to increase the sales penetration of our private label items in the future 

we rely on trademark and copyright laws trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements with our suppliers employees and others to protect our proprietary rights the availability and duration of trademark registrations vary from country to country however trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained

 item 1a—risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks are not the only risks that we face we could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial you should review these risk factors carefully in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this report 

we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for members employees sites products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local regional and national wholesalers and retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries including other warehouse club operators supermarkets supercenter stores department and specialty stores gasoline stations and internetbased retailers such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise pricing selection and availability services location convenience and store hours our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results some competitors may have greater financial resources better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

higher energy costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs consumer debt levels foreign currency exchange rates unsettled financial markets weaknesses in housing and real estate markets reduced consumer confidence changes related to government fiscal and tax policies sovereign debt crises and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell prices of certain commodity products including gasoline and other food products are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations taxes and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins these factors could also increase our merchandise costs andor selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results general economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our us and canadian operations 

our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our us and canadian operations which comprised 88 and 83 of consolidated net sales and operating income in 2012 respectively within the us we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 24 of consolidated net sales in 2012 our california market in general has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other markets any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our us operations particularly in california and our canadian operations could arise from among other things failing to meet targets for warehouse openings declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor healthcare and energy costs cannibalizing existing locations with 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values and failing to consistently provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members 

we may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy including expanding our business both in existing markets and in new markets which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of constructing leasing and operating our warehouses we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms in addition certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us within their jurisdictions failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively may affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses which could have a material adverse affect on our future growth and profitability 

we seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses 

we also intend to open warehouses in new markets the risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us attracting members of other wholesale club operators currently operating in the new market our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence in new markets we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed and as a result our future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand our success depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including those relating to sustainability of product sources and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly we may have excess inventory which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance this could have an adverse effect on margins net sales less merchandise costs and operating income 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations 

membership loyalty is essential to our business model damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales lower employee morale and productivity diminish member trust and reduce member renewal rates and accordingly membership fee revenues resulting in a reduction in shareholder value 

in addition we sell many products under our owned and exclusive kirkland signature brand maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of our kirkland signature products for our customers is essential to developing and maintaining customer loyalty these products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales if the kirkland signature brand experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected 

vendors may be unable to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner or may fail to adhere to our high standards resulting in adverse affects on our business merchandise inventories sales and profit margins 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices we have no assurances of continued supply pricing or access to new products and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us member demands may lead to outofstock positions of our merchandise leading to loss of sales and profits 

we purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited particularly for certain food items the large volume we demand may not be consistently available 

our suppliers are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity inclement weather natural disasters supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise for these or other reasons one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control legal or regulatory standards these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members this failure could lead to litigation and recalls which could damage our reputation and our brands increase our costs and otherwise adversely impact our business 

disruptions in our depot operations could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction 

we depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process primarily through our depots although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires hurricanes earthquakes or other catastrophic events labor shortages or shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

natural disasters or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes typhoons or earthquakes particularly in california or in washington state where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located could negatively affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots within the countries in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses public health issues such as a potential h1n1 flu swine flu pandemic whether occurring in the us or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or members or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels these events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations increased us and foreign government and agency regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs that could materially affect our profitability in addition climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience we also sell a substantial amount of gasoline the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which also could face increased regulation climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels extreme weather conditions increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

during 2012 our international operations including canada generated 28 of our consolidated net sales we plan to continue expanding our international operations as a result of these expansion activities in countries outside the us we expect that our international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many similar to those we face in the us but many of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions economic conditions regulatory constraints currency regulations and exchange rates and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the us and foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the us risks inherent in international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our future costs or on future profits and cash flows from our international operations 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition sales returns reserves impairment of longlived assets inventories vendor rebates and other vendor consideration selfinsurance liabilities income taxes unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 

provisions for losses related to selfinsured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 were enacted this legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured we expect our healthcare costs to increase though not materially as a result of this legislation similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

unfavorable changes in tax rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate as the tax rates vary among countries a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision additionally any change in the enacted tax rates any adverse outcome in connection with any income tax audits in any jurisdiction including transfer pricing disputes or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 

significant changes in or failure to comply with federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters any failure to comply with these laws could result in significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance remediation or compensatory requirements or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business requires compliance with a great variety of laws and regulations failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards fines and penalties we are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits including grand jury investigations government and agency investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation see discussion of legal proceedings in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities the outcome of some of these legal proceedings audits unclaimed property laws and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources 

we are subject to the risks of selling unsafe products which could result in illness or injury to our members harm our reputation and subject us to litigation 

if our merchandise offerings including food and prepared food products for human consumption drugs childrens’ products and pet products do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members’ expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk the sale of these items involves the risk of healthrelated illness or injury to our members such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects substances chemicals other agents or residues introduced during the growing manufacturing storage handling and transportation phases our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards while we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness or injury in the future or that we will not be subject to claims lawsuits or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be long term 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of memberrelated and business information we could damage our reputation with members incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

we receive retain and transmit certain personal information about our members in addition our online operations at wwwcostcocom and wwwcostcoca depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems or those of our business partners that results in our members’ personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

additionally the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the international federal and state levels privacy and information security laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach our reputation could be damaged possibly resulting in lost future business and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of noncompliance 

our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business failure to adequately update our systems and disruptions in both our primary and backup systems could harm our ability to run our business and adversely affect our results of operations 

although we believe that we have independent redundant primary and secondary computer systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes and errors by our employees if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we expect to make significant technology investments in the coming years which are key to managing our business we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from the technology targeting the wrong opportunities failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations additionally the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost

if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our members our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors our members are increasingly using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to shop online as part of our multichannel strategy we are making technology investments in our websites and recently launched a mobile application for mobile phones and other electronic devices if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant memberfacing technology in a timely manner our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition if our online businesses or our other memberfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of member confidence data security breaches lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

our inability to attract train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations merchandising and administrative personnel and the loss of any such persons could have a material adverse effect on our business other than an annual agreement with our ceo mr jelinek we have no employment agreements with our officers we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified employees while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we do not maintain key man insurance 

failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 

we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates margins earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase policies

overview 

we believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is sales growth particularly comparable sales growth we report comparable sales as sales in warehouses open for at least one year including relocations remodels and expansions comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing the frequency with which our members shop and the amounts that they spend on each visit sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control including fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions primarily impacting domestic operations the higher our comparable sales exclusive of currency fluctuations the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business especially the united states sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread including a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenter stores and department and specialty stores gasoline stations and internetbased retailers while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our private label items our philosophy is not to focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged but to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority”—consistently providing the most competitive values this may cause us for example to absorb increases in merchandise costs at certain times rather than immediately passing them along to our members negatively impacting gross margin 

we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses and relocating existing warehouses to larger and betterlocated facilities as our warehouse base grows available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth however the negative aspects of such growth including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets are lessened our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to continue 

our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically some significant costs are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility expenses with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn rather we believe that achieving our longerterm objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business is operated on very low margins modest changes in various items in the income statement particularly gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses can have substantial impacts on net income 

our operating model is generally the same across our us canada and other international segments see item 8 note 12 of this report certain countries in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth lower wage and benefits as a percentage of country sales andor less direct membership warehouse competition additionally we operate our lowermargin gasoline business only in the united states and canada 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share membership fee data and warehouse number data continued 

  

in discussions of our consolidated operating results we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which are references to the differences between the foreignexchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars for financial reporting purposes this impact of foreignexchange rate changes is typically calculated as the difference between the current year currency exchange rates and the comparable prioryear currency exchange rates 

our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to august 31 fiscal 2012 is a 53week year ending on september 2 2012 while fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were 52week periods certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding unless otherwise noted references to net income relate to net income attributable to costco

net sales 

 

  

  

  

 2012 vs 2011 

net sales 

net sales increased 10014 or 115 during 2012 compared to 2011 this increase was attributable to a 7 increase in comparable warehouse sales sales at warehouses opened in 2011 and 2012 to the extent that they have been excluded from comparable warehouse sales and the benefit of one additional week of sales in 2012 

gasoline price inflation positively impacted net sales by approximately 801 or 92 basis points which resulted from an 8 increase in the average sales price per gallon during 2012 changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately 597 or 69 basis points during 2012 the negative impact in 2012 was primarily due to negative impacts of the canadian dollar the mexican peso and the korean won of approximately 310 255 and 57 respectively partially offset by a positive impact of the japanese yen of approximately 81 

comparable sales 

comparable sales increased 7 during 2012 and were positively impacted by increases in both shopping frequency and the average amount spent by our members gasoline price inflation positively impacted comparable sales results during 2012 while changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted comparable sales the increase in comparable sales includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations

2011 vs 2010 

net sales 

net sales increased 10793 or 142 during 2011 compared to 2010 excluding sales of mexico not consolidated in 2010 the increase would have been 11 this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in comparable warehouse sales and the remainder primarily from sales at the 20 net new warehouses opened during 2011 

gasoline price inflation positively impacted net sales by approximately 1699 or 223 basis points which resulted from a 24 increase in the average sales price per gallon during 2011 changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately 1308 or 172 basis points during 2011 the positive impact in 2011 was primarily due to positive impacts in the exchange rates of the canadian dollar the japanese yen and the mexican peso of approximately 728 157 and 152 respectively 

comparable sales 

comparable sales including mexico for both 2011 and 2010 increased 10 during 2011 and were positively impacted by increases in the average amount spent by our members and in their shopping frequency gasoline price inflation and changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar positively impacted comparable sales results in 2011 the increase in comparable sales includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations 

membership fees 

 

 2012 vs 2011 

membership fees increased 111 in 2012 the increase was due to new member signups at warehouses open for more than one year an extra week of membership fee revenue in fiscal 2012 the impact of raising our annual membership fees increased penetration of our higherfee executive membership program and additional member signups at new warehouses opened since the end of fiscal 2011 our member renewal rates are consistent with recent years currently 897 in the us and canada and 864 on a worldwide basis 

as previously reported effective november 1 2011 for new members and january 1 2012 for renewal members we increased our annual membership fee by 5 for us goldstar individual business business addon and canada business members to 55 also our us and canada executive membership annual fees increased from 100 to 110 and the maximum 2 reward associated with executive membership increased from 500 to 750 annually we account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the oneyear membership period these fee increases had a positive impact on membership fee revenues during 2012 of approximately 37 and will continue to have an impact in the next several quarters we expect this increase to positively impact membership fee revenue by approximately 121 in fiscal 2013 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share membership fee data and warehouse number data continued 

  

changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted membership fees in 2012 by approximately 10 

2011 vs 2010 

membership fees increased 104 in 2011 compared to 2010 excluding membership fees from mexico not consolidated in 2010 the increase would have been 83 in 2011 this increase was due to the higher penetration of our higherfee executive membership program and the additional membership signups at the 20 net new warehouses opened during 2011 

changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar positively impacted membership fees by approximately 30 in 2011 primarily due to the positive impacts of the canadian dollar of 17 

gross margin 

 

 2012 vs 2011 

gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 14 basis points compared to 2011 gross margin for core merchandise categories food and sundries hardlines softlines and fresh foods decreased 21 basis points primarily due to decreases in hardlines and food and sundries resulting from our investment in merchandise pricing excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales gross margin for core merchandise categories decreased 13 basis points the gross margin comparison was positively impacted by eight basis points due to a 21 lifo inventory charge in 2012 compared to an 87 lifo charge recorded in 2011 the lifo charge resulted from higher costs for our merchandise inventories primarily food and sundries and gasoline increased penetration of the executive membership 2 reward program negatively impacted gross margin by two basis points due to increased spending by executive members changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 64 in 2012 primarily due to the negative impacts of the canadian dollar and mexican peso of approximately 33 and 29 respectively 

2011 vs 2010 

gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 14 basis points compared to 2010 gross margin for core merchandise categories when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales rather than total net sales increased 18 basis points primarily due to hardlines and food and sundries however when the core merchandise gross margin is expressed as a percentage of total net sales it decreased two basis points from the prior year due primarily to the increased sales penetration of the lowermargin gasoline business warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margins decreased by two basis points as a percent of total net sales the gross margin comparison was also negatively impacted by 87 or 10 basis points due to a lifo inventory charge recorded in 2011 the charge resulted from higher costs for our merchandise inventories primarily food and sundries and gasoline there was no lifo inventory charge recorded in 2010 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share membership fee data and warehouse number data continued 

  

excluding the impact of consolidating mexico the gross margin comparison as a percent of net sales would have been a decrease of 18 basis points during 2011 changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar positively impacted gross margin by approximately 149 in 2011 primarily due to the positive impacts of the canadian dollar mexican peso and japanese yen of approximately 84 18 and 18 respectively 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 2012 vs 2011 

sga expenses as a percent of net sales improved 17 basis points compared to 2011 excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation sga expenses improved nine basis points primarily due to an eleven basis point improvement in our warehouse operating costs largely payroll this improvement was partially offset by contributions to an initiative reforming alcohol beverage laws in washington state and higher stock compensation expense which had negative impacts of two basis points each higher costs related to the modernization of our information systems and related activities which includes the replatforming of our ecommerce sites also adversely impacted our sga percentage changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar positively impacted sga expenses by approximately 45 in 2012 primarily due to the positive impacts of the canadian dollar and mexican peso by approximately 27 and 18 respectively 

2011 vs 2010 

sga expenses as a percent of net sales improved 31 basis points in 2011 compared to 2010 excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation sga expenses improved 11 basis points primarily due to a 15 basis point improvement in our warehouse operating costs largely payroll this improvement was partially offset by a nonrecurring benefit of 24 or three basis points recorded in fiscal 2010 related to the refund of a previously recorded canadian employee tax liability 

the consolidation of mexico which compared to our other operating segments has lower sga expenses as a percent of its own net sales favorably impacted sga expenses as a percent of net sales by seven basis points in 2011 changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar negatively impacted sga expenses by approximately 116 in 2011 primarily due to the negative impacts of the canadian dollar japanese yen and mexican peso by approximately 65 16 and 12 respectively 

preopening expenses 

 

 preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings the timing of the opening relative to our yearend whether the warehouse is owned or leased and whether the opening is in an existing new or international market 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share membership fee data and warehouse number data continued 

  

interest expense 

 

 interest expense primarily relates to our 900 of 53 and 1100 of 55 senior notes issued in fiscal 2007 described in further detail under the heading “financing activities” below and in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report the outstanding principal balance and associated interest on the 53 senior notes was paid on march 15 2012 resulting in a decrease in interest expense in 2012 this debt was paid with existing sources of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

interest income and other net 

 

 2012 vs 2011 

the increase in interest income in 2012 compared to 2011 was attributable to higher cash balances and interest rates in our foreign subsidiaries the changes in foreigncurrency transaction gains and losses net in 2012 compared to 2011 were related to the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and monetary liabilities primarily our canadian subsidiary’s us dollardenominated payables see derivatives and foreign currency sections in item 8 note 1 of this report 

2011 vs 2010 

the increase in interest income in 2011 compared to 2010 was attributable to increases in our cash and cash equivalents including shortterm investments slightly higher interest rates and the consolidation of our mexico operations see the section titled “derivatives” in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report in addition the decrease in earnings of affiliates and other net is primarily due to the previously discussed change in the accounting treatment of mexico see further discussion in note 1 included in item 8 of this report 

provision for income taxes 

 

 our provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2012 was adversely impacted by nonrecurring net tax expense of 25 relating primarily to the following items the adverse impact of an audit of costco mexico by the mexican tax authority the tax effects of a cash dividend declared by costco mexico and the tax effects of nondeductible expenses for our contribution to an initiative reforming alcohol beverage laws in washington state

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

the following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets 

 

 our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances of these balances approximately 1161 and 982 at the end of 2012 and 2011 respectively represented debit and credit card receivables primarily related to sales within the last week of our fiscal year 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 3057 in 2012 compared to 3198 in 2011 a decrease of 141 this decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in our net investment in merchandise inventories change in merchandise inventories less changes in accounts payable of 314 an 87 decrease in deferred income taxes and a 38 decrease in other current operating assets and liabilities these items were partially offset by a 225 increase in net income including noncontrolling interests a 53 increase in depreciation and amortization and a 34 increase in stockbased compensation 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1236 in 2012 compared to 1180 in 2011 an increase of 56 this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of 190 used for property and equipment additions in 2012 as compared to 2011 additionally in 2011 cash increased by 165 resulting from the initial consolidation of costco mexico these items were partially offset by net cash provided by purchases maturities and sales of investments of 255 in 2012 compared to net cash used by these activities of 60 in 2011 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 2281 in 2012 compared to 1277 in 2011 an increase of 1004 this increase was primarily attributable to the 900 repayment of our 53 senior notes 2012 notes and 789 used to purchase the noncontrolling interest in costco mexico from our joint venture partner in addition proceeds from the exercise of stock options decreased 176 and our mexico subsidiary made a distribution to our former joint venture partner of 161 these items were partially offset by an increase in bank checks outstanding of 971 in 2012 the increase in bank checks outstanding was due to maintaining lower balances in banks on which our checks are drawn 

the effect of changes in foreignexchange rates decreased cash and cash equivalents by 21 in 2012 compared to an increase of 54 in 2011 a decrease of 75 

management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future we have not provided for us deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of 3162 and 2646 at the end of 2012 and 2011 respectively of certain nonus consolidated subsidiaries as such earnings are deemed by us to be indefinitely reinvested we believe that our us current asset position is sufficient to meet our us liquidity requirements and have no current plans to repatriate for use in the us the cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by these subsidiaries at september 2 2012 cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 2039 were held by these nonus consolidated subsidiaries

 expansion plans 

our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land buildings and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses to a lesser extent capital is required for initial warehouse operations and working capital while there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review it is our current intention to spend approximately 1800 to 2000 during fiscal 2013 for real estate construction remodeling equipment for warehouses and related operations and the modernization of our information systems and related activities these expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

we plan to open 27 to 30 net new warehouses in 2013 

we opened 16 net new warehouses in 2012 including the reopening of our tamasakai japan warehouse damaged in the march 2011 japan earthquake and the relocation of our ancaster ontario warehouse to a larger and betterlocated facility we spent a total of 1480 on capital expenditures in 2012

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and judgments we continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition investments merchandise inventory valuation impairment of longlived assets insuranceselfinsurance liabilities and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable for further information on key accounting policies see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition 

we generally recognize sales which include shipping fees where applicable net of estimated returns at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis 

we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when we are the primary obligor subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers influence product or service specifications or have several but not all of these indicators revenue and related shipping fees are 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share membership fee data and warehouse number data continued 

  

recorded on a gross basis if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above we record the net amounts as commissions earned which is reflected in net sales 

membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members we account for membership fee revenue net of estimated refunds on a deferred basis whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the oneyear membership period 

our executive members qualify for a 2 reward which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses up to a maximum of approximately 750 per year on qualified purchases made at costco we account for this 2 reward as a reduction in sales the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of nonredemptions based on historical data 

investments 

investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment we employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry or issuer conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

merchandise inventories 

merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method and are stated using the lastin firstout lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the firstin firstout fifo method we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues we record an adjustment each quarter if necessary for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at yearend 

we provide for estimated inventory losses shrink between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year 

inventory cost where appropriate is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones terms of agreement or other systematic and rational approaches 

impairment of longlived assets 

we periodically evaluate our longlived assets for indicators of impairment such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their thencurrent fair market value 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share membership fee data and warehouse number data continued 

  

insuranceselfinsurance liabilities 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including a whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance pool to provide for potential liabilities for workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors’ and officers’ liability vehicle liability and employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements we do not expect these recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity in future periods 




 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds us government and agency securities federal deposit insurance corporation insured corporate bonds and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields the majority of our shortterm investments are in fixed interest rate securities these securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations our board of directors have approved a policy that limits investments in the us to direct us government and government agency obligations repurchase agreements collateralized by us government and government agency obligations and us government and government agency money market funds 

the investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary invests in us government and government agency obligations corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage

backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of aa all of our foreign subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds investment grade securities bankers’ acceptances bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies additionally our canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in us dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current us dollar obligations 

we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact an assumed 100 basis point change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio at the end of 2012 and 2011 the incremental change in the fair market value was immaterial for those investments that are classified as availableforsale the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 

the nature and amount of our longterm debt may vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors as of the end of 2012 the majority of our fixedrate longterm debt included 1100 of 55 senior notes carried at 1097 fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixedrate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for more information on our longterm debt

our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in their nonfunctional currencies which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates we manage these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreignexchange contracts seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a nonfunctional foreigncurrency the contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the us dollar currently these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting we seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions these contracts do not contain any creditriskrelated contingent features 

we seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships there can be no assurance however that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk these contracts are limited to less than one year in duration see note 1 and note 3 in item 8 of this report for additional information on the fair value of open unsettled forward foreignexchange contracts at the end of 2012 and 2011 a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the functional currency compared to the nonfunctional currency exchange rates at september 2 2012 and august 28 2011 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by 28 and 25 respectively 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume particularly electricity and natural gas which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixedprice contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities primarily in the us and canada we also enter into variablepriced contracts for some purchases of natural gas in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis these contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no marktomarket adjustment

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 2 2012 using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework based on its assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 2 2012 the attestation of kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is included with the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report

 item 1—business 

costco wholesale corporation and its subsidiaries costco or the company began operations in 1983 in seattle washington in october 1993 we merged with the price company which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept to form pricecostco inc a delaware corporation in january 1997 after the spinoff of most of our nonwarehouse assets to price enterprises inc we changed our name to costco companies inc on august 30 1999 we reincorporated from delaware to washington and changed our name to costco wholesale corporation our common stock trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “cost” 

we report on a 5253week fiscal year consisting of thirteen fourweek periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august the first three quarters consist of three periods each and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53week year the material seasonal impact in our operations is an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season references to 2011 2010 and 2009 relate to the 52week fiscal years ended august 28 2011 august 29 2010 and august 30 2009 respectively 

the company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the united states canada the united kingdom japan australia through majorityowned subsidiaries in taiwan and korea and a 50 owned joint venture in mexico mexico at the beginning of fiscal 2011 we began consolidating our mexico joint venture due to the adoption of a new accounting standard mexico’s results previously were accounted for under the equity method and our 50 share was included in “interest income and other net” in the consolidated statements of income in the current year the financial position and results of mexico’s operations are fully consolidated and the joint venture partner’s 50 share is included in “net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” in the consolidated statements of income the initial consolidation of mexico increased total assets liabilities and revenue by approximately 3 with no impact on net income or net income per common share attributable to costco see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

general 

we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and privatelabel products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover this turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers mass merchandisers supermarkets and supercenters 

we buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a crossdocking consolidation point depot or directly to our warehouses our depots receive containerbased shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses generally in less than twentyfour hours this maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional multiplestep distribution channels such traditional steps include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers use of central receiving storing and distributing warehouses and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor 

because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover we generally sell inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors even though we take advantage of early payment discounts when available to the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

our typical warehouse format averages approximately 143000 square feet newer units tend to be slightly larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices our warehouses need not have elaborate facilities by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format we have limited inventory losses shrinkage to less than twotenths of one percent of net sales in the last several fiscal years—well below those of typical discount retail operations 

we generally limit marketing and promotional activities to new warehouse openings occasional direct mail to prospective new members and regular direct marketing programs such as the costco connection a magazine we publish for our members coupon mailers weekly email blasts from costcocom and handouts to existing members promoting selected merchandise these practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical retailers 

our warehouses generally operate on a sevenday 69hour week open weekdays between 1000 am and 830 pm with earlier weekend closing hours gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers discount retailers and supermarkets and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking 

our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere we seek to limit specific items in each product line to fastselling models sizes and colors therefore we carry an average of approximately 3600 active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business as opposed to 45000 to 140000 skus or more at discount retailers supermarkets and supercenters many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise on certain electronic items we generally have a 90day return policy and provide free of charge technical support services as well as an extended warranty 

only the 2011 data in the accompanying tables includes mexico 

the following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by major category of items

ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently the following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal yearend 

 

 the 2010 and 2009 numbers exclude the 32 warehouses operated in mexico 

our electronic commerce businesses costcocom in the us and costcoca in canada provide our members additional products generally not found in our warehouses in addition to services such as digital photo processing pharmacy travel and membership services 

our warehouses accept cash checks certain debit cards american express and a private label costco credit card losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from making further purchases until restitution is made 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brandname merchandise we do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business we also purchase private label merchandise as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to name brand items 

certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

membership policy 

our membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue members can utilize their memberships at any costco warehouse location in any country we have two primary types of members business and gold star individual our member renewal rate was 89 in the us and canada and approximately 86 on a worldwide basis consistent with recent years the renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or other evidence of business existence may become business members business members generally pay an annual membership fee of approximately 50 for the primary and household membership card with addon membership cards available for an annual fee of approximately 50 including a free household card many of our business members also shop at costco for their personal needs individual gold star memberships are available to individuals who do not qualify for a business membership for an annual fee of approximately 50 which includes a household card 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

our membership was made up of the following in thousands 

 

 the numbers for 2010 and 2009 exclude approximately 2900 and 2800 cardholders of mexico at the end of those years 

executive membership is available to all members with the exception of business addon members in the us canada mexico and the united kingdom for an annual fee of approximately 100 this program excluding mexico offers additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services such as merchant creditcard processing auto and home insurance the costco auto purchase program check printing services and a high yield savings program the services are generally provided by thirdparties and vary by country and state in addition executive members qualify for a 2 annual reward which can be redeemed at costco warehouses up to a maximum of approximately 500 per year on qualified purchases made at costco at the end of 2011 2010 and 2009 executive members represented 38 36 and 33 respectively of our primary membership executive members generally spend more than other members and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase 

labor 

our employee count approximated 

 

 the numbers for 2010 and 2009 exclude approximately 9000 individuals who were employed by mexico at the end of those years approximately 13600 hourly employees in certain of our locations all former price company locations in five states are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters all remaining employees are nonunion we consider our employee relations to be very good 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection warehouse location and member service we compete with over 800 warehouse club locations across the us and canada walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club and every major metropolitan area has multiple club operations in addition we compete with a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenter stores department and specialty stores gasoline stations and internetbased retailers competitors such as walmart target kohl’s and amazoncom are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors we also compete with lowcost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such as lowe’s home depot office depot petsmart staples trader joe’s whole foods best buy and barnes  noble our international operations face similar types of competitors 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

regulation 

certain state laws require that we apply minimum markups to our selling prices for specific goods such as tobacco products alcoholic beverages and gasoline while compliance with such laws may cause us to charge higher prices other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions and we believe that compliance with such laws currently in effect do not have a material adverse effect on our operations 

certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us within their jurisdictions if enacted such laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our operations 

intellectual property 

we believe that to varying degrees our trademarks trade names copyrights proprietary processes trade secrets patents trade dress and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important factors in our success our failure to continue to develop maintain and protect these properties would adversely affect our business and financial results we have invested significantly in the development and protection of our wellrecognized brands including the costco wholesale ® series of trademarks and our private label brand kirkland signature ®  we believe that kirkland signature products are premium products offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for national brand products and that they help lower costs differentiate our merchandise offerings from other retailers and generally earn higher margins we expect to increase the sales penetration of our private label items in the future we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate

 item 1a—risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks are not the only risks that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the united states and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial 

we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators which could negatively affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for members employees sites products and services and in other important respects with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries we compete with a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenter stores department and specialty stores gasoline stations and internetbased retailers such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise pricing selection and availability services location convenience and store hours our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could negatively affect our financial performance some competitors may have greater financial resources better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance 

higher interest rates energy costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs consumer debt levels unsettled financial markets weaknesses in housing and real estate markets reduced consumer confidence changes related to government fiscal and tax policies and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell prices of certain commodity products including gasoline and other food products are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins these factors can also increase our merchandise costs andor selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results general economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events 

our growth strategy includes expanding our business both in existing markets and in new markets 

our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of constructing leasing and operating our warehouses we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively will affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses which may have a material adverse affect on our future growth and profitability 

  

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

we seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses 

we also intend to open warehouses in new markets the risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us attracting members of other wholesale club operators currently operating in the new market our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence in new markets we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed as a result our future profitability may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our united states and canada operations 

our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our united states and canada operations which comprised 89 and 83 of consolidated net sales and operating income in 2011 respectively within the united states we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 24 of consolidated net sales in 2011 our california market in general has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other markets any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our united states operations particularly in california and our canada operations could arise from among other things failing to meet targets for warehouse openings declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor healthcare and energy costs cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values and failing to consistently provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members 

we depend on vendors to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices we have no assurances of continued supply pricing or access to new products and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us member demands may lead to outofstock positions of our merchandise leading to loss of sales and profits 

we purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited particularly for certain food items the large volume we demand may not be consistently available 

our suppliers are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity inclement weather natural disasters supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise for these or other reasons one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control legal or regulatory stan 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

dards these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members this failure could lead to litigation and recalls which could damage our reputation and our brands increase our costs and otherwise hurt our business 

disruptions in our depot operations could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction 

we depend on the orderly operation of the receiving and distribution process primarily through our depots although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires hurricanes earthquakes or other catastrophic events labor shortages and disagreements or shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand our success depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including those relating to sustainability of product sources and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly we may have excess inventory which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance this could have an adverse effect on margins and operating income 

our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our financial results 

membership loyalty is essential to our business model damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales lower employee morale and productivity diminish member trust and reduce member renewal rates and accordingly membership fee revenues resulting in a reduction in shareholder value 

in addition we sell many products under our owned and exclusive kirkland signature brand maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of our kirkland signature products for our customers is essential to developing and maintaining customer loyalty these products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales if the kirkland signature brand experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition sales returns reserves impairment of longlived assets and warehouse closing costs inventories vendor rebates and other consideration selfinsurance liabilities income taxes unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance provisions for losses related to selfinsured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 were enacted this legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured we expect our healthcare costs to increase but not materially as a result of this legislation similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

unfavorable changes in tax rates could adversely affect our operations financial conditions or cash flows 

we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate as the tax rates vary among countries a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision additionally any change in the enacted tax rates any adverse outcome in connection with any income tax audits in any jurisdiction including transfer pricing disputes or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

failure of our internal control over financial reporting could make our financial results inaccurate or untimely 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements providing reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to and cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and backup systems could harm our business 

although we believe that we have independent redundant and primary and secondary computer systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is important that we maintain 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes and errors by our employees if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in our computer systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we expect to make significant technology investments in the coming years which are key to managing our business we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from the technology targeting the wrong opportunities failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs may result in the loss of our competitive position or underlying financial data additionally the costs potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or provide them in a delayed or more costly manner 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our financial performance 

during 2011 our international operations including canada generated 27 of our consolidated net sales we plan to continue expanding our international operations as a result of these expansion activities in countries outside the united states we expect that our international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many beyond our control and similar to those we face in the united states these factors include political conditions economic conditions regulatory constraints currency regulations and exchange rates and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries laws and regulations of foreign governments and the united states such as the foreign corrupt practices act agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the united states risks inherent in international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an adverse impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations 

market expectations for our financial performance is high 

we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates margins earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase policies 

  

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

natural disasters or other catastrophic events could unfavorably affect our financial performance 

natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes particularly in california or in washington state where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located could unfavorably affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas delays in the delivery of goods to our depots or warehouses within a country in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses public health issues such as a potential h1n1 flu swine flu pandemic whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers 

factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability in addition climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience we also sell a substantial amount of gasoline the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which also could face increased regulation climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornados and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels extreme weather conditions increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters

 item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data 

overview 

we believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is sales growth particularly comparable sales growth sales in warehouses open for at least one year comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing the frequency with which our members shop and the amounts they spend on each visit sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control including fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions primarily impacting domestic operations the higher our comparable sales the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business especially the united states sales growth and our gross margin are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread including a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers including supermarkets supercenter stores department and specialty stores gasoline stations and internetbased retailers while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our private label items our philosophy is not to focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged but to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority”—consistently providing the most competitive values this may cause us for example to absorb increases in merchandise costs at certain times rather than immediately passing them along to our members negatively impacting gross margin 

we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses and relocating existing warehouses to larger and betterlocated facilities as our warehouse base grows available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth however the negative aspects of such growth including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets are ameliorated our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to continue 

our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically some significant costs are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility expenses with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn rather we believe that achieving our longerterm objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business is operated on low margins modest changes in various items in the income statement particularly gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses can have substantial impacts on net income

 2011 vs 2010 

net sales 

net sales increased 10793 or 142 during 2011 compared to 2010 excluding sales of mexico the increase would have been 11 this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in comparable warehouse sales and the remainder primarily from sales at the 20 net new warehouses opened during 2011 24 opened and four closed two due to relocation and two temporarily closed for repairs due to damage caused by the march 11 2011 japan earthquake one of which remained closed as of the end of 2011 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar which positively impacted net sales during 2011 by approximately 1308 or 172 basis points net sales were also positively impacted by gasoline price increases during 2011 by approximately 1699 or 223 basis points which resulted from a 24 increase in the average sales price per gallon 

our sales results continued to be impacted albeit to a lesser extent than in 2010 by general economic conditions and those conditions may continue to have an adverse impact on spending by our members we believe however that due to the nature of our business model we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment 

comparable sales 

comparable sales including mexico for both this year and last year increased 10 during 2011 and were positively impacted by increases in the average amount spent by our members and in their shopping frequency the strengthening of foreign currencies favorably impacted comparable sales by approximately 1260 or 162 basis points during 2011 gasoline price inflation positively impacted comparable sales results by approximately 1679 or 220 basis points during 2011 reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations 

2010 vs 2009 

net sales 

net sales increased 6366 or 91 during 2010 compared to 2009 the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in comparable warehouse sales and the remainder primarily from sales at the 13 net new warehouses opened during 2010 14 opened and one closed due to a relocation 

foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar which positively impacted net sales during 2010 by approximately 1570 or 225 basis points net sales were also positively impacted by gasoline price inflation during 2010 by approximately 895 or 128 basis points which resulted from a 17 increase in the average sales price per gallon 

comparable sales 

comparable sales increased 7 in 2010 and were positively impacted primarily by an increase in shopping frequency strengthening foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately 1510 or 217 basis points in 2010 gasoline price inflation positively impacted comparable sales results by approximately 882 or 126 basis points during 2010 reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations 

membership fees 

 

   

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

2011 vs 2010 

membership fees increased 104 in 2011 excluding membership fees from mexico the increase would have been 83 in 2011 this increase was due to the higher penetration of our higherfee executive membership program and the additional membership signups at the 20 net new warehouses opened during 2011 our member renewal rates are consistent with recent years currently at 89 in the us and canada and approximately 86 on a worldwide basis 

foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar which positively impacted membership fees in 2011 by approximately 30 

2010 vs 2009 

membership fees increased 103 in 2010 compared to 2009 membership fees in 2010 were positively impacted due to the increased penetration of our higherfee executive membership program the continued benefit of membership signups at warehouses opened in 2009 a 2009 27 charge to membership fees related to a litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy and the additional membership signups at the 13 net new warehouses opened in 2010 our member renewal rate at the end of 2010 was 88 in the us and canada foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar in 2010 which positively impacted membership fees by approximately 36 

gross margin 

 

 2011 vs 2010 

gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 14 basis points compared to 2010 gross margin for core merchandise categories food and sundries hardlines softlines and fresh foods when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales rather than total net sales increased 18 basis points primarily due to hardlines and food and sundries however when the core merchandise gross margin is expressed as a percentage of total net sales it decreased two basis points from the prior year due primarily to the increased sales penetration of the lowermargin gasoline business warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margins decreased by two basis points as a percent of total net sales the gross margin comparison was negatively impacted by 87 or 10 basis points due to a lifo inventory charge recorded in 2011 the charge resulted from higher costs for our merchandise inventories primarily food and sundries and gasoline there was no lifo inventory charge recorded in 2010 

excluding the impact of consolidating mexico the gross margin comparison as a percent of net sales would have been a decrease of 18 basis points during 2011 foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar which positively impacted gross margin in 2011 by approximately 149 

2010 vs 2009 

gross margin as a percent of net sales increased two basis points compared to 2009 gross margin for core merchandise categories when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales rather than 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

total net sales increased 25 basis points yearoveryear with all categories showing increases however the increased sales penetration of the lower margin gasoline business caused this increase to be only six basis points when expressed as a percent of total net sales warehouse ancillary businesses gross margins increased by three basis points as a percent of total net sales in addition gross margin comparisons were negatively impacted by five basis points due to a favorable 32 lifo adjustment in 2009 compared to no lifo adjustment in 2010 increased penetration of the executive membership twopercent reward program and increased spending by executive members negatively affected gross margin by two basis points foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar in 2010 which positively impacted gross margin by approximately 183 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 2011 vs 2010 

sga expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 31 basis points compared to 2010 excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales the decrease was 11 basis points the yearoveryear decrease was due to a 15 basis point improvement in our warehouse operating costs largely payroll this improvement was partially offset by a nonrecurring benefit of 24 or three basis points recorded in fiscal 2010 related to the refund of a previously recorded canadian employee tax liability 

the consolidation of mexico which compared to our other operating segments has lower sga expenses as a percent of its own net sales favorably impacted sga expenses as a percent of net sales by seven basis points in 2011 foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar which negatively impacted sga during 2011 by approximately 116 

2010 vs 2009 

sga expenses as a percent of net sales improved ten basis points compared to 2009 excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales sga expense increased three basis points warehouse operating costs excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation increased seven basis points primarily due to higher employee benefit costs particularly employee healthcare and workers’ compensation sga expense comparisons were positively impacted by six basis points related to a 24 refund of a previously recorded canadian employee tax liability and a 23 charge recorded in 2009 to write down the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts with no comparable charge in 2010 foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar which negatively impacted sga for 2010 by approximately 140 

preopening expenses 

 

   

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses preopening expenses can vary due to the number of warehouse openings the timing of the opening relative to our yearend whether the warehouse is owned or leased and whether the opening is in an existing new or international market 

provision for impaired assets and closing costs net 

 

 this provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of longlived assets future lease obligations including contract termination costs of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities and accelerated depreciation based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired the impairment charge in 2009 primarily related to the closing of our two costco home locations 

at the end of 2011 and 2010 the reserve for warehouse closing costs was 5 and primarily related to future lease obligations and other contractual obligations associated with exiting the properties 

interest expense 

 

 interest expense primarily relates to our 900 of 53 and 1100 of 55 senior notes 2007 senior notes issued in fiscal 2007 the 53 senior notes are due march 15 2012 

interest income and other net 

 

 2011 vs 2010 

the increase in interest income yearoveryear was attributable to increases in our cash and cash equivalents including shortterm investments slightly higher interest rates and the consolidation of our mexico operations the decrease in earnings of affiliates and other net is primarily due to the previously discussed change in the accounting treatment of mexico see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report in addition there were net gains from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of 9 and 14 during 2011 and 2010 respectively see derivatives section in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

2010 vs 2009 

the decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances interest income also includes a 12 otherthantemporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 no impairment was recognized in 2010 

the increase in earnings of affiliates and other was primarily due to an increase in earnings from mexico which increased due to stronger sales and the mexican peso strengthening against the us dollar in addition there were net gains losses from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of 14 and 5 in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

provision for income taxes 

 

 the effective tax rate for 2011 was positively impacted by a tax refund received by mexico this benefit was offset by various discrete items recognized throughout the year 

the decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations the 2009 effective tax rate also included the unfavorable impact of a writedown on investments that were nondeductible for tax purposes 

liquidity and capital resources dollars in millions except per share data 

cash flows 

the following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets 

 

 our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances of these balances approximately 982 and 862 at the end of 2011 and 2010 respectively represented debit and credit card receivables primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 3198 in 2011 compared to 2780 in 2010 an increase of 418 this increase was primarily attributable to a 219 increase in net income including noncontrolling interests an 87 increase from the change in other current operating assets and liabilities a 77 increase in deferred income taxes and a 60 increase in depreciation and amortization partially offset by an increase in our net investment in merchandise inventories merchandise inventories less accounts payable of 70 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1180 in 2011 compared to 2015 in 2010 a decrease of 835 this decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to an 896 decrease in cash used in the 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

net investment in shortterm investments and a 165 cash increase representing the cash and cash equivalents on mexico’s balance sheet as of august 29 2010 partially offset by an increase in cash used for capital expenditures of 235 mexico was consolidated as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 due to the adoption of a new accounting standard see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 1277 in 2011 compared to 719 in 2010 an increase of 558 this increase was primarily attributable to a 73 increase in cash used to repurchase costco’s common stock and a 519 reduction in the amount of bank checks outstanding the reduction in bank checks outstanding is due to maintaining higher balances in banks on which our checks are drawn 

exchange rate changes increased cash and cash equivalents by 54 in 2011 compared to an increase of 11 in 2010 an increase of 43 this increase was due to the strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar during 2011 

management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future we have not provided for us deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of 2646 and 1972 at the end of 2011 and 2010 respectively of certain nonus consolidated subsidiaries and other entities including our 50 owned investment in mexico as such earnings are deemed by us to be indefinitely reinvested cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by these consolidated subsidiaries and other entities may not be available to be used for certain financing activities such as the repayment of shortterm debt or to repurchase common stock at august 28 2011 cash and cash equivalent balances and shortterm investments of 1828 were held by these nonus consolidated subsidiaries and other entities

 expansion plans 

our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land buildings and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses to a lesser extent capital is required for initial warehouse operations and working capital while there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review it is our current intention to spend approximately 1400 to 1600 during fiscal 2012 for real estate construction remodeling and equipment for warehouses and related operations these expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

we plan to open up to 20 net new warehouses in 2012 and at least one relocation of an existing warehouse to a larger and betterlocated facility in addition the closed warehouse in japan is expected to reopen in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 

we opened 20 net new warehouses in 2011 and spent 1290 on capital expenditures

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

derivatives 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchangerate fluctuations in the normal course of business we manage these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreignexchange contracts seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreignexchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency the contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge our exposure to us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the us dollar currently these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting we seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions these contracts do not contain any creditriskrelated contingent features 

we seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships there can be no assurance however that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk these contracts are limited to less than one year in duration see note 1 and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information on the fair value of open unsettled forward foreignexchange contracts as of august 28 2011 and august 29 2010 

we are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume particularly electricity and natural gas which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixedprice contracts for approximately 36 of our warehouses and other facilities primarily in the us and canada we also enter into variablepriced contracts for some purchases of natural gas in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis these contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the “normal purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no marktomarket adjustment 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements 

stock repurchase programs 

in april 2011 our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in the amount of 4000 expiring in april 2015 bringing total authorizations by our board of directors since inception of the program in 2001 to 10800 the authorization in april 2011 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling 792 

during 2011 we repurchased 8939000 shares of common stock at an average price of 7174 per share totaling approximately 641 during 2010 we repurchased 9943000 shares of common stock at an average price of 5714 per share totaling approximately 568 the remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was 3706 at the end of 2011 purchases are made from timetotime as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under sec rule 10b51 repurchased shares are retired in accordance with the washington business corporation act

we generally recognize sales net of estimated returns at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis 

we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when we are the primary obligor subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers influence product or service specifications or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded on a gross basis if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above we record the net amounts as commissions earned which is reflected in net sales 

membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members we account for membership fee revenue net of estimated refunds on a deferred basis whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the oneyear membership period 

our executive members qualify for a 2 reward which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses up to a maximum of approximately 500 per year on qualified purchases made at costco we account for this 2 reward as a reduction in sales with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of nonredemptions based on historical data 

investments 

investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment we employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor issuer conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

merchandise inventories 

merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method and are stated using the lastin firstout lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the firstin firstout fifo method we believe the lifo method

more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues we record an adjustment each quarter if necessary for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at yearend due to inflation in 2011 the merchandise inventories valued at lifo were lower than the fifo value resulting in a charge to merchandise costs of 87 during 2009 due to overall net deflationary trends the company recorded a 32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at lifo at the end of 2010 and 2009 merchandise inventories valued at lifo approximated fifo after considering the lower of cost or market principle 

we provide for estimated inventory losses shrink between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year 

inventory cost where appropriate is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones terms of agreement or other systematic and rational approaches 

impairment of longlived assets and warehouse closing costs 

we periodically evaluate our longlived assets for indicators of impairment such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their thencurrent fair market value 

we provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations these estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets we make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location we reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change 

insuranceselfinsurance liabilities 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including a whollyowned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool to provide for potential liabilities for workers’ compensation general liability property damage directors and officers liability vehicle liability and employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate

 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds us government and agency securities federal deposit insurance corporation insured corporate notes and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields the majority of our shortterm investments are in fixed interest rate securities these securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations a revised investment policy was approved in december 2007 by our board of directors limiting future investments to direct us government and government agency obligations repurchase agreements collateralized by us government and government agency obligations and us government and government agency money market funds 

the investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields our whollyowned insurance subsidiary invests in us government and government agency obligations corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgagebacked securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of aa all of our foreign subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds investment grade securities bankers’ acceptances bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies additionally our canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in us dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current us dollar obligations 

because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are shortterm interest rate changes are less likely to be material to our financial statements based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately 29 and 23 pretax respectively to interest income on an annual basis for those investments that are classified as availableforsale the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 

the nature and amount of our long and shortterm debt may vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors as of the end of 2011 our fixedrate longterm debt included 1100 of 55 senior notes carried at 1097 900 of 53 senior notes carried at 900 38 principal amount at maturity of 35 zero coupon convertible subordinated notes carried at 31 and additional notes totaling 86 additionally our variable rate longterm debt included a 035 over yen tibor 6month term loan of 39 fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixedrate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for more information on our long and shortterm debt 

  

item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued 

  

foreign currencyexchange risk 

our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their nonfunctional currencies which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates we manage these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency as of august 28 2011 and august 29 2010 we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of 247 and 225 respectively at the end of 2011 the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets were 1 and 2 respectively at the end of 2010 the fair value of assets and liabilities were 1 and 3 respectively a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the functional currency compared to the nonfunctional currency exchange rates at august 28 2011 and august 29 2010 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by 25 and 23 respectively

 item 1—business 

costco wholesale corporation and its subsidiaries “costco” or the “company” began operations in 1983 in seattle washington in october 1993 we merged with the price company which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept to form pricecostco inc a delaware corporation in january 1997 after the spinoff of most of our nonwarehouse assets to price enterprises inc we changed our name to costco companies inc on august 30 1999 we reincorporated from delaware to washington and changed our name to costco wholesale corporation our common stock trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “cost” 

general 

we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected privatelabel products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover this turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers mass merchandisers supermarkets and supercenters 

we buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a crossdocking consolidation point “depot” or directly to our warehouses our depots receive containerbased shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses generally in less than twentyfour hours this maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional multiplestep distribution channels such traditional steps include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers use of central receiving storing and distributing warehouses and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor 

because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover we generally sell inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors even though we take advantage of early payment discounts when available to the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital 

our typical warehouse format averages approximately 143000 square feet newer units tend to be larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices our warehouses need not have elaborate facilities by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format we have limited inventory losses shrinkage to less than twotenths of one percent of net sales in the last several fiscal years—well below those of typical discount retail operations 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

we generally limit marketing and promotional activities to new warehouse openings occasional direct mail to prospective new members and regular direct marketing programs such as the costco connection a magazine we publish for our members coupon mailers weekly email blasts from costcocom and handouts to existing members promoting selected merchandise these practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical retailers in connection with new warehouse openings our marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential business members these contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening potential gold star individual members are contacted by direct mail or by membership offerings distributed through employee associations and other entities after a membership base is established in an area most new memberships result from wordofmouth advertising followup messages distributed through employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective members 

our warehouses generally operate on a sevenday 69hour week open weekdays between 1000 am and 830 pm with earlier closing hours on the weekend gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers discount retailers and supermarkets and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking 

our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere we seek to limit specific items in each product line to fastselling models sizes and colors therefore we carry an average of approximately 3900 active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business as opposed to 45000 to 140000 skus or more at discount retailers supermarkets and supercenters many consumable products are offered for sale only in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise on certain electronic items we have a 90day return policy in the united states canada and the united kingdom and provide free of charge technical support services as well as an extended warranty 

the following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by major category of items

ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently the following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal year end 

 

 costco mexico our 50owned joint venture operated 32 warehouses at august 29 2010 we have contractual responsibility for executive management and functional duties and operations of costco mexico the costco mexico warehouses are not included in the table above as costco mexico is accounted for using the equity method of accounting for investments 

our electronic commerce businesses costcocom in the us and costcoca in canada provide our members additional products generally not found in our warehouses in addition to services such as digital photo processing pharmacy travel and membership services 

our warehouses accept cash checks certain debit cards american express and a private label costco credit card losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from making further purchases until restitution is made 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brandname merchandise we do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business we also purchase selected private label merchandise as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to name brand items 

certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

we report on a 5253week fiscal year consisting of thirteen fourweek periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august the first three quarters consist of three periods each and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53week year the material seasonal impact in our operations is an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season references to 2010 2009 and 2008 relate to the 52week fiscal years ended august 29 2010 august 30 2009 and august 31 2008 respectively 

membership policy 

our membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue members can utilize their memberships at any costco warehouse location in 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

any country we have two primary types of members business and gold star individual our member renewal rate currently at 88 in the us and canada is consistent with recent years businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or other evidence of business existence may become business members business members generally pay an annual membership fee of 50 for the primary and household membership card with addon membership cards available for an annual fee of 40 including a free household card many of our business members also shop at costco for their personal needs individual memberships gold star memberships are available to individuals who do not qualify for a business membership for an annual fee of 50 which includes a household card 

our membership base was made up of the following in thousands 

 

 these numbers exclude approximately 2900 cardholders of costco mexico at the end of 2010 and 2800 cardholders at the end of 2009 and 2008 

executive membership is available to all members with the exception of business addon members in the us canada mexico and the united kingdom for an annual fee of approximately 100 the program in the us and canada offers additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services such as merchant creditcard processing auto and home insurance the costco auto purchase program and check printing services the services are generally provided by thirdparties and vary by country and state in addition executive members qualify for a 2 annual reward which can be redeemed at costco warehouses up to a maximum of approximately 500 per year on qualified purchases made at costco at the end of 2010 2009 and 2008 executive members represented 36 33 and 30 respectively of our primary membership base that was eligible for the program executive members generally spend more than other members and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection warehouse location and member service we compete with 800 warehouse club locations across the us and canada walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club and every major metropolitan area has multiple club operations in addition we compete with a wide range of national and regional retailers and wholesalers including supermarkets supercenters general merchandise chains specialty chains and gasoline stations as well as electronic commerce businesses competitors such as walmart target kohl’s and amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors we also compete with lowcost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such as lowe’s home depot office depot petsmart staples trader joe’s whole foods best buy and barnes  noble our international operations face similar competitors 

regulation 

certain state laws require that we apply minimum markups to our selling prices for specific goods such as tobacco products alcoholic beverages and gasoline while compliance with such laws may cause us to charge higher prices other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions and we believe that compliance with such laws currently in effect do not have a material adverse effect on our operations 

certain states counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us within their jurisdictions if enacted such laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our operations 

intellectual property 

we believe that our trademarks trade names copyrights proprietary processes trade secrets patents trade dress and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important factors in our success we have invested significantly in the development and protection of our wellrecognized brands including the costco wholesale ® series of trademarks and our private label brand kirkland signature ®  kirkland signature products are premium products offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for national brand products kirkland signature products allow us to ensure our quality standards are met while minimizing costs and differentiating our merchandise offerings from other retailers and to generally earn higher margins we expect that our private label items will increase their share of our sales in the future we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate

 item 1a—risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results or events predicted by our forwardlooking statements those statements may relate to such matters as sales growth increases in comparable store sales cannibalization of existing locations by new openings price changes earnings performance earnings per share stockbased compensation expense warehouse openings and closures the effect of adopting certain accounting standards future financial reporting financing margins return on invested capital strategic direction expense control membership renewal rates shopping frequency litigation impact and the demand for our products and services you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this report there may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not presently perceive them to be material that could cause results to differ materially from our expectations or statements forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these forwardlooking statements you are advised to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic filings with the sec 

we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators which could negatively affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for members employees sites products and services and in other important respects with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries we compete with other warehouse club operators discount retailers supermarkets supercenter stores retail and wholesale grocers department drug variety and specialty stores and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors as well as internetbased retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise pricing selection and availability services location convenience store hours and price our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could negatively affect our financial performance some competitors may have greater financial resources better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance 

higher interest rates energy costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs consumer debt levels unsettled financial markets weaknesses in housing and real estate markets reduced consumer confidence changes related to government fiscal and tax policies and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell prices of certain commodity products including gasoline and other food products are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins these factors can also increase our merchandise costs andor selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and results general economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

our growth strategy includes expanding our business both in existing markets and in new markets 

our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of constructing leasing and operating our warehouses we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively will affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses which may have a material adverse affect on our future growth and profitability 

we seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses 

we also intend to open warehouses in new markets the risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us attracting members of other wholesale club operators currently operating in the new market our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence in new markets we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed as a result our future profitability may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our united states and canada operations 

our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our united states and canada operations which comprised 92 of consolidated net sales in 2010 and 93 in 2009 and 89 of operating income in 2010 and 92 in 2009 within the united states we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 26 and 27 of consolidated net sales in 2010 and 2009 respectively our california market in general has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other markets any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our united states operations particularly in california and our canada operations could arise from among other things failing to meet targets for warehouse openings declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor healthcare and energy costs cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets and failing consistently to provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members 

we depend on vendors to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices we have no assurances of continued supply pricing or access to new products and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us member demands may lead to outofstock positions of our merchandise leading to loss of sales and profits 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

 

we purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited particularly for certain food items the large volume we demand may not be consistently available 

our suppliers are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity inclement weather natural disasters supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise for these or other reasons one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control legal or regulatory standards these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members this failure could lead to litigation and recalls which could damage our reputation and our brands increase our costs and otherwise hurt our business 

in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods security and safety regulations trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control and could adversely impact our sourcing of goods 

we depend on our depot operations to effectively and efficiently supply product to our warehouses 

we depend on the orderly operation of the receiving and distribution process primarily through our depots although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires hurricanes earthquakes or other catastrophic events labor shortages and disagreements or shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand our success depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including those relating to sustainability of product sources and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly we may have excess inventory which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance this could have an adverse effect on margins and operating income 

our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our financial results 

damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales lower employee morale and productivity diminish member trust and reduce member renewal rates and accordingly membership fee revenues resulting in a reduction in shareholder value

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition sales returns reserves impairment of longlived assets and warehouse closing costs inventories selfinsurance income taxes unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance provisions for losses related to selfinsured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 were enacted this legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured we expect our healthcare costs to increase but not materially as a result of this legislation similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

changes in tax rates 

we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate as the tax rates vary among countries a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision additionally any change in the enacted tax rates any adverse outcome in connection with any income tax audits in any jurisdiction including transfer pricing disputes or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

failure of our internal control over financial reporting could make our financial results inaccurate or untimely 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements providing reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to and cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our financial performance 

our international operations are growing future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many beyond our control and similar to those we face in the united states these factors include political conditions economic conditions regulatory constraints currency regulations and exchange rates and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries laws and regulations of foreign governments and the united states such as the foreign corrupt practices act agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the united states risks inherent in international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations 

market expectations for our financial performance is high 

we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates margins earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase policies 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and backup systems could harm our business 

although we believe that we have independent redundant and primary and secondary computer systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes and errors by our employees if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in our computer systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations the costs potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or provide them in a delayed or more costly manner 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events could unfavorably affect our financial performance 

natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes particularly in california or in washington state where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located could unfavorably affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots the temporary

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters 

any failure to comply with these laws could result in costs to satisfy environmental compliance remediation or compensatory requirements or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our operations 

factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business 

we use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in our distribution and sale operations increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability in addition climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience we also sell a substantial amount of gasoline the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which also could face increased regulation climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornados and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels extreme weather conditions increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may unfavorably affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits including grand jury investigations other government investigations consumer employment tort and other litigation see discussion of legal proceedings in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could unfavorably affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources our business requires compliance with a great variety of laws and regulations failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards fines and penalties

key items for 2010 included 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is sales growth particularly comparable sales growth comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing the frequency with which our members shop and the amounts they spend on each visit sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control including fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions primarily impacting domestic operations the higher our comparable sales not associated with currency fluctuations the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business especially the united states adverse economic conditions negatively impacted spending by our customers during 2009 and 2010 and that negative impact may continue sales growth and our gross margin are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread including other warehouse clubs discount department drug variety and 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

specialty stores and supermarkets as well as internet retailers while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our private label items our philosophy is not to focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged but to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority”—consistently providing the most competitive values this may cause us for example to absorb increases in merchandise costs at certain times rather than immediately passing them along to our members negatively impacting gross margin 

we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses and relocating existing warehouses to larger facilities as our warehouse base grows and available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth but the negative aspects of such growth including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouse when openings occur in existing markets are ameliorated our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to continue 

our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically some significant costs are partially outside our control most particularly health care expenses with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn rather we believe that achieving our longerterm objectives of reducing turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business is operated on very low margins modest changes in various items in the income statement particularly gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses can have substantial impacts on net income 

results of operations 

net sales 

 

 2010 vs 2009 

net sales 

net sales increased 91 during 2010 compared to 2009 the 6366 increase was comprised of a 4871 increase in comparable sales and the remainder primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2010 and 2009

our sales results continue to be negatively impacted by general economic conditions and those conditions may continue to have a significant adverse impact on spending by our members we believe however that due to the nature of our business model we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment 

comparable sales 

comparable sales increased 7 in 2010 and were positively impacted primarily by an increase in shopping frequency strengthening foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately 1510 217 basis points in 2010 gasoline price inflation positively impacted comparable sales results by approximately 882 126 basis points during 2010 reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

 

2010 vs 2009 

membership fees increased 103 in 2010 compared to 2009 membership fees in 2010 were positively impacted due to the increased penetration of our higherfee executive membership program the continued benefit of membership signups at warehouses opened in 2009 and 2008 a 2009 27 charge to membership fees related to a litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy and the additional membership signups at the 13 new warehouses opened in 2010 14 opened and one closed due to a relocation our member renewal rate currently at 88 in the us and canada is consistent with recent years 

foreign currencies particularly in canada korea and japan strengthened against the us dollar in 2010 which positively impacted membership fees by approximately 36 

2009 vs 2008 

membership fees increased 18 in 2009 compared to 2008 the increase was primarily due to membership signups at the 15 new warehouses opened in 2009 19 opened two closed due to relocations and two closed costco home locations the continued benefit of membership signups at warehouses opened in 2008 and increased penetration of our higherfee executive membership program this increase was negatively impacted by the 27 charge for the litigation settlement discussed above the weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar particularly in canada the united kingdom and korea which negatively impacted membership fees during 2009 by approximately 50 and a lower number of warehouse openings yearoveryear our member renewal rate at the end of 2009 was 87 in the us and canada

gross margin as a percent of net sales increased two basis points compared to 2009 the core merchandise gross margin when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales and not total net sales increased 25 basis points yearoveryear with all categories showing increases however the increased sales penetration of the lower margin gasoline business caused this increase to be only six basis points when expressed as a percent of total net sales warehouse ancillary businesses gross margins increased by three basis points as a percent of total net sales in addition gross margin comparisons were negatively impacted by five basis points due to a favorable lifo adjustment in 2009 compared to no adjustment in 2010 increased penetration of the executive membership twopercent reward program and increased spending by executive members negatively affected gross margin by two basis points

2009 vs 2008 

gross margin as a percent of net sales increased 28 basis points compared to 2008 this increase was primarily related to a net 18 basis point increase in our core merchandise departments primarily in food and sundries partially offset by a decrease in softlines and a net seven basis point increase from our warehouse ancillary businesses primarily our gasoline and pharmacy departments the majority of this gross margin improvement was due to our lower margin gas business having lower sales penetration resulting from the decline in the average selling price per gallon increased sales penetration of the executive membership twopercent reward program negatively affected gross margin by six basis points in addition gross margin was favorably impacted by nine basis points due to reversing the 32 lifo reserve established in the prior year as we experienced net deflation yearoveryear in the cost of our merchandise inventories

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 2010 vs 2009 

sga expenses as a percent of net sales improved ten basis points compared to 2009 if the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales in 2010 is excluded these expenses increased three basis points compared to 2009 warehouse operating costs excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation increased seven basis points primarily due to higher employee benefit costs particularly employee healthcare and workers’ compensation sga expense comparisons were positively impacted by six basis points related to the recovery of amounts expensed in fiscal 2007 and 2008 on behalf of certain employees in canada to cover adverse tax consequences resulting from our previously announced stock option investigation and a charge recorded in 2009 to write down the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts with no comparable charge this year 

foreign currencies particularly in canada korea and japan strengthened against the us dollar which negatively impacted sga for 2010 by approximately 140 

2009 vs 2008 

sga expenses as a percent of net sales increased 58 basis points compared to 2008 increased warehouse operating and central administrative costs as a percent of net sales negatively impacted sga by approximately 56 basis points resulting primarily from lower sales levels and higher employee health care costs higher stockbased compensation expense had a negative impact of one basis point in addition we recorded an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts which negatively impacted sga as a percent of net sales by two basis points the net realizable value of the insurance contracts is largely based on

changes in investment assets underlying the policies and is subject to conditions generally affecting equity and debt markets in 2008 we recorded a 16 reserve in connection with a legal settlement which positively impacted the comparison to current year’s sga expense as a percent of net sales by two basis points 

sga expenses as a percent of net sales for 2009 were adversely impacted by the decrease in the price of gasoline as it produced a decline in sales dollars without a comparative reduction in labor or other administrative costs foreign currencies particularly in canada the united kingdom and korea weakened against the us dollar which positively impacted sga for 2009 by approximately 217 

preopening expenses 

 

 preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of operations at existing warehouses preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the warehouse opening relative to our yearend whether the warehouse is owned or leased and whether the opening is in an existing new or international market the 2009 preopening expense included costs related to several international warehouses that opened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 

provision for impaired assets and closing costs net 

 

 this provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of longlived assets future lease obligations of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities accelerated depreciation based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired and gains and losses resulting from the sale of real property largely comprised of former warehouse locations

interest income and other net 

 

 2010 vs 2009 

the decrease in interest income is due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances interest income also includes a 12 otherthantemporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 no impairment was recognized in 2010 

the increase in earnings of affiliates and other is primarily due to an increase in earnings from our 50 owned jointventure in mexico costco mexico’s earnings increased due to stronger sales and the mexican peso strengthening against the us dollar the net gain on foreign currency transactions was 13 in 2010 but was not significant in 2009 these amounts generally relate to the difference between the foreign exchange rate in effect when title to merchandise inventory is transferred and the rate at the time of payment in addition there was a favorable 1 marktomarket adjustment in 2010 compared to a negative 5 adjustment in 2009 related to our forward foreign exchange contracts see derivatives section for more information 

2009 vs 2008 

the decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in us government and agency securities which earn lower interest rates in addition we recognized 12 of otherthantemporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 compared to an impairment loss of 5 in 2008 the decrease in the earnings of affiliates was primarily attributable to lower earnings by our investment in costco mexico costco mexico’s earnings were lower in 2009 primarily due to the peso weakening against the us dollar in addition there was a negative 5 marktomarket adjustment in 2009 compared to a favorable 6 adjustment in 2008 related to our forward foreign exchange contracts 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

provision for income taxes 

 

 the decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 is primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations the 2009 effective tax rates also include the unfavorable impact of a writedown on investments that were nondeductible for tax purposes 

the lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year 

net income attributable to costco net income 

 

 2010 vs 2009 

net income for 2010 increased to 1303 or 292 per diluted share from 1086 or 247 per diluted share during 2009 representing an 18 increase in diluted net income per share as previously discussed foreign currencies particularly in canada korea and japan strengthened against the us dollar which positively impacted net income for 2010 by approximately 61 aftertax or 014 per diluted share various factors discussed in detail above including sales membership fees gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses contributed to the increase in net income for 2010

 expansion plans 

our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land buildings and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses to a lesser extent capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital while there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review it is our current intention to spend approximately 1600 during fiscal 2011 for real estate construction remodeling and equipment for warehouses and related operations these expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

we plan to open up to 31 new warehouses in 2011 including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and betterlocated facilities

 derivatives 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchangerate fluctuations in the normal course of our business which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

currency the contracts are intended primarily to hedge us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures currently these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting we seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions these contracts do not contain any creditriskrelated contingent features 

we seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships there can be no assurance however that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk the contracts are limited to less than one year see note 1 and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information related to these contracts 

we are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices particularly electricity and natural gas which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixedprice contracts for approximately 26 of our warehouses and other facilities in the us and canada we also enter into variablepriced contracts for some purchases of natural gas in addition to fuel for our gas stations on an index basis these contracts generally qualify for treatment as normal purchases or normal sales and require no marktomarket adjustment 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

with the exception of our operating leases we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements 

stock repurchase programs 

in september and november of 2007 our board of directors approved 300 and 1000 respectively of stock repurchases which expire in august 2010 and november 2010 in july 2008 our board of directors approved an additional 1000 which expires in july 2011 bringing total authorizations by our board of directors since inception of the program in 2001 to 6800 

during 2010 we repurchased 9943000 shares of common stock at an average price of 5714 per share totaling approximately 568 during 2009 we repurchased 895000 shares of common stock at an average price of 6384 per share totaling approximately 57 the remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was 1434 at the end of 2010 434 of which expires in november 2010 purchases are made from timetotime as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under sec rule 10b51 repurchased shares are retired in accordance with the washington business corporation act 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments we continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition investments merchandise inventory valuation impairment of longlived assets warehouse closing costs insuranceselfinsurance liabilities and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

revenue recognition 

we generally recognize sales net of estimated returns at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis 

we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when we are the primary obligor subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers influence product or service specifications or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded on a gross basis if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above we record the net amounts as commissions earned which is reflected in net sales 

membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members we account for membership fee revenue net of estimated refunds on a deferred basis whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the oneyear membership period 

our executive members qualify for a 2 reward which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses up to a maximum of 500 per year on qualified purchases made at costco we account for this 2 reward as a reduction in sales with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of nonredemptions based on historical data 

investments 

investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment we employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor issuer conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

merchandise inventories 

merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the lastin firstout lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the firstin firstout fifo method we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues we record an adjustment each quarter if necessary for the expected annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at yearend at the end of 2008 due to overall net inflationary trends merchandise 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

inventories valued at lifo were lower than the fifo value resulting in a 32 charge to merchandise costs during 2009 due to overall deflationary trends we recorded a 32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at lifo at the end of 2010 and 2009 merchandise inventories valued at lifo approximated fifo after considering the lower of cost or market principle 

we provide for estimated inventory losses shrink between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year 

inventory cost where appropriate is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones terms of agreement or other systematic and rational approaches 

impairment of longlived assets and warehouse closing costs 

we periodically evaluate our longlived assets for indicators of impairment such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their thencurrent fair market value 

we provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated a considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations these estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets we make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location we reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change 

insuranceself insurance liabilities 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including a whollyowned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool to provide for potential liabilities for workers’ compensation general liability property damage director and officers’ liability vehicle liability and employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

income taxes 

at the beginning of 2008 we adopted authoritative guidance related to uncertain tax positions which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate

 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds us government and agency debt securities federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insured corporate notes and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields the majority of our shortterm investments are in fixed interest rate securities these securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations a revised investment policy was approved in december 2007 by our board of directors limiting future investments to direct us government and government agency obligations repurchase agreements collateralized by us government and government agency obligations and us government and government agency money market funds 

the investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields our whollyowned insurance subsidiary invests in us government and government agency obligations corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgagebacked securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of aaa 

all of our foreign subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds investment grade securities bankers’ acceptances bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies additionally our canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in us dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current us dollar obligations 

because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are shortterm interest rate changes are not likely be material to our financial statements based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2010 and 2009 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately 23 and 24 pretax respectively to interest income on an annual basis for those investments that are classified as availableforsale the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 

the nature and amount of our long and shortterm debt may vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors as of the end of 2010 our fixedrate longterm debt included 41 principal amount at maturity of 35 zero coupon convertible subordinated notes carried at 32 900 of 53 senior notes carried at 899 and 1100 of 55 senior notes carried at 1096 and additional notes totaling 78 additionally our variable rate longterm debt included a 035 over yen tibor 6month term loan of 35 fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixedrate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt see 

  

item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued 

  

note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for more information on our long and shortterm debt 

foreign currencyexchange risk 

our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their nonfunctional currencies which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we manage these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency 

as of august 29 2010 and august 30 2009 we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of 225 and 183 respectively at the end of 2010 and 2009 fair value assets of 1 and 2 respectively and a fair value liabilities of 3 and 4 respectively were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the functional currency compared to the nonfunctional currency exchange rates at august 29 2010 and august 30 2009 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by 23 and 18 respectively

 item 1—business 

costco wholesale corporation and its subsidiaries “costco” or the “company” began operations in 1983 in seattle washington in october 1993 we merged with the price company which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept to form pricecostco inc a delaware corporation in january 1997 after the spinoff of most of our nonwarehouse assets to price enterprises inc we changed our name to costco companies inc on august 30 1999 we reincorporated from delaware to washington and changed our name to costco wholesale corporation our common stock trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “cost” 

general 

we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected privatelabel products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover this rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers mass merchandisers supermarkets and supercenters 

we buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a crossdocking consolidation point “depot” or directly to our warehouses our depots receive containerbased shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses generally in less than twentyfour hours this maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies lowering our receiving costs by eliminating many of the costs associated with multiplestep distribution channels such traditional steps include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers use of central receiving storing and distributing warehouses and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor 

because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover we generally have the opportunity to sell and be paid for inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors even though we take advantage of early payment discounts whenever available to us to the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital 

our typical warehouse format averages approximately 143000 square feet newer units tend to be larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices our warehouses need not have elaborate facilities by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format we have limited inventory losses shrinkage to less than twotenths of one percent of net sales in the last several fiscal years—well below those of typical discount retail operations 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

we generally limit marketing and promotional activities to new warehouse openings occasional direct mail to prospective new members and regular direct marketing programs such as the costco connection a magazine we publish for our members coupon mailers weekly email blasts from costcocom and handouts to existing members promoting selected merchandise these practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical retailers in connection with new warehouse openings our marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members these contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening potential gold star individual members are contacted by direct mail or by membership offerings distributed through employee associations and other entities after a membership base is established in an area most new memberships result from wordofmouth advertising followup messages distributed through employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective members 

our warehouses generally operate on a sevenday 69hour week open weekdays between 1000 am and 830 pm with earlier closing hours on the weekend gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers discount retailers and supermarkets and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking 

our merchandising strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere we seek to limit specific items in each product line to fastselling models sizes and colors therefore we carry an average of approximately 3800 active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business as opposed to 45000 to 140000 skus or more at discount retailers supermarkets and supercenters many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise on certain electronic items we have a 90day return policy in the united states canada and the united kingdom and provide free of charge technical support services as well as an extended warranty 

the following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by major category of items 

 

   

item 1—business continued 

  

ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently the following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal year end 

 

 costco mexico our 50owned joint venture operated 32 warehouses under our oversight at august 30 2009 the costco mexico warehouses are not included in the table above as costco mexico is accounted for using the equity method of accounting for investments 

our electronic commerce businesses costcocom in the us and costcoca in canada provide our members additional products generally not found in our warehouses in addition to services such as digital photo processing pharmacy travel and membership services 

our warehouses accept cash checks certain debit cards american express and a private label costco credit card losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from making payments at the point of sale until restitution is made 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brandname merchandise we do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business we also purchase selected private label merchandise as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to name brand items 

certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

we report on a 5253week fiscal year consisting of thirteen fourweek periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august the first three quarters consist of three periods each and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53week year there is no material seasonal impact on our operations except an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season references to 2009 2008 and 2007 relate to the 52week fiscal years ended august 30 2009 august 31 2008 and september 2 2007 respectively 

membership policy 

our membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue which allows us to offer lower prices members can utilize their memberships 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

at any costco warehouse location in any country we have two primary types of members business and gold star individual we continue to experience strong member renewal rates currently at 87 businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or other evidence of business existence may become business members business members generally pay an annual membership fee of 50 for the primary and spouse membership card with addon membership cards available for an annual fee of 40 including a free spouse card many of our business members also shop at costco for their personal needs individual memberships gold star memberships are available to individuals who do not qualify for a business membership for an annual fee of 50 which includes a spouse card 

our membership base was made up of the following in thousands 

 

 these numbers exclude approximately 2800 2800 and 2700 cardholders of costco mexico at the end of 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

executive membership is available to all members in the us canada and united kingdom for an annual fee of approximately 100 the program offers additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services offered by costco such as merchant creditcard processing auto and home insurance business telephone service and check printing services the services are generally provided by thirdparties and vary by country and state in addition executive members qualify for a 2 annual reward which can be redeemed at costco warehouses up to a maximum of approximately 500 per year on all qualified purchases made at costco at the end of 2009 2008 and 2007 executive members represented 29 26 and 23 respectively of our primary membership base executive members spend more than other members and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase in 2008 costco mexico launched an executive membership program similar to the program in the us and canada 

labor 

our employee count approximated 

 

 these numbers exclude approximately 9000 individuals who were employed by costco mexico at the end of 2009 2008 and 2007 approximately 13500 hourly employees in certain of our locations all former price company locations in five states are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters all remaining employees are nonunion we consider our employee relations to be very good

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection warehouse location and member service over 1200 warehouse club locations exist across the us and canada including our 483 north american warehouses and every major metropolitan area has several club operations in addition to other membership warehouse operators such as walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club we compete with a wide range of national and regional retailers and wholesalers including supermarkets supercenters general merchandise chains specialty chains gasoline stations as well as electronic commerce businesses such as amazon walmart target and kohl’s are significant general merchandise retail competitors we also compete with lowcost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such as lowe’s home depot office depot petsmart staples trader joe’s whole foods best buy and barnes  noble our international operations face similar competitors 

regulation 

certain state laws require that we apply minimum markups to our selling prices for specific goods such as tobacco products alcoholic beverages and gasoline while compliance with such laws may cause us to charge higher prices other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions and we believe that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on our operations 

certain states counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us within their jurisdictions we believe that if enacted such laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our operations 

intellectual property 

we believe that our trademarks trade names copyrights proprietary processes trade secrets patents trade dress and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important factors in our success we have invested significantly in the development and protection of our wellrecognized brands including costco wholesale and our premium private label brand kirkland signature ®  kirkland signature products are premium products offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for national brand products kirkland signature products allow us to ensure our quality standards are met while minimizing costs and differentiating our merchandise offerings from other retailers and we generally earn higher margins on sales of kirkland products we expect that our private label items will increase their share of our sales in the future we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate

 item 1a—risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition andor results of operations these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by our forwardlooking statements those statements may relate to such matters as sales growth increases in comparable store sales impact of cannibalization price changes earnings performance earnings per share stockbased compensation expense warehouse openings and closures the effect of adopting certain accounting standards future financial reporting financing margins return on invested capital strategic direction expense control membership renewal rates shopping frequency litigation impact and the demand for our products and services you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this report there may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not presently perceive them to be material that could cause results to differ materially from our expectations forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these forwardlooking statements you are advised to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic filings with the sec 

we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators which could negatively affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for members employees warehouse sites products and services and in other important respects with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries we compete with other warehouse club operators discount retailers supermarkets supercenter stores retail and wholesale grocers department drug variety and specialty stores and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors as well as internetbased retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise pricing selection and availability services location convenience store hours and price our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could negatively affect our financial performance some competitors may have greater financial resources better access to merchandise andor greater market penetration than we do 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance 

higher interest rates energy costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs consumer debt levels unsettled financial markets weaknesses in housing and real estate markets reduced consumer confidence changes related to government fiscal and tax policies and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell prices of certain commodity products including gasoline and other food products are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins these factors can also increase our merchandise costs andor selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and results general economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

our growth strategy includes expanding our business both in existing markets and in new markets 

our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of constructing leasing and operating our warehouses we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively will affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses which may have a material adverse affect on our future growth and profitability 

we seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas a new warehouse may draw members away from our nearby existing warehouses and may adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses 

we also intend to open warehouses in new markets the risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us attracting members of other wholesale club operators currently operating in the new market our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence in new markets we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed as a result our future profitability may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our united states and canada operations 

our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our united states and canada operations which comprised 93 of consolidated net sales in 2009 and 2008 and 92 of operating income in 2009 and 2008 within the united states we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 27 of consolidated net sales in 2009 and 2008 our california market in general has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other markets as a result the operating income from our california operations is generally higher as a percentage of total operating income than other regions any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our united states operations particularly in california and our canada operations could arise from among other things failing to meet targets for warehouse openings declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor healthcare and energy costs cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets and failing consistently to provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members 

we depend on vendors to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices we have no assurances of continued supply pricing or access to new products and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us member demands may lead to outofstock positions of our merchandise leading to loss of sales and profits 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

we purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors 

our suppliers are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity inclement weather natural disasters supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise for these or other reasons one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control legal or regulatory standards these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members this failure could lead to litigation and recalls which could damage our reputation and our brands increase our costs and otherwise hurt our business 

in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods security and safety regulations trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control 

we depend on our depot operations to effectively and efficiently supply product to our warehouses 

we depend on the orderly operation of the receiving and distribution process primarily through our depots although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires hurricanes or other catastrophic events labor disagreements or shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly we may have excess inventory which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance this could have an adverse effect on margins and operating income 

our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our financial results 

damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales lower employee morale and productivity diminish member trust and reduce member renewal rates and accordingly membership fee revenues resulting in a reduction in shareholder value 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition sales returns reserves impairment of longlived assets and warehouse closing costs inventories selfinsurance income taxes unclaimed property laws and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance provisions for losses related to selfinsured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

changes in tax rates 

we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate as the tax rates vary among countries a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision additionally any change in the enacted tax rates any adverse outcome in connection with any income tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition results of operation or cash flows 

failure of our internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements providing reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to and cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our financial performance 

our international operations could form a larger portion of our business in future years future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many beyond our control these factors include political conditions economic conditions regulatory constraints currency regulations and exchange rates and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries laws and regulations of foreign governments and the united states such as the foreign corrupt practices act agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the united states risks inherent in international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations 

market expectations for our financial performance is high 

we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or share repurchase policies 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and backup systems could harm our business 

although we have independent redundant and primary and secondary computer systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes and errors by our employees if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investment to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in our computer systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations the costs potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or provide them in a delayed or more costly manner 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events could unfavorably affect our financial performance 

natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes particularly in california or in washington state where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located could unfavorably affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

from overseas delays in the delivery of goods to our depots or warehouses within a country in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses public health issues such as a potential h1n1 flu pandemic swine flu whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters 

any failure to comply with these laws could result in costs to satisfy environmental compliance remediation or compensatory requirements or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our operations 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may unfavorably affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits including grand jury investigations other government investigations consumer employment tort and other litigation see discussion of legal proceedings in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could unfavorably affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources our business requires compliance with a great variety of laws and regulations failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards fines and penalties 

we are subject to the risk of product liability claims 

if our merchandise offerings including food and prepared food products for human consumption drugs and childrens’ products do not meet applicable safely standards or our members’ expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk the sale of these items involves the risk of injury to our members such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects substances chemicals other agents or residues introduced during the growing manufacturing storage handling and transportation phases all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards while we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims lawsuits or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be long term 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

our success depends in part on the continued contributions of management and on our ability to attract train and retain highly qualified employees 

our success depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations merchandising and administrative personnel and the loss of any such persons could have a material adverse effect other than an annual agreement with our president and ceo mr sinegal we have no employment agreements with our officers we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified employees while controlling related labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition the company does not maintain key man insurance 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of memberrelated information we could damage our reputation with members incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

we receive retain and transmit certain personal information about our members in addition our online operations at wwwcostcocom and wwwcostcoca depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems or those of other business partners that results in our members’ personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

additionally the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the international federal and state levels privacy and information security laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach our reputation could be damaged possibly resulting in lost future business and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of noncompliance

part i 

item 1—business 

costco wholesale corporation and its subsidiaries “costco” or the “company” began operations in 1983 in seattle washington in october 1993 we merged with the price company which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept to form pricecostco inc a delaware corporation in january 1997 after the spinoff of most of our nonwarehouse assets to price enterprises inc we changed our name to costco companies inc on august 30 1999 we reincorporated from delaware to washington and changed our name to costco wholesale corporation our common stock trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “cost” 

general 

we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected privatelabel products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover this rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers mass merchandisers supermarkets and supercenters 

we buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a crossdocking consolidation point “depot” or directly to our warehouses our depots receive containerbased shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses generally in less than twentyfour hours this maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies lowering our receiving costs by eliminating many of the costs associated with multiplestep distribution channels such traditional steps include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers use of central receiving storing and distributing warehouses and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor 

because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover we generally have the opportunity to sell and be paid for inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors even though we take advantage of early payment discounts whenever available to us to the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital 

our typical warehouse format averages approximately 143000 square feet newer units tend to be larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices our warehouses need not have elaborate facilities by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format we have limited inventory losses shrinkage to less than twotenths of one percent of net sales in the last several fiscal years—well below those of typical discount retail operations 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

we generally limit marketing and promotional activities to new warehouse openings occasional direct mail to prospective new members and regular direct marketing programs such as the costco connection a magazine we publish for our members coupon mailers weekly email blasts from costcocom and handouts to existing members promoting selected merchandise these practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical retailers in connection with new warehouse openings our marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members these contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening potential gold star individual members are contacted by direct mail or by membership offerings distributed through employee associations and other entities after a membership base is established in an area most new memberships result from wordofmouth advertising followup messages distributed through employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective members 

our warehouses generally operate on a sevenday 69hour week open weekdays between 1000 am and 830 pm with earlier closing hours on the weekend gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers discount retailers and supermarkets and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking 

our merchandising strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere we seek to limit specific items in each product line to fastselling models sizes and colors therefore we carry an average of approximately 3800 active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business as opposed to 45000 to 140000 skus or more at discount retailers supermarkets and supercenters many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise on certain electronic items we have a 90day return policy in the united states canada and the united kingdom and provide free of charge technical support services as well as an extended warranty 

the following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by major category of items 

 

   

item 1—business continued 

  

ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently the following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal year end 

 

 costco mexico our 50owned joint venture operated 32 warehouses under our oversight at august 30 2009 the costco mexico warehouses are not included in the table above as costco mexico is accounted for using the equity method of accounting for investments 

our electronic commerce businesses costcocom in the us and costcoca in canada provide our members additional products generally not found in our warehouses in addition to services such as digital photo processing pharmacy travel and membership services 

our warehouses accept cash checks certain debit cards american express and a private label costco credit card losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from making payments at the point of sale until restitution is made 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brandname merchandise we do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business we also purchase selected private label merchandise as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to name brand items 

certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

we report on a 5253week fiscal year consisting of thirteen fourweek periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august the first three quarters consist of three periods each and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53week year there is no material seasonal impact on our operations except an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season references to 2009 2008 and 2007 relate to the 52week fiscal years ended august 30 2009 august 31 2008 and september 2 2007 respectively 

membership policy 

our membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue which allows us to offer lower prices members can utilize their memberships 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

at any costco warehouse location in any country we have two primary types of members business and gold star individual we continue to experience strong member renewal rates currently at 87 businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or other evidence of business existence may become business members business members generally pay an annual membership fee of 50 for the primary and spouse membership card with addon membership cards available for an annual fee of 40 including a free spouse card many of our business members also shop at costco for their personal needs individual memberships gold star memberships are available to individuals who do not qualify for a business membership for an annual fee of 50 which includes a spouse card

 these numbers exclude approximately 2800 2800 and 2700 cardholders of costco mexico at the end of 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

executive membership is available to all members in the us canada and united kingdom for an annual fee of approximately 100 the program offers additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services offered by costco such as merchant creditcard processing auto and home insurance business telephone service and check printing services the services are generally provided by thirdparties and vary by country and state in addition executive members qualify for a 2 annual reward which can be redeemed at costco warehouses up to a maximum of approximately 500 per year on all qualified purchases made at costco at the end of 2009 2008 and 2007 executive members represented 29 26 and 23 respectively of our primary membership base executive members spend more than other members and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase in 2008 costco mexico launched an executive membership program similar to the program in the us and canada

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection warehouse location and member service over 1200 warehouse club locations exist across the us and canada including our 483 north american warehouses and every major metropolitan area has several club operations in addition to other membership warehouse operators such as walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club we compete with a wide range of national and regional retailers and wholesalers including supermarkets supercenters general merchandise chains specialty chains gasoline stations as well as electronic commerce businesses such as amazon walmart target and kohl’s are significant general merchandise retail competitors we also compete with lowcost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such as lowe’s home depot office depot petsmart staples trader joe’s whole foods best buy and barnes  noble our international operations face similar competitors 

regulation 

certain state laws require that we apply minimum markups to our selling prices for specific goods such as tobacco products alcoholic beverages and gasoline while compliance with such laws may cause us to charge higher prices other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions and we believe that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on our operations 

certain states counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us within their jurisdictions we believe that if enacted such laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our operations 

intellectual property 

we believe that our trademarks trade names copyrights proprietary processes trade secrets patents trade dress and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important factors in our success we have invested significantly in the development and protection of our wellrecognized brands including costco wholesale and our premium private label brand kirkland signature ®  kirkland signature products are premium products offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for national brand products kirkland signature products allow us to ensure our quality standards are met while minimizing costs and differentiating our merchandise offerings from other retailers and we generally earn higher margins on sales of kirkland products we expect that our private label items will increase their share of our sales in the future we rely on trademark and copyright law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate

item 1a—risk factors 

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition andor results of operations these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by our forwardlooking statements those statements may relate to such matters as sales growth increases in comparable store sales impact of cannibalization price changes earnings performance earnings per share stockbased compensation expense warehouse openings and closures the effect of adopting certain accounting standards future financial reporting financing margins return on invested capital strategic direction expense control membership renewal rates shopping frequency litigation impact and the demand for our products and services you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this report there may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not presently perceive them to be material that could cause results to differ materially from our expectations forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these forwardlooking statements you are advised to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic filings with the sec 

we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators which could negatively affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for members employees warehouse sites products and services and in other important respects with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries we compete with other warehouse club operators discount retailers supermarkets supercenter stores retail and wholesale grocers department drug variety and specialty stores and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors as well as internetbased retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise pricing selection and availability services location convenience store hours and price our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could negatively affect our financial performance some competitors may have greater financial resources better access to merchandise andor greater market penetration than we do 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance 

higher interest rates energy costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs consumer debt levels unsettled financial markets weaknesses in housing and real estate markets reduced consumer confidence changes related to government fiscal and tax policies and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell prices of certain commodity products including gasoline and other food products are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins these factors can also increase our merchandise costs andor selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and results general economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

our growth strategy includes expanding our business both in existing markets and in new markets 

our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of constructing leasing and operating our warehouses we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively will affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses which may have a material adverse affect on our future growth and profitability 

we seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas a new warehouse may draw members away from our nearby existing warehouses and may adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses 

we also intend to open warehouses in new markets the risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us attracting members of other wholesale club operators currently operating in the new market our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence in new markets we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed as a result our future profitability may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our united states and canada operations 

our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our united states and canada operations which comprised 93 of consolidated net sales in 2009 and 2008 and 92 of operating income in 2009 and 2008 within the united states we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 27 of consolidated net sales in 2009 and 2008 our california market in general has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other markets as a result the operating income from our california operations is generally higher as a percentage of total operating income than other regions any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our united states operations particularly in california and our canada operations could arise from among other things failing to meet targets for warehouse openings declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor healthcare and energy costs cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets and failing consistently to provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members 

we depend on vendors to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices we have no assurances of continued supply pricing or access to new products and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us member demands may lead to outofstock positions of our merchandise leading to loss of sales and profits 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

we purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors 

our suppliers are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity inclement weather natural disasters supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise for these or other reasons one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control legal or regulatory standards these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members this failure could lead to litigation and recalls which could damage our reputation and our brands increase our costs and otherwise hurt our business 

in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods security and safety regulations trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control 

we depend on our depot operations to effectively and efficiently supply product to our warehouses 

we depend on the orderly operation of the receiving and distribution process primarily through our depots although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires hurricanes or other catastrophic events labor disagreements or shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly we may have excess inventory which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance this could have an adverse effect on margins and operating income 

our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our financial results 

damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales lower employee morale and productivity diminish member trust and reduce member renewal rates and accordingly membership fee revenues resulting in a reduction in shareholder value 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition sales returns reserves impairment of longlived assets and warehouse closing costs inventories selfinsurance income taxes unclaimed property laws and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance provisions for losses related to selfinsured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

changes in tax rates 

we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate as the tax rates vary among countries a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision additionally any change in the enacted tax rates any adverse outcome in connection with any income tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition results of operation or cash flows 

failure of our internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements providing reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to and cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our financial performance 

our international operations could form a larger portion of our business in future years future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many beyond our control these factors include political conditions economic conditions regulatory constraints currency regulations and exchange rates and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries laws and regulations of foreign governments and the united states such as the foreign corrupt practices act agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the united states risks inherent in international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations 

market expectations for our financial performance is high 

we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or share repurchase policies 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and backup systems could harm our business 

although we have independent redundant and primary and secondary computer systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes and errors by our employees if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investment to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in our computer systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations the costs potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or provide them in a delayed or more costly manner 

natural disasters or other catastrophic events could unfavorably affect our financial performance 

natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes particularly in california or in washington state where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located could unfavorably affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

from overseas delays in the delivery of goods to our depots or warehouses within a country in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses public health issues such as a potential h1n1 flu pandemic swine flu whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters 

any failure to comply with these laws could result in costs to satisfy environmental compliance remediation or compensatory requirements or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our operations 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may unfavorably affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits including grand jury investigations other government investigations consumer employment tort and other litigation see discussion of legal proceedings in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could unfavorably affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources our business requires compliance with a great variety of laws and regulations failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards fines and penalties 

we are subject to the risk of product liability claims 

if our merchandise offerings including food and prepared food products for human consumption drugs and childrens’ products do not meet applicable safely standards or our members’ expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk the sale of these items involves the risk of injury to our members such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects substances chemicals other agents or residues introduced during the growing manufacturing storage handling and transportation phases all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards while we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims lawsuits or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be long term 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

our success depends in part on the continued contributions of management and on our ability to attract train and retain highly qualified employees 

our success depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations merchandising and administrative personnel and the loss of any such persons could have a material adverse effect other than an annual agreement with our president and ceo mr sinegal we have no employment agreements with our officers we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified employees while controlling related labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition the company does not maintain key man insurance 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of memberrelated information we could damage our reputation with members incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

we receive retain and transmit certain personal information about our members in addition our online operations at wwwcostcocom and wwwcostcoca depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems or those of other business partners that results in our members’ personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

additionally the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the international federal and state levels privacy and information security laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach our reputation could be damaged possibly resulting in lost future business and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of noncompliance

 as previously reported 2007 was impacted by the following unusual items the effects of which are reflected in the table below 

 

  

  

  

   

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

we believe disclosing the effects of these items helps provide a meaningful comparison of our current year results to prior years the impact of each of these items noted above is presented below 

 

  

 results of operations 

net sales 

 

 2009 vs 2008 

net sales 

our 2009 sales results particularly in hardlines and softlines were negatively impacted by general economic conditions and we believe that those conditions may continue to have a significant adverse impact on spending by our members we believe however that due to the nature of our business model we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment 

net sales decreased 15 during 2009 compared to 2008 the 1088 decrease was comprised of a 2590 decrease in comparable sales partially offset by an increase of 1502 primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2009 and 2008 our sales were also impacted by a lower number of warehouse openings yearoveryear 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

foreign currencies particularly in canada the united kingdom and korea weakened against the us dollar which negatively impacted net sales during 2009 by approximately 2421 341 basis points net sales were also negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation during 2009 by approximately 2164 305 basis points which resulted from a 30 decline in the average sales price per gallon 

comparable sales 

comparable sales decreased 4 in 2009 weakening foreign currencies negatively impacted comparable sales by approximately 2339 333 basis points in 2009 gasoline price deflation negatively impacted comparable sales results by approximately 2113 298 basis points during 2009 comparable sales were negatively impacted by a decline in the average amount spent after adjustment for gasoline price deflation and measured in local currencies partially offset by an increase in shopping frequency reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations we believe the decline is a function of adverse economic conditions generally rather that a fundamental change in our members’ relationship to the company 

2008 vs 2007 

net sales increased 125 to 70977 in 2008 from 63088 in 2007 excluding the impact of the change in the estimated sales returns reserve in 2007 net sales as adjusted increased 7437 or 117 in 2008 as compared to the previous year the 7437 increase in adjusted net sales is comprised of 5153 from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and 2284 primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2008 and 2007 in the third quarter of 2007 we introduced a 90day return policy in the united states on certain electronic items 

significantly stronger foreign currencies particularly in canada positively impacted adjusted net sales by approximately 1134 or 180 basis points gasoline sales also contributed to the 7437 adjusted net sales growth by approximately 2236 with approximately 1489 related to the increase in gasoline sales prices additionally we experienced price increases in certain foods and fresh foods items that positively impacted net sales which were partially offset by price decreases in certain items within our hardlines category 

most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members with a smaller contribution from increases in shopping frequency gasoline sales positively impacted comparable warehouse sales growth by approximately 1938 comparable warehouse sales growth excluding gasoline would have been lower by approximately 267 basis points significantly stronger foreign currencies particularly in canada positively impacted comparable sales by approximately 1070 or 170 basis points reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations 

membership fees 

 

   

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

2009 vs 2008 

membership fees increased 18 in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to membership signups at the 15 new warehouses opened in 2009 19 opened two closed due to relocations and two closed costco home locations the continued benefit of membership signups at warehouses opened in 2008 and increased penetration of our higherfee executive membership program this increase was negatively impacted by a charge of 27 related to a proposed litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy and the weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar particularly in canada the united kingdom and korea which negatively impacted membership fees during 2009 by approximately 50 membership fees were also impacted by a lower number of warehouse openings yearoveryear our member renewal rate currently at 87 is consistent with recent years 

as previously disclosed effective with renewals occurring on and after march 1 2009 we changed an element of our membership renewal policy memberships renewed within two months after expiration of the current membership year are extended for twelve months from the expiration date under the previous policy renewals within six months of the expiration date were extended for twelve months from the expiration date memberships renewed more than two months after such expiration date are extended for twelve months from the renewal date although this change will have the effect of deferring recognition of certain membership fees paid by laterenewing members the effect is not expected to be material 

2008 vs 2007 

membership fees increased 147 to 1506 or 212 of net sales in 2008 from 1313 or 208 of net sales in 2007 excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in 2007 adjusted membership fees increased 100 from 2007 the increase was primarily due to new membership signups at the 24 new warehouses opened 34 opened and 10 closed due to relocations increased penetration of the higherfee executive membership program and the five dollar increase in our annual membership fee in the second half of 2006 for nonexecutive members our member renewal rate at the end of 2008 was 87 

gross margin 

 

 2009 vs 2008 

gross margin as a percent of net sales increased 28 basis points compared to 2008 this increase was primarily related to a net 18 basis point increase in our core merchandise departments primarily in food and sundries partially offset by a decrease in softlines and a net seven basis point increase from our warehouse ancillary businesses primarily our gasoline and pharmacy departments the majority of this gross margin improvement was due to our lower margin gas business having lower sales penetration due to the decline in the average selling price per gallon increased sales penetration of the executive membership twopercent reward program negatively affected gross margin by six basis 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

points in addition gross margin was favorably impacted by nine basis points due to reversing the 32 lifo reserve established in the prior year as we experienced net deflation yearoveryear in the cost of our merchandise inventories 

foreign currencies particularly in canada the united kingdom and korea weakened against the us dollar which negatively impacted gross margin for 2009 by approximately 258 

2008 vs 2007 

gross margin as a percent of net sales increased one basis point compared to 2007 excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in 2007 adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales decreased five basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007 this decrease was largely due to a net 12 basis point decrease in our warehouse ancillary businesses particularly in onehour photo tire shop and food services partially offset by an increase in our gasoline business a 32 or five basis point lifo charge resulting from price increases in certain food items and gasoline and a three basis point decrease resulting from the increased penetration of the executive membership twopercent reward program and increased spending by executive members these decreases were partially offset by a net 15 basis point increase from our merchandise departments particularly fresh foods food and sundries costco online and our international operations partially offset by a decrease in softlines

sga expenses as a percent of net sales increased 58 basis points compared to 2008 increased warehouse operating and central administrative costs as a percent of net sales negatively impacted sga by approximately 56 basis points resulting primarily from lower sales levels and higher employee health care costs higher stockbased compensation expense had a negative impact of one basis point in addition we recorded an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts which negatively impacted sga as a percent of net sales by two basis points the net realizable value of the insurance contracts is largely based on changes in investment assets underlying the policies and is subject to conditions generally affecting equity and debt markets in 2008 we recorded a 16 reserve in connection with a legal settlement which positively impacted the comparison to current year’s sga expense as a percent of net sales by two basis points 

sga expenses as a percent of net sales for 2009 were adversely impacted by the decrease in the price of gasoline as it produced a decline in sales dollars without a comparative reduction in labor or other administrative costs foreign currencies particularly in canada the united kingdom and korea weakened against the us dollar which positively impacted sga for 2009 by approximately 217

2008 vs 2007 

sga expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 14 basis points compared to 2007 excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and sga expenses in 2007 adjusted sga as a percentage of adjusted net sales was comparable to 2007 warehouse operating and central administrative costs positively impacted adjusted sga comparisons on a net basis by approximately seven basis points primarily due to decreased payroll and benefits costs as a percent of adjusted net sales stockbased compensation expense negatively impacted adjusted sga comparisons by three basis points primarily due to a higher closing stock price on the date that our october 2007 rsu grant was valued as compared to previous grants additionally in 2008 we recorded a 16 reserve in connection with a litigation settlement and accrued approximately 9 for compensation adjustments we made to employees enrolled in our medical and dental plans related to a decision to share a portion of the health plan’s savings that we achieved these two items negatively impacted adjusted sga comparisons by four basis points 

preopening expenses 

 

 preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses preopening expenses can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our yearend whether the warehouse is owned or leased whether the opening is in an existing new or international market the decline in 2009 is primarily attributable to fewer warehouse openings 

provision for impaired assets and closing costs net 

 

 this provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of longlived assets future lease obligations of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities accelerated depreciation based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property largely comprised of former warehouse locations 

2009 vs 2008 

the net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was a 17 in 2009 compared to a nominal amount in 2008 the provision in 2009 included charges of 9 for warehouse closing expenses and impairment charges of 8 primarily related to the closing of our two costco home locations in july 2009

at the end of both 2009 and 2008 the reserve for warehouse closing costs was 5 and primarily related to future lease obligations 

interest expense 

 

 2009 vs 2008 

interest expense primarily relates to our 900 of 53 and 1100 of 55 senior notes 2007 senior notes issued in 2007 the increase in interest expense is primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest related to reduced new warehouse and remodel construction activity yearoveryear 

2008 vs 2007 

the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our 2007 senior notes in february 2007 partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment in march 2007 of the 300 55 senior notes 

interest income and other 

 

 2009 vs 2008 

the decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates yearoveryear on our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances resulting from a change in policy to invest primarily in us government and agency securities which earn a lower interest rate in addition we recognized 12 of otherthantemporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009 compared to an impairment loss of 5 in 2008 see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources the decrease in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in costco mexico a 50owned joint venture costco mexico’s earnings were lower in 2009 primarily due to the peso weakening against the us dollar the decrease in minority interest and other is primarily due to a negative 5 marktomarket charge in 2009 compared to a 6 gain in 2008 related to our forward foreign exchange contracts see the derivatives section for more information

2008 vs 2007 

the decrease in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates yearoveryear on our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances in addition we recognized 5 of otherthantemporary impairment losses on certain securities within our investment portfolio the increase in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our investment in costco mexico a 50owned joint venture 

provision for income taxes 

 

 the lower tax rate in 2008 was primarily attributable to discrete benefits recognized during the year 

net income 

 

 2009 vs 2008 

net income for 2009 decreased to 1086 or 247 per diluted share from 1283 or 289 per diluted share during 2008 representing a 15 decrease in diluted net income per share as previously discussed foreign currencies particularly in canada the united kingdom and korea weakened against the us dollar which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately 83 aftertax or 019 per diluted share additionally net income for 2009 was negatively impacted by a 34 pretax charge or approximately 005 per diluted share related to a proposed litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy as well as a 23 pretax charge or approximately 003 per diluted share for an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts net income for 2009 was positively impacted by a 32 pretax or 005 per diluted share benefit due to the reversal of the lifo reserve established in 2008 

2008 vs 2007 

net income for 2008 increased to 1283 or 289 per diluted share from 1083 or 237 per diluted share during 2007 the unusual items previously discussed totaled 119 net of tax or 026 per diluted share in 2007 exclusive of these items earnings in 2007 were 263 per diluted share net income per diluted share in 2008 represents an increase of 10 over this adjusted amount during 2008 we repurchased and retired 13812000 shares of common stock favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately 003

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets at the end of 2009 and 2008 dollars in millions except per share data 

 

 our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances which were 3727 and 3275 at the end of 2009 and 2008 respectively of these balances approximately 758 and 788 at the end of 2009 and 2008 respectively represented debit and credit card receivables primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of the fiscal year 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 2092 in 2009 compared to 2206 in 2008 a decrease of approximately 114 this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income of 197 partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation of 90 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1101 in 2009 compared to 1717 in 2008 a decrease of approximately 616 the decrease in investing activities relates primarily to a 349 decrease in cash used for additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects and a prior year reclassification of 371 of cash and cash equivalents to shortterm investments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets explained further below these activities were partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by the net investment in shortterm investments of 62 as a result of less cash needed to fund our common stock repurchase activity as well as a decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 41 

in 2008 one of our enhanced money fund investments columbia strategic cash portfolio fund columbia ceased accepting cash redemption requests and changed to a floating net asset value in light of the restricted liquidity we elected to receive a prorata allocation of the underlying securities in a separately managed account we assessed the fair value of these securities through market quotations and review of current investment ratings as available coupled with an evaluation of the liquidation value of each investment and its current performance in meeting scheduled payments of principal and interest during 2009 and 2008 we recognized 12 and 5 respectively of otherthantemporary impairment losses related to these securities the losses are included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income at august 30 2009 and august 31 2008 the balance of the columbia fund was 27 and 104 respectively on the consolidated balance sheets 

in 2008 two other enhanced money fund investments blackrock cash strategies llc blackrock and merrill lynch capital reserve fund llc merrill lynch ceased accepting redemption requests and commenced liquidation as of august 31 2008 the balance of the blackrock and merrill lynch funds was 82 and 43 respectively on the consolidated balance sheets during 2009 the remaining balances of these funds were liquidated 

during 2008 we reclassified 371 of these three funds from cash and cash equivalents to shortterm investments and other assets at august 30 2009 24 remained in shortterm investments and 3 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

remained in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets reflecting the timing of the expected distributions at august 31 2008 161 was in shortterm investments and 68 in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

the markets relating to these investments remain uncertain and there may be further declines in the value of these investments that may cause additional losses in future periods 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 439 in 2009 compared to 643 in 2008 the 204 decrease in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from a reduction in the cash used to repurchase common stock of 826 partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from stockbased awards and the excess tax benefit on sharebased awards of 276 a decrease in the net proceeds from shortterm borrowings of 195 as well as a decrease in the cash provided by the issuance of longterm debt of 103 

the effect of exchange rate changes reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows decreased cash by 14 in 2009 compared to a decrease of 7 in 2008 this increase was due primarily to the significant weakening of the canadian korean and the united kingdom currencies as compared to the us dollar during 2009 

dividends 

in april 2009 our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from 016 to 018 per share or 072 on an annualized basis our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2009 totaled 068 per share in 2008 we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling 061 per share

 expansion plans 

our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses capital is also required for initial warehouse operations and working capital while there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review it is our current intention to spend approximately 1300 during fiscal 2010 for real estate construction remodeling and equipment for warehouses and related operations these expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

we plan to open approximately 16 to 18 new warehouses in 2010 including one to two relocations of existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities 

additional equity investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures 

our investments in the costco mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method we did not make any capital contributions to our investment in costco mexico a 50owned joint venture in 2009 2008 or 2007

19 and 42 in 2009 and 2007 respectively after factoring in the related debt discount in 2008 the conversion of principle for zero coupon notes after factoring the related debt discount was not significant 

derivatives 

effective november 24 2008 we adopted the disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities—an amendment of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 133” sfas 161 we follow sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended” sfas 133 in accounting for derivative and hedging activities 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchangerate fluctuations in the normal course of our business which we manage in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency the forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to hedge us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures currently these instruments do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting we use these instruments to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions these contracts do not contain any creditriskrelated contingent features 

we seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with these forward foreign exchange contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships there can be no assurance however that this effectively mitigates counterparty risk in addition the contracts are limited to a time period of less than one year see note 1 and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information related to these contracts 

we are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in energy prices particularly electricity and natural gas which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixedprice contracts with counterparties for approximately 24 of our warehouses and other facilities in the us and canada we also enter into variablepriced contracts for some purchases of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis these contracts qualify for treatment as “normal purchase or normal sales” under sfas 133 and require no marktomarket adjustment 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

with the exception of our operating leases we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements 

stock repurchase programs 

in september and november of 2007 our board of directors approved 300 and 1000 respectively of stock repurchases which expire in august 2010 and november 2010 respectively in july 2008 our board of directors approved an additional 1000 which expires in july 2011 bringing total authorizations by our board of directors since inception of the program in 2001 to 6800 

during 2009 we repurchased 895000 shares at an average price of 6384 per share totaling approximately 57 during 2008 we repurchased 13812000 shares of common stock at an average price of 6422 per share totaling approximately 887 the remaining amount available to be purchased under 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

our approved plan was 2002 at the end of 2009 purchases are made from timetotime as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under sec rule 10b51 repurchased shares are retired in accordance with the washington business corporation act 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments we continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition investments merchandise inventory valuation impairment of longlived assets warehouse closing costs insuranceselfinsurance liabilities and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 

revenue recognition 

we generally recognize sales net of estimated returns at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns amounts collected from members which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis 

we evaluate the criteria of the fasb emerging issues task force eitf 9919 “reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent” in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when we are the primary obligor subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers influence product or service specifications or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded on a gross basis if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above we record the net amounts as commissions earned which is reflected in net sales 

membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members we account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the oneyear membership period 

our executive members qualify for a 2 reward which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses up to a maximum of 500 per year on all qualified purchases made at costco we account for this 2 reward as a reduction in sales with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of nonredemptions based on historical data 

investments 

investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor issuer conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

merchandise inventories 

merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the lastin firstout lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the firstin firstout fifo method we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues we record an adjustment each quarter if necessary for the expected annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at yearend at the end of 2008 due to overall net inflationary trends merchandise inventories valued at lifo were lower than the fifo value resulting in a 32 charge to merchandise costs during 2009 due to overall deflationary trends we recorded a 32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at lifo at the end of 2009 and 2007 merchandise inventories valued at lifo approximated fifo after considering the lower of cost or market principle 

we provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year 

inventory cost where appropriate is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones terms of agreement or other systematic and rational approaches 

impairment of longlived assets and warehouse closing costs 

we periodically evaluate our longlived assets for indicators of impairment such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their thencurrent fair market value 

we provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated a considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations these estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets we make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location we reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change 

insuranceself insurance liabilities 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including a whollyowned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool to provide for potential liabilities for workers’ compensation general liability property damage director and officers’ liability vehicle liability and 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data continued 

  

employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

income taxes 

we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items at the beginning of 2008 the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge if any from tax authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see discussion of recent accounting pronouncements in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 




 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes the current condition of the financial markets however has rendered identifiable risks less predictable and liquidity concerns and credit risks have increased 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified amongst money market funds debt securities corporate notes and bonds and enhanced money funds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields a revised investment policy was approved in december 2007 by our board of directors limiting future investments to direct us government and government agency obligations repurchase agreements collateralized by us government and government agency obligations and us government and government agency money market funds 

the investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal while continuing to generate yields our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in us government and government agency obligations corporate notes and bonds and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of aa 

all of our foreign subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds investment grade securities bankers’ acceptances bank certificates of deposit and term deposits all denominated in their local currencies additionally our canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in us dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current us dollar obligations 

  

item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued 

  

all of the investment policies of the company and subsidiaries are reviewed at least annually 

because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are of a shortterm nature if interest rates were to increase or decrease the impact would likely be immaterial to our financial statements based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2009 and 2008 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately 24 and 18 pretax respectively to interest income on an annual basis for those investments that are classified as availableforsale the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 

the nature and amount of our long and shortterm debt may vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors as of the end of 2009 our fixedrate longterm debt included 42 principal amount at maturity of 35 zero coupon convertible subordinated notes carried at 32 900 of 53 senior notes carried at 899 and 1100 of 55 senior notes carried at 1096 and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling 228 additionally our variable rate longterm debt included a 035 over yen tibor 6month term loan of 32 fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixedrate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for more information on our long and shortterm debt 

foreign currencyexchange risk 

our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their nonfunctional currencies which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we manage these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency 

as of august 30 2009 and august 31 2008 we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of 183 and 90 respectively and a fair value liability of 2 and a fair value asset of 5 respectively on the consolidated balance sheets a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the functional currency compared to the nonfunctional currency exchange rates at august 30 2009 and august 31 2008 would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by 18 and 10 respectively

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of august 30 2009 using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework based on its assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of august 30 2009

 item 1—business 

costco wholesale corporation and its subsidiaries “costco” or the “company” began operations in 1983 in seattle washington in october 1993 we merged with the price company which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept to form pricecostco inc a delaware corporation in january 1997 after the spinoff of most of our nonwarehouse assets to price enterprises inc we changed our name to costco companies inc on august 30 1999 we reincorporated from delaware to washington and changed our name to costco wholesale corporation our common stock trades on the nasdaq under the symbol “cost” 

general 

we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected privatelabel products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover this rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers mass merchandisers supermarkets and supercenters 

we buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a crossdocking consolidation point “depot” or directly to our warehouses our depots receive containerbased shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses generally in less than twentyfour hours this maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies lowering our receiving costs by eliminating many of the costs associated with multiple step distribution channels such traditional steps include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers use of central receiving storing and distributing warehouses and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor 

because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover we generally have the opportunity to sell and be paid for inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors even though we take advantage of early payment discounts whenever available to us as sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital 

our typical warehouse format averages approximately 142000 square feet newer units tend to be larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices our warehouses need not have elaborate facilities by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format we have limited inventory losses shrinkage to less than twotenths of one percent of net sales in the last several fiscal years—well below those of typical discount retail operations 

we generally limit marketing and promotional activities to new warehouse openings occasional direct mail to prospective new members and regular direct marketing programs such as the costco connection a magazine we publish for our members coupon mailers and handouts to existing members promoting selected merchandise these practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical retailers in connection with new warehouse openings our marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members these contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening potential gold star individual members are 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

contacted by direct mail or by membership offerings distributed through employee associations and other entities after a membership base is established in an area most new memberships result from wordofmouth advertising followup messages distributed through employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective members 

our warehouses generally operate on a sevenday 69hour week open weekdays between 1000 am and 830 pm with earlier closing hours on the weekend gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers discount retailers and supermarkets and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking 

our merchandising strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere it is important to carry only those products on which we can provide our members significant savings we seek to limit specific items in each product line to fastselling models sizes and colors therefore we carry an average of approximately 4000 active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business as opposed to 40000 to 140000 skus or more at discount retailers supermarkets and supercenters many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise in fiscal 2007 we introduced a 90day return policy in the united states on certain electronic items in fiscal 2008 the program was expanded to canada and the united kingdom additionally we provide free of charge technical support services as well as an extended warranty on certain electronic items 

the following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by major category of items 

 

   

item 1—business continued 

  

ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently the following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal year end 

 

 costco mexico our 50owned joint venture operated 31 warehouses under our oversight at august 31 2008 the costco mexico warehouses are not included in the table above as costco mexico is not consolidated and is accounted for using the equity method of accounting for investments 

our electronic commerce businesses costcocom in the us and costcoca in canada provide our members additional products generally not found in our warehouses in addition to services such as digital photo processing pharmacy travel and membership services 

our warehouses accept cash checks certain debit cards american express and a private label costco credit card losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from making payments at the point of sale until restitution is made 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise no significant portion of merchandise is obtained from any one of these or any other single supplier we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of our business we also purchase selected private label merchandise as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to name brand items 

financial information of our segments and geographic areas is included in note 12 segment reporting to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

we report on a 5253week fiscal year consisting of thirteen fourweek periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august the first three quarters consist of three periods each and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53week year there is no material seasonal impact on our operations except an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season references to 2008 and 2007 relate to the 52week fiscal years ended august 31 2008 and september 2 2007 respectively references to 2006 relate to the 53week fiscal year ended september 3 2006 

membership policy 

our membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue which allows us to offer lower prices 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

members can utilize their memberships at any costco warehouse location in any country we have two primary types of members business and gold star individual we continue to experience strong member renewal rates currently at 87 businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or other evidence of business existence may become business members business members generally pay an annual membership fee of 50 for the primary and spouse membership card with addon membership cards available for an annual fee of 40 including a free spouse card a significant number of our business members also shop at costco for their personal needs 

individual memberships gold star memberships are available to individuals who do not qualify for a business membership for an annual fee of 50 which includes a spouse card 

our membership base was made up of the following in thousands 

 

 these numbers exclude approximately 2800 2700 and 2600 cardholders of costco mexico at the end of 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

executive membership is available to all members in the us and canada for an annual fee of 100 the executive membership program offers members additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services offered by costco such as merchant creditcard processing auto and home insurance business telephone service check printing and real estate and mortgage services the services are generally provided by thirdparties and vary by state in addition executive members qualify for a 2 annual reward which can be redeemed at costco warehouses up to a maximum of 500 per year on all qualified purchases made at costco at the end of 2008 2007 and 2006 executive members represented 26 23 and 20 respectively of our primary membership base and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase in 2008 costco mexico launched an executive membership program similar to the program in the us and canada 

labor 

our employee count approximated 

 

 these numbers exclude approximately 9000 individuals who were employed by costco mexico at the end of 2008 and 2007 and approximately 8000 at the end of 2006 approximately 14000 hourly employees in certain of our locations all former price company locations in five states are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters all remaining employees are nonunion we consider our employee relations to be very good

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection warehouse location and member service over 1200 warehouse club locations exist across the us and canada including our 473 north american warehouses and every major metropolitan area has one if not several club operations in addition to other membership warehouse operators such as walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club we compete with a wide range of national and regional retailers and wholesalers including supermarkets supercenters general merchandise chains specialty chains gasoline stations as well as electronic commerce businesses walmart target and kohl’s are significant general merchandise retail competitors we also compete with lowcost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such as lowe’s home depot office depot petsmart staples trader joe’s whole foods best buy and barnes  noble our international operations face similar competitors 

regulation 

certain state laws require that we apply minimum markups to our selling prices for specific goods such as tobacco products alcoholic beverages and gasoline while compliance with such laws may cause us to charge somewhat higher prices other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions and we believe that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on our operations 

it is our policy to sell at lower than manufacturers’ suggested retail prices some manufacturers attempt to maintain the resale price of their products by refusing to sell to us or to other purchasers that do not adhere to suggested retail prices or that otherwise sell at discounted prices to date we believe that we have not been materially affected by our inability to purchase directly from such manufacturers both federal and state legislation is proposed from time to time which if enacted would restrict our ability to purchase goods or extend the application of laws enabling the establishment of minimum prices we cannot predict the effect on our business of the enactment of such legislation 

certain states counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us within their jurisdictions we believe that if enacted such laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our operations 

available information 

we maintain an internet website at wwwcostcocom we make available through the investor relations section of our website free of charge our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k proxy statements and forms 3 4 and 5 and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with or furnishing such documents to the securities and exchange commission sec the information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the sec

 item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition andor results of operations these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by our forwardlooking statements those statements may relate to such matters as sales growth increases in comparable store sales impact of cannibalization price changes earnings performance earnings per share stock–based compensation expense warehouse openings and closures the effect of adopting certain accounting standards future financial reporting financing margins return on invested capital strategic direction expense control membership renewal rates shopping frequency litigation impact and the demand for our products and services you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this report there may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not presently perceive them to be material that could cause results to differ materially from our expectations forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these forwardlooking statements you are advised however to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic filings with the sec 

we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators which could negatively affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for members employees warehouse sites products and services and in other important respects with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries we compete with other warehouse club operators discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors as well as electronic commerce retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercenter stores warehouse clubs internetbased retailers and catalog businesses such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise pricing selection and availability services offered to members location store hours and price our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could negatively affect our financial performance some competitors may have greater financial resources better access to merchandise andor greater market penetration than we do 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance 

higher interest rates energy costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs consumer debt levels unsettled financial markets and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell prices of certain commodity products including gasoline and other food products are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins these factors can also increase our merchandise costs andor selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and results general economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

our growth strategy includes expanding our business both in existing markets and in new markets 

our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to build or lease new warehouses we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of constructing leasing and operating our warehouses we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively will affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses which may have a material adverse affect on our future growth and profitability 

we seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas a new warehouse may draw members away from our nearby existing warehouses and may adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses 

we also intend to open warehouses in new markets the risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence while we have a track record of profitable growth in new markets we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed as a result our future profitability may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our united states and canada operations 

our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our united states and canada operations which comprised 93 and 94 of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively and 92 and 93 of operating income in 2008 and 2007 respectively within the united states we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 27 and 28 of consolidated net sales in 2008 and 2007 respectively our california market in general has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other markets as a result the operating income from our california operations is generally higher as a percentage of total operating income than other regions any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our united states operations particularly in california and our canada operations could arise from among other things failing to meet targets for warehouse openings declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor healthcare and energy costs cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets and failing consistently to provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members 

we depend on vendors to timely supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices we have no assurances of continued supply pricing or access to new products and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us member demands may lead to insufficient instock positions of our merchandise leading to loss of sales 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

we purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors 

our suppliers are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity inclement weather natural disasters supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise for these or other reasons one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control legal or regulatory standards these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members this failure could lead to litigation and recalls which could damage our reputation and our brands increase our costs and otherwise hurt our business 

in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods security and safety regulations trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control 

we depend on our depot operations to effectively and efficiently supply product to our warehouses 

we depend on the orderly operation of the receiving and distribution process primarily through our depots although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires hurricanes or other catastrophic events labor disagreements or shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly we may have excess inventory which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance this could have an adverse effect on margins and operating income 

our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our financial results 

damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales lower employee morale and productivity and diminish member trust resulting in a reduction in shareholder value 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including but not limited to revenue recognition sales returns reserves impairment of longlived assets and warehouse closing costs inventories selfinsurance income taxes unclaimed property laws and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 

failure of our internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements providing reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our financial performance 

our international operations could form a larger portion of our business in future years future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many beyond our control these factors include political conditions economic conditions regulatory constraints currency regulations and exchange rates and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries laws and regulations of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the united states risks inherent in international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations 

market expectations for our financial performance is high 

we believe that the price of our stock reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet these expectations including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates earn 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

ings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary backup systems could harm our ability to run our business 

although we have independent redundant and primary and secondary computer systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our businesscritical computer systems our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses internal or external security breaches catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes andor errors by our employees if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make significant investment to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both of our computer systems and backup systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

natural disasters could unfavorably affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes particularly in california or in washington state where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located could unfavorably affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas delays in the delivery of goods to our depots or warehouses within a country in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters 

any failure to comply with these laws could result in costs to satisfy environmental compliance remediation or compensatory requirements or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our operations 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may unfavorably affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits including grand jury investigations other government investigations consumer employment tort and other litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could unfavorably affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources our business requires compliance with a great variety of laws and regulations failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards fines and penalties 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

we are subject to the risk of product liability claims including claims concerning food and prepared food products 

the sale of food and prepared food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to our members such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties product contamination or spoilage including the presence of foreign objects substances chemicals other agents or residues introduced during the growing storage handling and transportation phases while we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image 

our success depends in part on the continued contributions of management and on our ability to attract train and retain highly qualified employees 

our success depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations merchandising and administrative personnel and the loss of any such persons could have a material adverse effect other than an annual agreement with our president and ceo mr sinegal we have no employment agreements with our officers we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified employees while controlling related labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition the company does not maintain key man insurance 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of memberrelated information we could damage our reputation with members incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

we receive and retain certain personal information about our members in addition our online operations at wwwcostcocom and wwwcostcoca depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems or those of other business partners that results in our member’s personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

additionally the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the international federal and state levels privacy and information security laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach our reputation could be damaged possibly resulting in lost future business and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of noncompliance

net sales increased 125 to 7098 billion in 2008 from 6309 billion in 2007 excluding the impact of the change in the estimated sales returns reserve in 2007 net sales as adjusted increased 744 billion or 117 in 2008 as compared to the previous year the 744 billion increase in adjusted net sales is comprised of 515 billion from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and 229 billion primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2008 and 2007 

significantly stronger foreign currencies particularly in canada positively impacted adjusted net sales by approximately 113 billion or 180 basis points gasoline sales also contributed to the 744 billion adjusted net sales growth by approximately 224 billion with approximately 149 billion related to the increase in gasoline sales prices additionally we experienced price increases in certain foods and fresh foods items that positively impacted net sales which were partially offset by price decreases in certain items within our hardlines category 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members with a smaller contribution from increases in shopping frequency gasoline sales positively impacted comparable warehouse sales growth by approximately 194 billion comparable warehouse sales growth excluding gasoline would have been lower by approximately 267 basis points significantly stronger foreign currencies particularly in canada positively impacted comparable sales by approximately 107 billion or 170 basis points reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations 

while overall sales in 2008 were not materially affected by general economic conditions we believe that those conditions have constrained and will continue to constrain the growth of spending by our members on hardlines and softlines relative to food and sundries in addition risks related to general economic conditions including those arising from price increases due to rising fuel and commodity costs and other factors will continue to impact overall consumer spending although due to the nature of our business model we believe we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment 

2007 vs 2006 

net sales increased by 413 billion or 70 to 6309 billion in 2007 a 52week year from 5896 billion in 2006 a 53week year the 413 billion increase in net sales is comprised of 210 billion from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and 203 billion primarily from sales at new warehouses opened during 2007 and 2006 partially offset by the change in the reserve for estimated sales returns 

changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increase gasoline sales contributed to the 413 billion net sales growth by approximately 3561 million with approximately 178 million related to the increase in gasoline sales prices 

most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members with a smaller contribution from increases in shopping frequency gasoline sales did not have a material impact on comparable warehouse sales growth significantly stronger foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately 4184 million or 72 basis points reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations 

in the fourth quarter of 2007 the decrease in our estimated sales returns reserve resulted in an increase to net sales of 579 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 where our reserve was increased resulting in a decrease to net sales of 331 million this improvement is primarily a result of the changes to our consumer electronics returns policy implemented in the spring of 2007

derivatives 

we follow statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended” sfas 133 in accounting for derivative and hedging activities we use derivative and hedging arrangements only to manage what we believe to be welldefined risks forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms these forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting the aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of 2008 and 2007 was 898 million and 750 million respectively the marktomarket adjustment related to these contracts resulted in the recording of an asset of 46 million and a liability of 09 million at the end of 2008 and 2007 respectively and 58 million and 04 million were recognized in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income in 2008 and 2007 respectively the majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our whollyowned united kingdom subsidiary primarily to hedge us dollar merchandise inventory purchases

we are exposed to risks in energy costs due to fluctuations in energy prices particularly electricity which we partially mitigate through the use of fixedprice contracts with counterparties for approximately 19 of our warehouses in the us and canada as well as certain depots and other facilities we have also entered into variablepriced contracts for the purchase of natural gas and fuel for our gas stations on an index basis these contracts qualify for treatment as “normal purchase or normal sales” under sfas 133 and require no marktomarket adjustment 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

with the exception of our operating leases we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments we continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition merchandise inventory valuation impairment of longlived assets warehouse closing costs insuranceselfinsurance liabilities investments and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 

revenue recognition 

we generally recognize sales net of estimated returns at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels amounts collected from members which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis 

we evaluate the criteria of the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf 9919 “reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent” in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when we are the primary obligor subject to inventory risk 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers influence product or service specifications or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded on a gross basis if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above we record the net amounts as commissions earned which is reflected in net sales 

membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members we account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the oneyear membership period in 2007 we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each member’s specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method which was based on the period in which the fee was collected this review resulted in a 562 million reduction to membership fee revenue in 2007 and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet this adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors 

our executive members qualify for a 2 reward which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses up to a maximum of 500 per year on all qualified purchases made at costco we account for this 2 reward as a reduction in sales with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of nonredemptions based on historical data 

merchandise inventories 

merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the lastin firstout lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories merchandise inventories for all other foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method of accounting and are stated using the firstin firstout fifo method we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues we record an adjustment each quarter if necessary for the expected annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at yearend the lifo inventory adjustment in 2008 reduced ending inventory and gross margin by 323 million at the end of 2007 merchandise inventories valued at lifo approximated fifo after considering the lower of cost or market principle 

we provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year 

inventory cost where appropriate is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones terms of agreement or other systematic and rational approaches 

impairment of longlived assets and warehouse closing costs 

we periodically evaluate our longlived assets for indicators of impairment such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their thencurrent fair market value 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

we provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated a considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations these estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets we make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location we reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change 

insuranceself insurance liabilities 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including a whollyowned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool to provide for potential liabilities for workers’ compensation general liability property damage director and officers’ liability vehicle liability and employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

investments 

investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor issuer conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

income taxes 

we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 which sets out criteria for the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items at the beginning of 2008 the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge if any from tax authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas 157 which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fairvalue measurements required under other accounting pronouncements it does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value sfas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1571 fsp fas 1571 which excludes sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” and certain other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under sfas 13 from the scope of sfas 157 in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no 1572 fsp 1572 which provides a oneyear delayed application of sfas 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually we are required to adopt sfas 157 as amended by fsp fas 1571 and fsp fas 1572 on september 1 2008 the beginning of our fiscal 2009 the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in october 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1573 “determining the fair value of a financial asset in a market that is not active” fsp 1573 which clarifies the application of sfas 157 when the market for a financial asset is inactive specifically fsp 1573 clarifies how 1 management’s internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present 2 observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account and 3 the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value the guidance in fsp 1573 is effective immediately and will apply to us upon adoption of sfas 157 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment to fasb no 115” sfas 159 under sfas 159 entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contractbycontract basis with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period the election called the fair value option will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply more complex hedge accounting provisions sfas 159 will be effective for us september 1 2008 the beginning of our fiscal 2009 we do not intend to elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial assets or financial liabilities therefore this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2008 the fasb issued staff position eitf 03061 “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” fsp eitf 03061 fsp eitf 03061 provides that unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the twoclass method in sfas no 128 “earnings per share” our unvested rsus are not eligible to receive dividends therefore eitf 03061 will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 51” sfas 160 sfas 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent changes in a parent’s ownership of a noncontrolling interest calculation and disclosure of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest and fair value measurement of any retained noncontrolling equity investment sfas 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is prohibited we must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” sfas 141r which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree sfas 141r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years we must adopt these new requirements in our first quarter of fiscal 2010 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities—an amendment of fasb statement no 133” sfas 161 which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities this statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after november 15 2008 early adoption is permitted we must provide these new disclosures no later than our second quarter of fiscal 2009 

we are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of sfas nos 141r 160 and 161 will have on our future consolidated financial statements

 item 1—business 

costco wholesale corporation “costco” or the “company” began operations in 1983 in seattle washington in october 1993 we merged with the price company which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept to form pricecostco inc a delaware corporation in january 1997 after the spinoff of most of our nonwarehouse assets to price enterprises inc we changed our name to costco companies inc on august 30 1999 we reincorporated from delaware to washington and changed our name to costco wholesale corporation our common stock trades on the nasdaq under the symbol “cost” 

general 

we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected privatelabel products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover this rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers mass merchandisers supermarkets and supercenters 

we buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a crossdocking consolidation point “depot” or directly to our warehouses our depots receive containerbased shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses generally in less than twentyfour hours this maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies thereby lowering our receiving costs by eliminating many of the costs associated with multiple step distribution channels which include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers use of central receiving storing and distributing warehouses and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor 

because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover we generally have the opportunity to sell and be paid for inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors even though we take advantage of early payment discounts whenever available to us as sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by vendors rather than by our working capital 

our typical warehouse format averages approximately 140000 square feet newer units tend to be larger floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices our warehouses need not have elaborate facilities by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format we have limited inventory losses to less than twotenths of one percent of net sales in each of the last three fiscal years—well below those of typical discount retail operations 

we generally limit marketing and promotional activities to new warehouse openings occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and regular direct marketing programs such as the costco connection a magazine we publish for our members and coupon mailers to existing members promoting selected merchandise these practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical retailers in connection with new warehouse openings our marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members these contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening potential gold star individual members 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

are contacted by direct mail or by providing membership offerings to be distributed through employee associations and other entities after a membership base is established in an area most new memberships result from wordofmouth advertising followup messages distributed through regular payroll or other organizational communications to employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective business and gold star members 

our warehouses generally operate on a sevenday 69hour week generally warehouses are open weekdays between 1000 am and 830 pm with earlier closing hours on the weekend gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers discount retailers and supermarkets and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking 

our merchandising strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than could be obtained elsewhere an important element of this strategy is to carry only those products on which we can provide our members significant savings we seek to limit specific items in each product line to fastselling models sizes and colors therefore we carry an average of approximately 4000 active stockkeeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business as opposed to discount retailers and supermarkets that normally stock 40000 skus or more many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only 

in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise in fiscal 2007 we introduced a 90day return policy in the united states on certain electronic items additionally we now provide free of charge technical support service as well as an extended warranty on certain electronic items 

the following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by major category of items 

 

   

item 1—business continued 

  

ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently the following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal year end 

 

 warehouses operated by our mexico joint venture are not included above at september 2 2007 our 50 owned joint venture in mexico operated 30 warehouses 

our electronic commerce businesses costcocom in the us and costcoca in canada provide our members additional products generally not found in our warehouses in addition to services such as digital photo processing pharmacy travel and membership services 

our warehouses accept cash checks certain debit cards american express and a private label costco credit card losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from cashing checks at the point of sale until restitution is made 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise no significant portion of merchandise is obtained from any one of these or any other single supplier we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of our business we also purchase selected private label merchandise as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater 

financial information of our segments and geographic areas is included in note 12 segment reporting to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

we report on a 5253week fiscal year consisting of thirteen fourweek periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august the first second and third quarters consist of three periods each and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53week year there is no material seasonal impact on our operations except an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season fiscal years 2007 and 2005 each consisted of 52 weeks and fiscal year 2006 was a 53week year 

membership policy 

our membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue which allows us to offer low prices 

members can utilize their memberships at any costco warehouse location in any country we have two primary types of members business and gold star individual in addition us and canadian 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

members can upgrade to an executive membership we continue to experience strong member renewal rates currently at 87 businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or other evidence of business existence may become business members business members generally pay an annual membership fee of 50 for the primary and spouse membership card with addon membership cards available for an annual fee of 40 including a free spouse card a significant number of our business members also shop at costco for their personal needs 

individual memberships gold star memberships are available to individuals who do not qualify for a business membership individual members generally pay an annual membership fee of 50 which includes a spouse card 

our membership base was made up of the following in thousands 

 

 the rates for business and gold star members discussed above reflect the 5 increase that went into effect on may 1 2006 for new members and july 1 2006 for existing members 

executive membership is available to all members in the us and canada for an annual fee of 100 the executive membership program offers members additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services offered by costco such as merchant credit card processing small business loans auto and home insurance business telephone service check printing and real estate and mortgage services the services offered are generally provided by thirdparty providers and vary by state in addition executive members qualify for a 2 reward which can be redeemed at costco warehouses up to a maximum of 500 per year on all qualified purchases made at costco at the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006 executive members represented 23 and 20 respectively of our primary membership base and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase 

labor 

our employee count approximated 

 

 these numbers exclude approximately 9000 and 8000 individuals who were employed by costco mexico a 50owned joint venture as of september 2 2007 and september 3 2006 respectively which is not consolidated in our financial statements but is accounted for using the equity method approximately 13900 hourly employees in certain of our locations in california maryland new jersey new york and one warehouse in virginia are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters all remaining employees are nonunion we consider our employee relations to be very good 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection warehouse location and member service over 1200 warehouse club locations exist across the us and canada including our 454 north american warehouses and every major metropolitan area has one if not several club operations in addition to other membership warehouse operators such as walmart’s sam’s club and bj’s wholesale club we compete with a wide range of national and regional retailers and wholesalers including supermarkets supercenters general merchandise chains specialty chains gasoline stations as well as electronic commerce businesses walmart target and kohl’s are significant general merchandise retail competitors we also compete with lowcost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such as lowe’s home depot office depot petsmart staples trader joe’s whole foods best buy and barnes  noble 

regulation 

certain state laws require that we apply minimum markups to our selling prices for specific goods such as tobacco products alcoholic beverages and gasoline while compliance with such laws may cause us to charge somewhat higher prices than we otherwise would charge other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions and we believe that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on our operations 

it is our policy to sell at lower than manufacturers’ suggested retail prices some manufacturers attempt to maintain the resale price of their products by refusing to sell to us or to other purchasers that do not adhere to suggested retail prices or that otherwise sell at discounted prices to date we believe that we have not been materially affected by our inability to purchase directly from such manufacturers both federal and state legislation is proposed from time to time which if enacted would restrict our ability to purchase goods or extend the application of laws enabling the establishment of minimum prices we cannot predict the effect on our business of the enactment of such federal or state legislation 

certain states counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us within their jurisdictions we believe that if enacted such laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our operations 

available information 

we maintain an internet website at wwwcostcocom we make available through the investor relations section of our website free of charge our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k proxy statements and forms 3 4 and 5 and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with or furnishing such documents to the securities and exchange commission sec the information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the sec

 item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations they could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by our forwardlooking statements those statements may relate to such matters as sales growth increases in comparable store sales impact of cannibalization price changes earnings performance earnings per share stockbased compensation expense warehouse openings and closures the effect of adopting certain accounting standards future financial reporting financing margins return on invested capital strategic direction and the demand for our products and services you should read these risk factors in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this report there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not perceive them to be material that could cause results to differ materially from our expectations forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these forwardlooking statements you are advised however to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic filings with the sec 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could negatively affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for members employees warehouse sites products and services and in other important respects with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries we compete with other wholesale club operators discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors as well as electronic commerce retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercenter stores wholesale clubs internetbased retailers and catalog businesses such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise selection and availability services offered to members location store hours and price our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could negatively affect our financial performance some competitors may have greater financial resources better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance 

higher interest rates energy costs inflation levels of unemployment healthcare costs fluctuations of certain commodity prices consumer debt levels and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell these factors can also increase our cost of sales andor operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and results general economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events 

our growth strategy includes expanding our business both in existing markets and by opening warehouses in new markets 

our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to build or lease new warehouses we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of our warehouses as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of constructing leasing and operating our warehouses we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively will affect our ability to build or lease new warehouses which may have a material adverse affect on our future profitability 

we seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas a new warehouse may draw members away from our nearby existing warehouses and may cause comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses to slow or decline 

we also intend to open warehouses in new markets the risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence while we have a track record of profitable growth in new markets we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed as a result our future profitability may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 

any inability to open new warehouses on schedule could hurt our financial performance 

we expect to increase our presence in existing markets and enter new markets our opening of new warehouses domestically and internationally will depend on our ability to identify and secure suitable locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms attract and train qualified employees and manage preopening expenses including construction costs we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our warehouses our ability to open new warehouses also is affected by environmental regulations local zoning issues and other laws related to land use failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors will affect our ability to open warehouses on schedule which could adversely affect our financial performance 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our united states and canada operations 

our financial performance is highly dependent on our united states and canada operations which comprised 94 of consolidated net sales in both fiscal 2007 and 2006 and 93 and 94 of operating income in fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively furthermore we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 28 and 31 of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our united states and canada operations could arise from among other things failing to meet targets for warehouse openings declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor and healthcare costs cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets and failing consistently to provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members 

we depend on vendors to supply us with quality merchandise at the right time and at the right price 

we depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices we have no assurances of continued supply pricing or access to new products and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us sales demands may lead to insufficient instock positions of our merchandise 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

we purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers we have thousands of vendor relationships our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors and products from alternative sources if any may be of a lesser quality andor more expensive than those from existing vendors 

our vendors are subject to risks including labor disputes union organizing activities financial liquidity inclement weather natural disasters supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise for these or other reasons one or more of our vendors might not adhere to our quality control or legal or regulatory standards these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell to our members this failure could lead to litigation and recalls which could damage our reputation and our private label brand increase our costs and otherwise hurt our business 

in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control 

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition sales returns reserve impairment of longlived assets and warehouse closing costs inventories self insurance stockbased compensation income taxes unclaimed property laws and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our financial performance 

our international operations could form a larger portion of our business in future years future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many beyond our control these factors include political conditions economic conditions regulatory constraints currency regulations and exchange rates and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

now or in the future other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries laws and regulations of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the united states 

implementation of technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and fail to provide the anticipated benefits 

we have made and will continue to make significant technology investments both in our operations and in our administrative functions the costs potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the technology might fail 

market expectations for our financial performance is high 

we believe that the price of our stock reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet these expectations for our comparable warehouse sales growth rates earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings could cause the market price of our stock to drop 

cost related to natural disasters could unfavorably affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes particularly in california could unfavorably affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas delays in the delivery of goods to our depots or warehouses within a country in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters 

any failure to comply with these laws could result in costs to satisfy environmental compliance remediation requirements or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our operations 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may unfavorably affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings including grand jury investigations consumer employment tort and other litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could unfavorably affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources our business requires compliance with a great variety of laws and regulations failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards fines and penalties 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

failure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements providing reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud 

our success depends upon our ability to attract train and retain highly qualified employees 

to be successful we must attract train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified associates while controlling related labor costs our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs we compete with other retail and nonretail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them we also depend on our executives and other key employees for our success there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future 

if we do not maintain the security of memberrelated information we could damage our reputation with members incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

as do most retailers and wholesale club operators we receive certain personal information about our members in addition our online operations at wwwcostcocom and wwwcostcoca depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems or those of some of our suppliers or other business partners that results in our member’s personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

privacy and information security 

the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the international federal and state levels privacy and information security laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes if we or our business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach our reputation could be damaged possibly resulting in lost future business and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of noncompliance

 item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

  

 we believe it is helpful to disclose the effects of these items for purposes of providing a meaningful comparison of our current fiscal year results to prior fiscal years as well as provide a more representative expectation of future operating results the impact of each of these items noted above is presented below 

 

  net sales 

 

   

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

2007 vs 2006 

net sales increased 413 billion or 70 to 6309 billion in fiscal 2007 a 52week fiscal year from 5896 billion in fiscal 2006 a 53week fiscal year the 413 billion increase in net sales is comprised of 210 billion from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and 203 billion from sales at new warehouses opened during fiscal 2007 and 2006 partially offset by the change in the reserve for estimated sales returns 

changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increase gasoline sales contributed to the 413 billion net sales growth by approximately 3561 million with approximately 178 million of this increase related to the increase in gasoline sales prices 

most of the comparable sales growth derived from increased amounts spent by members visiting our warehouses while increases in frequency of shopping contributed slightly reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations gasoline sales did not have a material impact on comparable warehouse sales growth changes in foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately 4184 million or 72 basis points 

in our fourth fiscal quarter the decrease in our estimated sales returns reserve resulted in an increase to net sales of 579 million as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 where our reserve was increased resulting in a decrease to net sales of 331 million this improvement is primarily a result of the changes to our consumer electronics returns policy implemented in the spring of 2007 

2006 vs 2005 

net sales increased 137 to 5896 billion in fiscal 2006 from 5188 billion in fiscal 2005 the increase in net sales was primarily due to 8 from comparable warehouse sales growth 37 increase primarily from warehouse sales excluded from the comparable warehouse sales calculation and 2 from an additional week in fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior year gasoline sales positively impacted comparable warehouse sales growth by approximately 150 basis points changes in foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately 90 basis points 

most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members visiting our warehouses while increases in frequency of shopping contributed slightly comparable sales growth was slightly offset by cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations 

changes in prices of merchandise with the exception of gasoline did not materially affect the sales increase gasoline sales contributed to the 137 net sales growth by approximately 235 basis points in fiscal 2006 with approximately 70 of this increase related to the increase in gasoline sales prices 

membership fees 

 

   

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

2007 vs 2006 

membership fees increased 105 to 131 billion or 208 of net sales in fiscal 2007 from 119 billion or 202 of net sales in fiscal 2006 excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 discussed above adjusted membership fees increased 152 from fiscal 2006 this increase was primarily due to a five dollar increase in our annual membership fee for our us and canada gold star individual business and business addon members which was effective may 1 2006 for new members and july 1 2006 for existing members increased penetration of the higherfee executive membership program and additional membership signups at the 30 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2007 

2006 vs 2005 

membership fees increased 107 to 119 billion or 202 of net sales in fiscal 2006 from 107 billion or 207 of net sales in fiscal 2005 this increase was primarily due to increased penetration of the executive membership program and additional membership signups at the 25 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2006 

gross margin 

 

 2007 vs 2006 

gross margin was 664 billion in fiscal 2007 or 1052 of net sales compared to 622 billion or 1055 of net sales in fiscal 2006 excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in fiscal 2007 adjusted gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 1058 or an increase of 3 basis points as compared to fiscal 2006 this increase was primarily due to a 24 basis point increase in certain merchandise departments largely food and sundries as well as smaller increases in certain warehouse ancillary businesses costcocom and our international operations offset by a decrease in our hardlines and softlines categories of approximately 15 basis points in addition increased penetration of the executive membership twopercent reward program and increased spending by executive members negatively affected gross margin by six basis points 

in our fourth fiscal quarter the decrease in our reserve for estimated sales returns resulted in an improvement of gross margin of approximately 2 basis points this improvement is primarily a result of the changes to our consumer electronics returns policy implemented in the spring of 2007 

2006 vs 2005 

gross margin was 622 billion in fiscal 2006 or 1055 of net sales compared to 553 billion or 1066 of net sales in fiscal 2005 this eleven basis point decrease reflected increased penetration of 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

the executive membership twopercent reward program and increased spending by executive members which decreased gross margin by ten basis points additionally a decrease of four basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments and warehouse ancillary businesses was primarily due to changes in the sales mix with higher sales penetration of lower margin departments and slightly lower overall gross margins in our hardlines and softlines categories these decreases were partially offset by a three basis point improvement related to valuing inventories following the lastinfirstout lifo method 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 2007 vs 2006 

sga expenses were 627 billion or 994 of net sales in fiscal 2007 compared to 573 billion or 972 of net sales in fiscal 2006 excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and sga expenses in fiscal 2007 adjusted sga as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 980 an increase of eight basis points of this increase 3 basis points were primarily due to an increase in stockbased compensation and a net 5 basis points were due to an increase in warehouse payroll and benefits costs the payroll increase was largely attributed to hourly rate increases that went into effect in march 2007 and a lower overall comparable warehouse sales increase 

2006 vs 2005 

sga expenses were 573 billion or 972 of net sales in fiscal 2006 compared to 506 billion or 976 of net sales in fiscal 2005 improved warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted sga by approximately nine basis points primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll which was positively impacted by strong comparable warehouse sales and a lower rate of increase in workers’ compensation costs this improvement was partially offset by an increase in stockbased compensation cost of approximately five basis points in fiscal 2006 

preopening expenses 

 

 preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses warehouse remodel projects and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses preopening 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

expenses per warehouse opening can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our fiscal year end whether the warehouse is owned or leased whether the opening is in an existing new or international market and the number and magnitude of warehouse remodel projects 

2007 vs 2006 

preopening expenses totaled 552 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 425 million in fiscal 2006 this increase is primarily due to increased warehouse remodel activity and international openings 

2006 vs 2005 

preopening expenses totaled 425 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 532 million in fiscal 2005 during fiscal 2005 we adjusted our method of accounting for leases entered into over the previous twenty years primarily related to ground leases at certain owned warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction we recorded a cumulative pretax noncash charge of 160 million to preopening expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 excluding this charge preopening expenses increased year over year due to the increase in warehouse openings 

provision for impaired assets and closing costs net 

 

 the provision primarily includes costs related to impairment of longlived assets future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities accelerated depreciation on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property 

2007 vs 2006 

the net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was 136 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 55 million in fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2007 approximately 130 million of this provision related to the acceleration of depreciation on ten buildings expected to be relocated in fiscal 2008 

2006 vs 2005 

the net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was 55 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 164 million in fiscal 2005 the provision for fiscal 2006 included charges of 38 million for warehouse closing expenses and 17 million for net losses on the sale of real property the provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of 116 million for warehouse closing expenses primarily related to lease obligations and accelerated building depreciation 39 million for impairment of longlived assets and 09 million for net losses on the sale of real property

2006 vs 2005 

interest expense totaled 126 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 344 million in fiscal 2005 interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily included interest on the 2002 senior notes the zero coupon notes and balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes in fiscal 2005 interest expense also included interest on the 7 1  8  senior notes the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the repayment of the 7 1  8  senior notes in june 2005 in addition interest expense decreased on the zero coupon notes as note holders converted into common stock approximately 2865 million in principal amount of the zero coupon notes or 1889 million after factoring in the related debt discount the amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal 2006 due to increased warehouse openings contributing to the decrease in interest expense as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased the overall decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the increase in interest rates on the 2002 senior notes which were swapped into variable rate debt in march 2002 

interest income and other 

 

   

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

2007 vs 2006 

interest income and other totaled 1655 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 1384 million in fiscal 2006 this increase is largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 senior notes as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates primarily our investment in costco mexico a 50owned joint venture 

2006 vs 2005 

interest income and other totaled 1384 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 1091 million in fiscal 2005 this increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 

provision for income taxes 

 

 the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 was 3668 3701 and 3137 respectively the lower rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a nonrecurring 542 million income tax benefit primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the united states and canada covering the years 19962003 and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings subject to repatriation of 206 million excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 3620 

net income

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table itemizes our most liquid assets dollars in thousands 

 

 our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments balances which were 336 billion and 283 billion at september 2 2007 and september 3 2006 respectively of these balances approximately 6552 million and 5936 million at september 2 2007 and september 3 2006 respectively represented debit and credit card receivables primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the yearend close the increase in our most liquid assets of 5224 million to 336 billion at september 2 2007 was due primarily to the issuance of the 2007 senior notes and the cash provided by our operating activities offset by expenditures for the repurchase of our common stock and the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 208 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to 183 billion in fiscal 2006 an increase of 2452 million this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash flow due to a decrease in our investment in net merchandise inventories merchandise inventory less accounts payable of 3788 million offset by a decrease in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of 1304 million 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 6553 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 116 billion in fiscal 2006 respectively a decrease of approximately 5022 million the decrease in cash used in investing activities relates primarily to an increase of 1692 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects offset by an increase in cash provided by the net reductions in shortterm investments of 6638 million 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 1646 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 123 billion in fiscal 2006 the 11 billion decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of the 2007 senior notes in february 2007 which provided approximately 199 billion in 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

proceeds this was partially offset by the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2007 which used 198 billion of cash compared to 144 billion in fiscal 2006 an increase of approximately 5348 million and the repayment of longterm debt of 3079 million related primarily to the 2002 senior notes retired in march 2007

 expansion plans 

our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of land building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements 

while there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review it is management’s current intention to spend approximately 16 billion to 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

18 billion during fiscal 2008 for real estate construction remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations these expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

plans for the united states and canada during fiscal 2008 are to open approximately 38 to 42 new warehouses inclusive of 8 to 10 relocations to larger and betterlocated facilities we expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations including the united kingdom and asia along with other international markets 

additional equity investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures 

in each of fiscal years 2006 and 2005 we contributed an additional 15 million to our investment in costco mexico a 50owned joint venture which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount there were no such contributions in 2007

in august 1997 we completed the sale of 9000 million principal amount at maturity zero coupon notes due in august 2017 the zero coupon notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 35 resulting in gross proceeds to us of 4496 million the current notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 15 million shares of costco common stock shares at an initial conversion price of 2271 holders of the zero coupon notes may require us to purchase the zero coupon notes at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase in august 2012 we may redeem at our option the zero coupon notes at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption any time in or after august 2002 as of september 2 2007 8324 million in principal amount of the zero coupon notes had been converted by note holders to shares of costco common stock of which 612 million and 2865 million in principal were converted in fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively or 423 million and 1889 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively after factoring in the related debt discount 

derivatives 

we have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage welldefined interest rate and foreign exchange risks forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms these forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting the aggregate notional amount which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at september 2 2007 and september 3 2006 was 750 million and 635 million respectively the marktomarket adjustment related to these contracts was 09 million and 11 million at september 2 2007 and september 3 2006 respectively the majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our whollyowned united kingdom subsidiary primarily to hedge us dollar merchandise inventory purchases 

effective march 25 2002 we entered into “fixedtofloating” interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our 2002 senior notes which matured and were retired in march 2007 the swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the debt as the terms of the swaps matched those of the underlying hedged debt changes in the fair value of the swaps were offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and resulted in no net earnings impact at september 3 2006 the aggregate value of the swaps was 1 million and was recorded in “deferred income taxes and other current assets” in our consolidated balance sheets in march 2007 upon maturity of the debt and expiration of the swap agreements the aggregate fair value of the swaps was zero 

we are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing which we partially mitigate through the use of firmprice contracts with counterparties for approximately 23 of our locations in the us and canada the effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented

offbalance sheet arrangements 

with the exception of our operating leases we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements 

stock repurchase programs 

in january and july of 2006 our board of directors approved an additional 100 billion and 200 billion of stock repurchases respectively which expire in 2009 bringing total authorizations by our board of directors since inception of the program in fiscal 2001 to 450 billion subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007 our board of directors approved an additional 3000 million of stock repurchases which expires in 2010 

during fiscal 2007 we repurchased 364 million shares at an average price of 5439 totaling approximately 198 billion during fiscal 2006 we repurchased 284 million shares of common stock at an average price of 5144 totaling approximately 146 billion the remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately 6464 million at september 2 2007 purchases are made from timetotime as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases or pursuant to plans under sec rule 10b51 repurchased shares are retired 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments we continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition merchandise inventory valuation impairment of longlived assets warehouse closing costs insuranceselfinsurance liabilities and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 

revenue recognition 

we generally recognize sales net of estimated returns at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels 

in connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy in the spring of 2007 we examined operational data regarding member return patterns that had not been previously analyzed the data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve accordingly as previously disclosed during fiscal 2007 we increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of 4526 million and a pretax charge to income of 943 million for the related gross margin and disposition costs 

we evaluate the criteria of the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf 9919 “reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent” in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when we are the primary obligor subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers influence product or service specifications or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded on a gross basis if we are not the 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above we record the net amounts as commissions earned which is reflected in net sales 

membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members we account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over oneyear in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each member’s specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method which was based on the period in which the fee was collected this review resulted in a 562 million reduction to membership fee revenue and corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet this adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors 

our executive members qualify for a 2 reward which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses up to a maximum of 500 per year on all qualified purchases made at costco we account for this 2 reward as a reduction in sales with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of nonredemptions based on historical data 

merchandise inventories 

merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the lastin firstout lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the firstin firstout fifo method we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues we record an adjustment each quarter if necessary for the expected annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at fiscal yearend at both september 2 2007 and september 3 2006 merchandise inventories valued at lifo approximated fifo after considering the lower of cost or market principle 

we provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory count which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year 

inventory cost where appropriate is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones terms of agreement or other systematic and rational approaches 

impairment of longlived assets and warehouse closing costs 

we periodically evaluate our longlived assets for indicators of impairment such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their thencurrent fair market value 

we provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated a considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

liability particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations these estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets we make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location we reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change 

insuranceself insurance liabilities 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including a whollyowned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool to provide for potential liabilities for workers’ compensation general liability property damage director and officers’ liability vehicle liability and employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment is required in assessing among other things the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged when facts and circumstances change we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 the estimated cumulative impact of adopting fin 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas 157 which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fairvalue measurements required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value sfas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted we must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment to fasb no 115” sfas 159 under sfas 159 entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

on a contractbycontract basis with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period the election called the fair value option will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions sfas 159 is effective as of the beginning of a company’s first fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 we must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009 

we are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of sfas 157 and sfas 159 will have on our future consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

the nature and amount of our long and shortterm debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors as of september 2 2007 our fixedrate longterm debt included 676 million principal amount at maturity of 35 zero coupon convertible subordinated notes carried at 478 million 9000 million of 53 senior notes carried at 8978 million 110 billion of 55 senior notes carried at 109 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling 1279 million fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixedrate debt 

we hold interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds we diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investmentgrade securities through a combination of internal and thirdparty investment management shortterm investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as shortterm based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations as the majority of these instruments are of a shortterm nature if interest rates were to increase or decrease there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments for those instruments that are classified as available for sale the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholder’s equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss based on our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances at september 2 2007 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately 152 million pretax to interest income on an annual basis 

most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates we periodically enter into shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases the notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at september 2 2007 was 750 million

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation

 item 1—business 

costco wholesale corporation “costco” or the “company” began operations in 1983 in seattle washington in october 1993 we merged with the price company which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept in 1976 to form pricecostco inc a delaware corporation in january 1997 after the spinoff of most of our nonwarehouse assets to price enterprises inc we changed our name to costco companies inc on august 30 1999 we reincorporated from delaware to washington and changed our name to costco wholesale corporation our common stock trades on the nasdaq under the symbol “cost” 

general 

we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover this rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers mass merchandisers supermarkets and supercenters 

we buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a crossdocking consolidation point “depot” or directly to our warehouses our depots receive containerbased shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for combined shipment to our individual warehouses generally in less than twentyfour hours this maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies thereby lowering our receiving costs by eliminating many of the costs associated with multiple step distribution channels which include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers use of central receiving storing and distributing warehouses and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor 

because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover we generally have the opportunity to sell and be paid for inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors even though we take advantage of early payment discounts as sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by vendors rather than by our working capital 

our typical warehouse format averages approximately 140000 square feet floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the availability of low prices our warehouses need not be located on prime commercial real estate sites or have elaborate facilities by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format we have limited inventory losses to less than twotenths of one percent of net sales in each of the last three fiscal years—well below those of typical discount retail operations 

we generally limit marketing and promotional activities to new warehouse openings occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and direct marketing programs such as the costco connection to existing members promoting selected merchandise these practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical retailers discount retailers and supermarkets in connection with new warehouse openings our marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members these contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening potential gold star individual members are contacted by direct

mail or by providing membership offerings to be distributed through employee associations and other entities after a membership base is established in an area most new memberships result from wordofmouth advertising followup messages distributed through regular payroll or other organizational communications to employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective business and gold star members 

our warehouses generally operate on a sevenday 69hour week generally warehouses are open weekdays between 1000 am and 830 pm with earlier closing hours on the weekend gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers discount retailers and supermarkets and due to other operational efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking 

our merchandising strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than could be obtained through traditional wholesalers mass merchandisers supermarkets and supercenters an important element of this strategy is to carry only those products on which we can provide our members significant cost savings items that members may request but that cannot be purchased at prices low enough to pass along meaningful cost savings are often not carried we seek to limit specific items in each product line to fastselling models sizes and colors therefore we carry an average of approximately 4000 active stockkeeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business as opposed to discount retailers and supermarkets that normally stock 40000 to 60000 skus or more these practices are consistent with our membership policies of satisfying both the business and personal shopping needs of our wholesale members thereby encouraging high volume shopping many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only appliances equipment and tools often feature commercial and professional models in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction our policy is to accept returns of merchandise 

the following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by major category of items 

 

   

item 1—business continued 

  

ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently the following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses 

 

 our ecommerce businesses costcocom in the us and costcoca in canada provide our members additional products generally not found in our warehouses in addition to services such as digital photo processing pharmacy travel and membership services 

our warehouses accept cash checks certain debit cards american express and a private label costco credit card losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from cashing checks at the point of sale until restitution is made 

we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise no significant portion of merchandise is obtained from any one of these or any other single supplier we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable we would be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of our business we also purchase selected private label merchandise as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater 

financial information of our segments and geographic areas is included in note 12 segment reporting to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

we report on a 5253week fiscal year consisting of thirteen fourweek periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august the first second and third quarters consist of three periods each and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53week year there is no material seasonal impact on our operations except an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season fiscal year 2006 was a 53week year and fiscal years 2005 and 2004 each consisted of 52 weeks 

membership policy 

our membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue which allows us to offer low prices 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

members can utilize their memberships at any costco warehouse location we have two primary types of members business and gold star individual in addition members can upgrade to an executive membership we continue to experience strong member renewal rates currently at 865 as of september 3 2006 our membership base was made up of the following in thousands

competition 

our industry is highly competitive based on factors such as price merchandise quality and selection location and member service in addition to other membership warehouse operators we 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

compete with a wide range of national and regional retailers and wholesalers including supermarkets supercenters general merchandise chains specialty chains gasoline stations as well as ecommerce businesses over 1178 warehouse club locations exist across the us and canada including our 426 north american warehouses and every major metropolitan area has one if not several club operations walmart has become the largest retailer in the world and has expanded further into various food merchandising formats target and kohl’s have also emerged as significant retail competitors lowcost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such as lowe’s home depot office depot petsmart staples best buy and barnes  noble have significant market share in their respective categories 

regulation 

certain state laws require that we apply minimum markups to our selling prices for specific goods such as tobacco products alcoholic beverages and gasoline while compliance with such laws may cause us to charge somewhat higher prices than we otherwise would charge other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions and we believe that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on our operations 

it is our policy to sell at lower than manufacturers’ suggested retail prices some manufacturers attempt to maintain the resale price of their products by refusing to sell to us or to other purchasers that do not adhere to suggested retail prices or that otherwise sell at discounted prices to date we believe that we have not been materially affected by our inability to purchase directly from such manufacturers both federal and state legislation is proposed from time to time which if enacted would restrict our ability to purchase goods or extend the application of laws enabling the establishment of minimum prices we cannot predict the effect on our business of the enactment of such federal or state legislation 

certain states counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including us within their jurisdictions we believe that if enacted such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations

 item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations they could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by our forwardlooking statements those statements may relate to such matters as sales growth increases in comparable store sales impact of cannibalization commodity price changes earnings performance earnings per share stockbased compensation expense warehouse openings and closures the effect of adopting certain accounting standards future financial reporting financing margins return on invested capital strategic direction and the demand for our products and services all of our forwardlooking statements are qualified by the risks described below these risks are not the only risks we face our operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 

we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could adversely affect our financial performance 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for members employees warehouse sites products and services and in other important respects with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in foreign countries we compete with other wholesale club operators discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors as well as ecommerce retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercenter stores wholesale clubs internetbased retailers and catalog businesses such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise selection and availability services offered to members location store hours and price our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance some competitors may have greater financial resources better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do 

general economic factors domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance 

higher interest rates energy costs inflation levels of unemployment consumer debt levels and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell that adversely affects profitability these factors can also increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our operations and results general economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events 

our growth strategy includes expanding our business both in existing markets and by opening warehouses in new markets 

our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to build or lease new warehouses we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our warehouses local land use local zoning issues environmental regulations and other regulations applicable to the types of warehouses we desire to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations and also influence the cost of constructing and leasing our warehouses we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively will affect our ability to build or lease new warehouses which may have a material adverse affect on our future profitability 

we seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas a new warehouse may draw members away from our nearby existing warehouses and may cause comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses to decline 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

we also intend to open warehouses in new markets the risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large established market presence while we have a track record of profitable growth in new markets we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed as a result our future profitability may be materially adversely affected 

any inability to open new warehouses on schedule could hurt our financial performance 

we expect to increase our presence in existing markets and enter new markets our opening of new warehouses domestically and internationally will depend on our ability to identify and secure suitable locations negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms attract and train qualified employees and manage preopening expenses including construction costs we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our warehouses our ability to open new warehouses also is affected by environmental regulations local zoning issues and other laws related to land use failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors will affect our ability to open warehouses on schedule which could adversely affect our financial performance 

we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our united states and canada operations 

our financial performance is highly dependent on our united states and canada operations which comprised 94 of consolidated net sales in both fiscal 2006 and 2005 within the united states we are highly dependent on our california operations which comprised 31 and 30 of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively any substantial or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results declines in financial performance of our united states and canada operations could arise from among other things failing to meet annual targets for warehouse openings declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations negative trends in operating expenses including increased labor costs cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets and failing consistently to provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members 

risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our financial performance 

the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers effective global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control we may also face changes in the cost to us of accepting various payment methods and changes in the rate of utilization of these payment methods by our members 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could adversely affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns could adversely affect our relationship with our members the demand for our products and services and our market share 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results 

generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition impairment of longlived assets and warehouse closing costs inventories self insurance stockbased compensation income taxes unclaimed property laws and litigation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by our management changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 

our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our financial performance 

our international operations could form a larger portion of our net sales in future years future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many beyond our control these factors include political conditions economic conditions regulatory constraints currency regulations and exchange rates and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries laws and regulations of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the united states 

implementation of technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and fail to provide the anticipated benefits 

we have made and will continue to make significant technology investments both in our warehouses and in our administrative functions the cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term in addition new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the technology might fail 

market expectations for our financial performance is high 

we believe that the price of our stock reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet these expectations for our comparable warehouse sales growth rates earnings per share and new warehouse openings could cause the market price of our stock to drop 

  

item 1a—risk factors continued 

  

cost related to natural disasters could adversely affect our financial performance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes particularly in california where over 30 of our net sales are generated could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas delay in the delivery of goods to our depots or warehouses within a country in which we are operating and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state regional local and international laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and other environmental matters 

while we believe that our operations are currently in material compliance with all environmental laws any failure to comply with these laws could result in costs to satisfy environmental compliance remediation requirements or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by government agencies or courts that could adversely affect our operations 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs 

we are involved in a number of legal proceedings including consumer employment tort and other litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by government authorities the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources our business requires compliance with a great variety of laws and regulations failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards fines and penalties 

failure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements providing reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud

changes in prices of merchandise with the exception of gasoline did not materially affect the sales increase gasoline sales contributed to the 137 increase in net sales by approximately 235 basis points for fiscal 2006 with approximately 70 of this increase related to the change in price in addition translation of foreign sales into us dollars contributed to the increase in sales due to stronger foreign currencies accounting for approximately 87 basis points of the comparable yearoveryear sales increase 

2005 vs 2004 

net sales increased 100 to 5188 billion in fiscal 2005 from 4715 billion in fiscal 2004 the increase was due to comparable warehouse sales growth of 7 and to the opening of 16 new warehouses 21 opened 5 closed due to relocations during fiscal 2005 net sales were reduced by the implementation of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 0310 “application of issue no 0216 “accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor” by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers” eitf 0310 which was effective at the beginning of our fiscal 2004 third quarter eitf 0310 which primarily impacts our vendor coupon programs reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect our consolidated gross margin or net income had eitf 0310 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2004 the net sales increase in fiscal 2005 would have been 105 and the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2005 would have been 8 

changes in prices of merchandise with the exception of gasoline did not materially affect the sales increase gasoline sales contributed to the 100 increase in net sales by approximately 155 basis points for fiscal 2005 with approximately 62 of this increase related to the change in price in addition translation of foreign sales into us dollars contributed to the increase in sales due to stronger foreign currencies accounting for approximately 134 basis points of the comparable yearoveryear sales increase 

membership fees 

 

 2006 vs 2005 

membership fees increased 107 to 119 billion or 202 of net sales in fiscal 2006 from 107 billion or 207 of net sales in fiscal 2005 this increase was primarily due to additional membership signups at the 25 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2006 increased penetration of the executive membership program and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years currently 865 

in april 2006 we announced plans to increase annual membership fees by 5 for our us and canada gold star individual business and business addon members effective may 1 2006 for new members and july 1 2006 for renewals approximately 15 million members will be affected by this increase membership fees are accounted for on a deferred basis whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over the oneyear term of the membership which will have the effect of spreading the full realization of the increase over the next two fiscal years 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

2005 vs 2004 

membership fees increased 116 to 107 billion or 207 of net sales in fiscal 2005 from 961 million or 204 of net sales in fiscal 2004 this increase was primarily due to additional membership signups at the 16 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2005 increased penetration of our executive membership program and a high overall member renewal rate of 86 

gross margin 

 

 2006 vs 2005 

gross margin was 622 billion in fiscal 2006 or 1055 of net sales compared to 553 billion or 1066 of net sales in fiscal 2006 this eleven basis point decrease reflected increased penetration of the executive membership twopercent reward program and increased spending by executive members which decreased gross margin by ten basis points additionally a decrease of four basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments and warehouse ancillary businesses was primarily due to changes in the sales mix with higher sales penetration of lower margin departments and slightly lower overall gross margins in our hardlines and softlines categories these decreases were partially offset by a three basis point improvement due to the absence of a charge to inventories following the lastin firstout lifo method 

2005 vs 2004 

gross margin increased 94 to 553 billion or 1066 of net sales in fiscal 2005 from 506 billion or 1073 of net sales in fiscal 2004 this seven basis point decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflected a decrease of three basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments the three basis point decrease in merchandising is largely due to changes in the sales mix with higher penetration of lower margin departments this effect was offset by gross margin gains in most of our merchandise departments as well as our international operations gross margin as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted by five basis points due to the implementation of eitf 0310 whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced equally the gross margin percentage was reduced by ten basis points due to the increased penetration of the executive member twopercent reward program increased spending by executive members and the resulting increases in the related costs 

the gross margin figures reflect accounting for most us merchandise inventories on the lifo method fiscal 2005 included a 130 million lifo charge increase in merchandise costs while fiscal 2004 included a 60 million lifo charge the impact of the lifo adjustment on a yearoveryear basis negatively impacted gross margin as a percentage of sales by one additional basis point

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 2006 vs 2005 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 573 billion or 972 of net sales in fiscal 2006 compared to 506 billion or 976 of net sales in fiscal 2005 improved warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted sga by approximately nine basis points primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll which was positively impacted by strong comparable warehouse sales and a lower rate of increase in workers’ compensation costs this improvement was partially offset by an increase in stockbased compensation cost of approximately five basis points in fiscal 2006 

2005 vs 2004 

sga expenses were 506 billion or 976 of net sales in fiscal 2005 compared to 460 billion or 976 of net sales in fiscal 2004 had eitf 0310 been in effect for all of fiscal 2004 sga expenses as a percent of net sales would have shown improvement of four basis points as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2005 

for fiscal 2005 warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted sga comparisons yearoveryear by approximately ten basis points primarily due to improved payroll utilization at the warehouse level including increased leverage from increased comparable sales and cost control measures employed in employee benefits primarily health care this improvement was offset by the implementation of eitf 0310 which negatively impacted sga as a percentage of net sales by five basis points and an increase in stockbased compensation costs approximating six basis points yearoveryear 

preopening expenses

2005 vs 2004 

interest expense totaled 344 million in fiscal 2005 compared to 367 million in fiscal 2004 interest expense in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 included interest on the 3 1  2  zero coupon notes the 7 1  8  and 5 1  2  senior notes and on balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes the decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest on our 3 1  2  zero coupon notes as note holders converted approximately 2808 million in principle amount of the notes into common stock during fiscal 2005 additionally capitalized interest increased yearoveryear as interest rates and construction costs increased in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 these decreases were partially offset by increases in interest on the senior notes as these fixed rate instruments were swapped into variable rate debt in november 2001 and march 2002 which was mitigated by the fact that the 7 1  8  senior notes matured and were repaid on june 15 2005 

interest income and other 

 

 2006 vs 2005 

interest income and other totaled 1384 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 1091 million in fiscal 2005 this increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 

2005 vs 2004 

interest income and other totaled 1091 million in fiscal 2005 compared to 516 million in fiscal 2004 the increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher cash and cash equivalents balances and shortterm investments on hand throughout fiscal 2005 as well as higher interest rates earned on the balances as compared to fiscal 2004

provision for income taxes 

 

 the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 was 3701 3137 and 3700 respectively the low rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a nonrecurring 542 million income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the united states and canada covering the years 19962003 and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of 206 million excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 362

liquidity and capital resources dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

the following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets 

 

 our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments balances which were 283 billion and 346 billion at september 3 2006 and august 28 2005 respectively of these balances approximately 594 million and 522 million at september 3 2006 and august 28 2005 respectively represented debit and credit card receivables primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the yearend close the decrease in our most liquid assets of 627 million to 283 billion at september 3 2006 was due primarily to the repurchase of our common stock the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and the payment of cash dividends 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 183 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to 178 billion in fiscal 2005 an increase of 51 million this increase is attributable to higher net income and an increase in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of 338 million offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories merchandise inventory less accounts payable of 388 million 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 115 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to 205 billion in fiscal 2005 the decrease relates primarily to a decrease in the net investment in shortterm investments of 116 billion offset by an increase of 217 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects the decrease in the net investment in shortterm investments was due primarily to our stock repurchase activity 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 123 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to 519 million in fiscal 2005 the increase of 715 million primarily resulted from the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2006 which used 144 billion of cash compared to 413 million in fiscal 2005 in addition 304 million was used in fiscal 2005 for the repayment of the 7 1  8  senior notes

 expansion plans 

our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of the land building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements 

while there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review it is management’s current intention to spend approximately 14 billion to 16 billion during fiscal 2007 for real estate construction remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations these expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

plans for the united states and canada during fiscal 2007 are to open approximately 33 to 35 new warehouses on a net basis inclusive of one to two relocations we expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations including the united kingdom and asia along with other international markets at present we are planning to open one additional warehouse in the united kingdom during fiscal 2007 costco mexico plans to open one to two new warehouses during fiscal 2007

in february 1996 we filed with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement for 500 million of senior debt securities in october 2001 additional debt securities of 100 million were registered the 300 million of 5 1  2  senior notes issued in march 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to 300 million in april 2006 we cancelled the shelf registration

derivatives 

we have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage welldefined interest rate and foreign exchange risks forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms the aggregate notional amount which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at september 3 2006 and august 28 2005 was 63 million and 42 million respectively the majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our whollyowned united kingdom subsidiary primarily to hedge us dollar merchandise inventory purchases 

we also hold interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings and the mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt as of september 3 2006 and august 28 2005 we had “fixedtofloating” interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 300 million and an aggregate fair value of 1 million and 8 million respectively these amounts were recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets as of september 3 2006 and in other assets as of 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

august 28 2005 in our consolidated balance sheets these swaps were entered into effective march 25 2002 and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of our 300 million 5 1  2  senior notes as the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact 

we are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing which we partially mitigate through the use of firmprice contracts with counterparties for approximately 19 of our locations in the us and canada the effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

with the exception of our operating leases we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements 

stock repurchase programs 

our board of directors has approved the following stock repurchase programs 000’s

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates including those related to revenue recognition merchandise inventory valuation impairment of longlived assets warehouse closing costs insuranceselfinsurance liabilities stockbased compensation and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 

revenue recognition 

we recognize sales net of estimated returns at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

merchandise or the performance of services the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the sale or service is completed we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels 

we evaluate the criteria of the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf 9919 “reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent” in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when we are the primary obligor subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers influence product or service specifications or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded on a gross basis if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above we record the net amounts as commissions earned which is reflected in net sales 

membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members we account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year our executive members qualify for a 2 reward which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses up to a maximum of 500 per year on all qualified purchases made at costco we account for this 2 reward as a reduction in sales with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities 

merchandise inventories 

merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the lastin firstout lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the firstin firstout fifo method we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues we record an adjustment each quarter if necessary for the expected annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at yearend at both september 3 2006 and august 28 2005 merchandise inventories valued at lifo approximated fifo after considering the lower of cost or market principle 

we provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the actual physical inventory count results which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year 

inventory cost where appropriate is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones terms of agreement or other systematic and rational approach 

impairment of longlived assets and warehouse closing costs 

we periodically evaluate our longlived assets for indicators of impairment our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist requiring an adjustment of these assets to their thencurrent fair market value 

we provide estimates for warehouse closing costs based on applicable us generally accepted accounting principles future circumstances may result in actual closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

insuranceself insurance liabilities 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms including a whollyowned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool to provide for potential liabilities for workers’ compensation general liability property damage director and officers’ liability vehicle liability and employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside expertise demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

stock–based compensation 

we account for stock–based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r we use the black–scholes option–pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term volatility and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock–based compensation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we ceased the granting of stock options in favor of restricted stock units 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment is required in assessing among other things the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged when facts and circumstances change we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements” sab 108 sab 108 addresses how the effects of prioryear uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in currentyear financial statements sab 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and incomestatement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors we earlyadopted sab 108 as of august 29 2005 the beginning of our fiscal year see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for further discussion 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas 157 sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fairvalue measurements required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value sfas 157 is effective for our fiscal year 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas 157 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective beginning in fiscal 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin 48 

in june 2006 the fasb ratified the consensus reached on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 0603 “how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is gross versus net presentation” the eitf reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure eitf 0603 is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december 15 2006 amounts collected from our members which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are and have been recorded on a net basis we have no intention of modifying this accounting policy therefore the adoption of eitf 0603 will not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of accounting principles board opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” sfas 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements for changes in accounting principles unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change sfas 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change indirect effects of a change in accounting principle such as a change in nondiscretionary profitsharing payments resulting from an accounting change should be recognized in the period of the accounting change sfas 154 also requires that a change in depreciation amortization or depletion method for longlived nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle sfas 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 we will adopt the provisions of sfas 154 beginning in fiscal 2007 we do not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates as a policy we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

the nature and amount of our long and shortterm debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors as of september 3 2006 our fixed rate longterm debt included 129 million principal amount at maturity zero coupon subordinated notes carried at 88 million and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling 135 million our debt also includes 300 million 5 1  2  senior notes carried at 301 million we entered into “fixedtofloating” interest rate swaps on the senior notes effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities as of september 3 2006 and august 28 2005 we had “fixedtofloating” interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 300 million and an aggregate fair value of 1 million and 8 million respectively fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt 

we hold interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity while seeking to maximize the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds we diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investmentgrade securities and through a combination of internal and thirdparty investment management shortterm investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as shortterm based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations as the majority of these instruments are of a shortterm nature if interest rates were to increase or decrease there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments for those instruments that are classified as available for sale the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss based on our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments balances at september 3 2006 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately 9 million to interest income pretax on an annual basis 

most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates we periodically enter into shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases the notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at september 3 2006 was 62 million

 item 1—business 

  

costco wholesale corporation “costco” or the “company” began operations in 1983 in seattle washington in october 1993 costco merged with the price company which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept in 1976 to form pricecostco inc a delaware corporation in january 1997 after the spinoff of most of its nonwarehouse assets to price enterprises inc the company changed its name to costco companies inc on august 30 1999 the company reincorporated from delaware to washington and changed its name to costco wholesale corporation which trades on the nasdaq under the symbol “cost” 

  

general 

  

costco operates membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover this rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities enables costco to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers discount retailers and supermarkets 

  

costco buys the majority of its merchandise directly from manufacturers for shipment either directly to costco’s selling warehouses or to a consolidation point “depot” where various shipments are combined so as to minimize freight and handling costs as a result costco eliminates many of the costs associated with multiple step distribution channels which include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers use of central receiving storing and distributing warehouses and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor by providing this more costeffective means of distributing goods costco meets the needs of business customers who otherwise would pay a premium for small purchases and for the distribution services of traditional wholesalers and who cannot otherwise obtain the full range of their product requirements from any single source in addition these business members will often combine personal shopping with their business purchases the cost savings on brand name and selected private label merchandise are the primary motivation for individuals shopping for their personal needs costco’s merchandise selection is designed to appeal to both the business and consumer requirements of its members by offering a wide range of nationally branded and selected private label products often in case carton or multiplepack quantities at attractively low prices 

  

because of its high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover costco generally has the opportunity to receive cash from the sale of a substantial portion of its inventory at mature warehouse operations before it is required to pay all its merchandise vendors even though costco takes advantage of early payment terms to obtain payment discounts as sales in a given warehouse increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid a greater percentage of the inventory is financed through payment terms provided by vendors rather than by working capital 

  

costco’s typical warehouse format averages approximately 139000 square feet floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space in the handling of merchandise and in the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the availability of low prices on brand name and selected private label goods costco’s warehouses need not be located on prime commercial real estate sites or have elaborate facilities 

  

by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of its warehouses and using a membership format costco has been able to limit inventory losses to less than twotenths of one percent of net sales—well below those of typical discount retail operations losses associated with dishonored checks have also been minimal and bank information from business members is verified prior to establishing a check purchase limit members are identified and prevented from cashing checks at the point of sale when they have presented dishonored checks to costco 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

costco’s policy is generally to limit marketing and promotional expenses to new warehouse openings occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and direct marketing programs to existing members promoting selected merchandise these practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical discount retailers and supermarkets in connection with new warehouse openings costco’s marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members these contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening potential gold star individual members are contacted by direct mail or by providing such mailings to be distributed through employee associations and other entities after a membership base is established in an area most new memberships result from wordofmouth advertising followup contact by direct mail distributed through regular payroll or other organizational communications to employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective wholesale members 

  

costco’s warehouses generally operate on a sevenday 69hour week and are open somewhat longer during the holiday season generally warehouses are open weekdays between 1000 am and 830 pm with earlier closing hours on the weekend gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional wholesalers discount grocery retailers and supermarkets and due to other operational efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking in addition sales are processed through centralized automated checkout stands most items are not individually pricemarked rather each item is barcoded so it can be scanned into electronic cash registers this allows price changes without remarking merchandise substantially all manufacturers provide merchandise premarked with the item numbers and bar codes and many provide special larger package sizes 

  

costco’s merchandising strategy is to provide the customer with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than could be obtained through traditional wholesalers discount retailers or supermarkets an important element of this strategy is to carry only those products on which costco can provide its members significant cost savings items that members may request but that cannot be purchased at prices low enough to pass along meaningful cost savings are often not carried costco seeks to limit specific items in each product line to fast selling models sizes and colors therefore the company carries an average of approximately 4000 active stockkeeping units “sku’s” per warehouse in its core warehouse business as opposed to discount retailers and supermarkets that normally stock 40000 to 60000 sku’s or more these practices are consistent with costco’s membership policies of satisfying both the business and personal shopping needs of its wholesale members thereby encouraging high volume shopping many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only appliances equipment and tools often feature commercial and professional models in keeping with its policy of customer satisfaction costco’s policy is to accept returns of merchandise 

  

the following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by each major category of items sold by costco during fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

   

item 1—business continued 

  

costco has direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise no significant portion of merchandise is obtained by costco from any one of these or any other single supplier costco has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believes that if one or more of its current sources of supply became unavailable it would be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of its business costco may also purchase selected private label merchandise of the same product as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the savings to its members are greater

competition 

  

the company operates in the rapidly changing and highly competitive merchandising industry when the price company pioneered the membership warehouse club concept in 1976 the dominant companies selling comparable lines of merchandise were department stores grocery stores and traditional wholesalers since then new merchandising concepts and aggressive marketing techniques have led to a more intense and focused competitive environment walmart has become the largest retailer in the united states and the world and has expanded further into various food merchandising formats target and kohl’s have also emerged as significant retail competitors over 1100 warehouse club locations exist across the us and canada including the 403 warehouses operated by the company in north america and every major metropolitan area has one if not several club operations lowcost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such as lowe’s home depot office depot petsmart staples best buy and barnes  noble have significant market share in their categories new forms of retailing involving modern technology are boosting sales in certain stores while home shopping and electronic commerce over the internet is becoming increasingly popular 

  

regulation 

  

certain state laws require that the company apply minimum markups to its selling prices for specific goods such as tobacco products and alcoholic beverages while compliance with such laws may cause the company to charge somewhat higher prices than it otherwise would charge other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions and the company believes that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on its operations 

  

it is the policy of the company to sell at lower than manufacturers’ suggested retail prices some manufacturers attempt to maintain the resale price of their products by refusing to sell to the company or to other purchasers that do not adhere to suggested retail prices or that otherwise sell at discounted prices to date the company believes that it has not been materially affected by its inability to purchase directly from such manufacturers both federal and state legislation is proposed from time to time which if enacted would restrict the company’s ability to purchase goods or extend the application of laws enabling the establishment of minimum prices the company cannot predict the effect on its business of the enactment of such federal or state legislation 

  

certain states counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including the company within their jurisdictions the company believes that if enacted such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations

net sales 

  

net sales increased 100 to 51862072 in fiscal 2005 from 47145712 in fiscal 2004 approximately 71 of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year the balance of the increase was due to opening 16 new warehouses during fiscal 2005 and 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004 a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales net sales were reduced by the implementation of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 0310 “application of issue no 0216 “accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a

for fiscal 2005 comparable sales increased 7 from fiscal 2004 had eitf 0310 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2004 the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2005 would have been 8 

  

changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases with the exception of gasoline where price increases accounted for approximately 89 basis points of the sales increase in addition translation of foreign sales into us dollars contributed to the increase in sales due to stronger foreign currencies accounting for approximately 134 basis points yearoveryear of the comparable sales increase 

  

membership fees 

  

membership fees increased 116 to 1073156 or 207 of net sales in fiscal 2005 from 961280 or 204 of net sales in fiscal 2004 this increase was primarily due to additional membership signups at the 16 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2005 increased penetration of the company’s executive membership and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years currently 86 

  

gross margin 

  

gross margin increased 91 to 5515111 or 1063 of net sales in fiscal 2005 from 5053696 or 1072 of net sales in fiscal 2004 the nine basis point decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflected a decrease of three basis points in gross margin in the company’s merchandise departments the three basis point decrease in merchandising is largely due to changes in the sales mix with higher penetration of lower margin departments this effect was offset by gross margin gains in most of the company’s merchandise departments as well as the international operations gross margin as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted by five basis points due to the implementation of eitf 0310 whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced equally the gross margin percentage was reduced by 10 basis points due to the increased penetration of the executive member program increased spending by executive members and the resulting increases in the related costs 

  

the gross margin figures reflect accounting for most us merchandise inventories on the lastin firstout lifo method fiscal 2005 included a 13410 lifo charge increase in merchandise costs while fiscal 2004 included a 6090 lifo charge the impact of the lifo adjustment on a yearoveryear basis negatively impacted gross margin as a percentage of sales by one additional basis point

selling general and administrative sga expenses increased 97 to 5044341 or 973 of net sales in fiscal 2005 from 4597877 or 975 of net sales in fiscal 2004 had eitf 0310 been in effect for all of fiscal 2004 sga expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of four basis points in fiscal 2005 

  

for fiscal 2005 warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted sga comparisons yearoveryear by approximately 13 basis points primarily due to improved payroll utilization at the warehouse level including increased leverage from increased comparable sales and cost control measures employed in employee 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

benefits primarily health care this improvement was partially offset by the implementation of eitf 0310 which negatively impacted sga as a percentage of net sales by five basis points and an increase in stockbased compensation costs approximating six basis points yearoveryear

interest expense 

  

interest expense totaled 34437 in fiscal 2005 compared to 36651 in fiscal 2004 interest expense in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 includes interest on the 3 1  2  zero coupon notes 7 1  8  and 5 1  2  senior notes and on balances outstanding under the company’s bank credit facilities and promissory notes the decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest on the company’s 3 1  2  zero coupon notes as note holders converted approximately 280811 in principle amount of the notes into common stock during fiscal 2005 additionally capitalized interest increased yearoveryear as interest rates and construction costs increased in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 these decreases were partially offset by increases in interest on the senior notes as these fixed rate instruments were swapped into variable rate debt in november 2001 and march 2002 which was mitigated by the fact that the 7 1  8  senior notes matured and were repaid on june 15 2005 

  

interest income and other 

  

interest income and other totaled 109096 in fiscal 2005 compared to 51627 in fiscal 2004 the increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher cash and cash equivalents balances and shortterm investments on hand throughout fiscal 2005 as well as higher interest rates earned on the balances as compared to fiscal 2004

provision for income taxes 

  

the effective income tax rate on earnings was 314 in fiscal 2005 and 37 in fiscal 2004 the decrease in the effective income tax rate is attributable to a onetime 54155 income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the united states and canada covering the years 19962003 and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of 20592 excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 was 362 

  

for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2004 the effective tax rate was 289 and 370 respectively the decrease in the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to the net tax benefit of 20592 noted above and a tax benefit of 13895 primarily associated with lower state taxes the state tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a reduction in the estimated effective state tax rate utilized in the first through third quarters of fiscal 2005 excluding the benefit of these two items the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 would be 358

changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases with the exception of gasoline where price increases accounted for a sales increase of approximately 70 basis points in addition due to the weaker us dollar throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 translation of foreign sales into us dollars contributed to the increase in sales accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately 190 basis points yearoveryear sales were also positively impacted by the supermarket strikes in southern california during the first half of the company’s 2004 fiscal year the positive impact to sales for the entire fiscal year was estimated to be 35 to 50 basis points

 item 1—business 

  

costco wholesale corporation “costco” or the “company” began operations in 1983 in seattle washington in october 1993 costco merged with the price company which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept in 1976 to form pricecostco inc a delaware corporation in january 1997 after the spinoff of most of its nonwarehouse assets to price enterprises inc the company changed its name to costco companies inc on august 30 1999 the company reincorporated from delaware to washington and changed its name to costco wholesale corporation which trades on the nasdaq under the symbol “cost” 

  

general 

  

costco operates membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover this rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities enables costco to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers discount retailers and supermarkets 

  

costco buys the majority of its merchandise directly from manufacturers for shipment either directly to costco’s selling warehouses or to a consolidation point “depot” where various shipments are combined so as to minimize freight and handling costs as a result costco eliminates many of the costs associated with multiple step distribution channels which include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers use of central receiving storing and distributing warehouses and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor by providing this more costeffective means of distributing goods costco meets the needs of business customers who otherwise would pay a premium for small purchases and for the distribution services of traditional wholesalers and who cannot otherwise obtain the full range of their product requirements from any single source in addition these business members will often combine personal shopping with their business purchases the cost savings on brand name and selected private label merchandise are the primary motivation for individuals shopping for their personal needs costco’s merchandise selection is designed to appeal to both the business and consumer requirements of its members by offering a wide range of nationally branded and selected private label products often in case carton or multiplepack quantities at attractively low prices 

  

because of its high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover costco generally has the opportunity to receive cash from the sale of a substantial portion of its inventory at mature warehouse operations before it is required to pay all its merchandise vendors even though costco takes advantage of early payment terms to obtain payment discounts as sales in a given warehouse increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid a greater percentage of the inventory is financed through payment terms provided by vendors rather than by working capital 

  

costco’s typical warehouse format averages approximately 139000 square feet floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space in the handling of merchandise and in the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the availability of low prices on brand name and selected private label goods costco’s warehouses need not be located on prime commercial real estate sites or have elaborate facilities 

  

by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of its warehouses and using a membership format costco has been able to limit inventory losses to approximately twotenths of one percent of net sales—well below those of typical discount retail operations losses associated with dishonored checks have also been minimal and bank information from business members is verified prior to establishing a check purchase limit members are identified and prevented from cashing checks at the point of sale when they have presented dishonored checks to costco 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

costco’s policy is generally to limit marketing and promotional expenses to new warehouse openings occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and direct marketing programs to existing members promoting selected merchandise these practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical discount retailers and supermarkets in connection with new warehouse openings costco’s marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members these contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening potential gold star individual members are contacted by direct mail or by providing such mailings to be distributed through employee associations and other entities after a membership base is established in an area most new memberships result from wordofmouth advertising followup contact by direct mail distributed through regular payroll or other organizational communications to employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective wholesale members 

  

costco’s warehouses generally operate on a sevenday 68hour week and are open somewhat longer during the holiday season generally warehouses are open weekdays between 1000 am and 830 pm with earlier closing hours on the weekend gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional wholesalers discount retailers and supermarkets and due to other operational efficiencies inherent in a warehousetype operation labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking in addition sales are processed through centralized automated checkout stands most items are not individually pricemarked rather each item is barcoded so it can be scanned into electronic cash registers this allows price changes without remarking merchandise substantially all manufacturers provide merchandise premarked with the item numbers and bar codes and many provide special larger package sizes 

  

costco’s merchandising strategy is to provide the customer with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than could be obtained through traditional wholesalers discount retailers or supermarkets an important element of this strategy is to carry only those products on which costco can provide its members significant cost savings items that members may request but that cannot be purchased at prices low enough to pass along meaningful cost savings are often not carried costco seeks to limit specific items in each product line to fast selling models sizes and colors therefore the company carries an average of approximately 4000 active stockkeeping units “sku’s” per warehouse in its core warehouse business as opposed to discount retailers and supermarkets that normally stock 40000 to 60000 sku’s or more these practices are consistent with costco’s membership policies of satisfying both the business and personal shopping needs of its wholesale members thereby encouraging high volume shopping many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only appliances equipment and tools often feature commercial and professional models in keeping with its policy of customer satisfaction costco’s policy is to accept returns of merchandise within a reasonable time after purchase 

  

the following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by each major category of items sold by costco during fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

   

item 1—business continued 

  

costco has direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise no significant portion of merchandise is obtained by costco from any one of these or any other single supplier costco has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believes that if one or more of its current sources of supply became unavailable it would be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of its business costco may also purchase selected private label merchandise of the same product as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the savings to its members are greater 

  

financial information of the company’s segments and geographic areas is included in note 9 segment reporting to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

  

costco reports on a 5253week fiscal year consisting of thirteen fourweek periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august the first second and third quarters consist of three periods each and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53week year there is no material seasonal impact on costco’s operations except an increased level of sales and earnings during the christmas holiday season fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 all consisted of 52 weeks 

  

membership policy 

  

costco’s membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue costco has two primary types of members business and gold star individual members in addition the company offers an executive membership program to both business and gold star members 

  

businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or other evidence of business existence may become business members costco promotes business membership through its merchandise selection and its membership marketing programs business members generally pay an annual membership fee of 45 for the primary and spouse membership card with addon membership cards available for an annual fee of 35 including a free spouse card 

  

individual memberships gold star memberships are available to employees of federal state and local governments financial institutions corporations utility and transportation companies public and private educational institutions other organizations and to other persons individual members generally pay an annual membership fee of 45 which includes a spouse card 

  

executive memberships are available to all members for an annual fee of 100 the executive membership program offers members additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services offered by costco such as merchant credit card processing small business loans auto and home insurance longdistance telephone service check printing and real estate and mortgage services the services offered are generally provided by thirdparty providers and vary by state in addition executive members qualify for a 2 reward which can be redeemed at costco warehouses up to a maximum of 500 per year on all qualified purchases made at costco 

  

as of august 29 2004 costco had approximately 48 million primary business memberships and approximately 150 million gold star memberships included within this membership base are approximately 29 million members that have upgraded to the executive membership program members can utilize their memberships at any costco warehouse location

item 1—business continued 

  

competition 

  

the company operates in the rapidly changing and highly competitive merchandising industry when the price company pioneered the membership warehouse club concept in 1976 the dominant companies selling comparable lines of merchandise were department stores grocery stores and traditional wholesalers since then new merchandising concepts and aggressive marketing techniques have led to a more intense and focused competitive environment walmart has become the largest retailer in the united states and the world and has expanded further into various food merchandising formats target has also emerged as a significant retail competitor over 1100 warehouse club locations exist across the us and canada including the 390 warehouses operated by the company in north america and every major metropolitan area has one if not several club operations lowcost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such as lowe’s home depot office depot petsmart toysrus best buy circuit city and barnes  noble have significant market share in their categories new forms of retailing involving modern technology are boosting sales in certain stores while home shopping and electronic commerce over the internet is becoming increasingly popular likewise in the institutional food business companies such as smart  final which operates predominately in california washington oregon and arizona are capturing an increasingly greater share of the institutional food business from wholesale operators and others 

  

regulation 

  

certain state laws require that the company apply minimum markups to its selling prices for specific goods such as tobacco products and alcoholic beverages while compliance with such laws may cause the company to charge somewhat higher prices than it otherwise would charge other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions and the company believes that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on its operations 

  

it is the policy of the company to sell at lower than manufacturers’ suggested retail prices some manufacturers attempt to maintain the resale price of their products by refusing to sell to the company or to other purchasers that do not adhere to suggested retail prices or that otherwise sell at discounted prices to date the company believes that it has not been materially affected by its inability to purchase directly from such manufacturers both federal and state legislation is proposed from time to time which if enacted would restrict the company’s ability to purchase goods or extend the application of laws enabling the establishment of minimum prices the company cannot predict the effect on its business of the enactment of such federal or state legislation 

  

certain states counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including the company within their jurisdictions the company believes that if enacted such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations

in november 2003 the eitf reached consensus on issue no 0310 “application of issue no 0216 by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers” with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendor’s sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales these rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after november 25 2003 and therefore apply to such transactions starting with the company’s fiscal third quarter of 2004 which began february 16 2004 the adoption of eitf 0310 did not affect the company’s consolidated gross profit or net income but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount for fiscal 2004 net sales and merchandise costs have been reduced by 334065 had the company’s comparable periods in fiscal 2003 and 2002 been reported under eitf 0310 guidance the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by 282288 and 248155 respectively 

  

item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

continued 

  

in november 2002 the eitf reached consensus on certain issues discussed in issue no 0216 “accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor” with respect to determining how a reseller should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement requirements for recognizing volumebased rebates are effective for arrangements entered into or modified after november 21 2002 and resellers with other supplier payments should generally apply the new rules prospectively for agreements entered into or modified after december 31 2002 the adoption of this consensus by the company in fiscal 2003 did not have a significant impact on the company on an annual basis but resulted in a change in the timing for the recognition of some vendor allowances for certain agreements entered into subsequent to december 31 2002 and extends the recognition time frame beyond that which was in effect for similar contracts entered into prior to december 31 2002 net income for fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by approximately 2808 aftertax due to the adoption of eitf 0216 

  




 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates as a policy the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

the nature and amount of the company’s long and shortterm debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors as of august 29 2004 the company’s fixed rate longterm debt includes its 851648 principal amount at maturity zero coupon subordinated notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling 130561 the company’s debt also includes 300000 7 1  8  senior notes and 300000 5 1  2  senior notes the company has entered into “fixedtofloating” interest rate swaps on the senior notes effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt 

  

the company holds interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments shortterm investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as shortterm based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations as the majority of these instruments are of a shortterm nature if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments for those instruments that are classified as available for sale the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss based on the company’s cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments balances at august 29 2004 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately 27000 to interest income pretax on an annual basis 

  

most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies limiting the company’s exposure to changes in currency rates the company periodically enters into shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at august 29 2004 was not material to the company’s results of operations or its financial position

 item 1—business 

  

costco wholesale corporation “costco” or the “company” began operations in 1983 in seattle washington in october 1993 costco merged with the price company which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept in 1976 to form pricecostco inc a delaware corporation in january 1997 after the spinoff of most of its nonwarehouse assets to price enterprises inc the company changed its name to costco companies inc on august 30 1999 the company reincorporated from delaware to washington and changed its name to costco wholesale corporation which trades on the nasdaq under the symbol “cost” 

  

general 

  

costco operates membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover this rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities enables costco to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers discount retailers and supermarkets 

  

costco buys nearly all of its merchandise directly from manufacturers for shipment either directly to costco’s selling warehouses or to a consolidation point “depot” where various shipments are combined so as to minimize freight and handling costs as a result costco eliminates many of the costs associated with multiple step distribution channels which include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers use of central receiving storing and distributing warehouses and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor by providing this more costeffective means of distributing goods costco meets the needs of business customers who otherwise would pay a premium for small purchases and for the distribution services of traditional wholesalers and who cannot otherwise obtain the full range of their product requirements from any single source in addition these business members will often combine personal shopping with their business purchases the cost savings on brand name and selected private label merchandise are the primary motivation for individuals shopping for their personal needs costco’s merchandise selection is designed to appeal to both the business and consumer requirements of its members by offering a wide range of nationally branded and selected private label products often in case carton or multiplepack quantities at attractively low prices 

  

because of its high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover costco generally has the opportunity to receive cash from the sale of a substantial portion of its inventory at mature warehouse operations before it is required to pay all its merchandise vendors even though costco takes advantage of early payment terms to obtain payment discounts as sales in a given warehouse increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid a greater percentage of the inventory is financed through payment terms provided by vendors rather than by working capital 

  

costco’s typical warehouse format averages approximately 139000 square feet floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space in the handling of merchandise and in the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the availability of low prices on brand name and selected private label goods costco’s warehouses need not be located on prime commercial real estate sites or have elaborate facilities 

  

by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of its warehouses and using a membership format costco has been able to limit inventory losses to approximately twotenths of one percent of net sales—well below those of typical discount retail operations losses associated with dishonored checks have also been minimal and bank information from business members is verified prior to establishing a check purchase limit members are identified and prevented from cashing checks at the point of sale when they have presented dishonored checks to costco 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

costco’s policy is generally to limit marketing and promotional expenses to new warehouse openings occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and annual direct mail marketing programs to existing members promoting selected merchandise these practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical discount retailers and supermarkets in connection with new warehouse openings costco’s marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members these contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening potential gold star individual members are contacted by direct mail or by providing such mailings to be distributed through employee associations and other entities after a membership base is established in an area most new memberships result from wordofmouth advertising followup contact by direct mail distributed through regular payroll or other organizational communications to employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective wholesale members 

  

costco’s warehouses generally operate on a sevenday 68hour week and are open somewhat longer during the holiday season generally warehouses are open weekdays between 1000 am and 830 pm with earlier closing hours on the weekend gasoline operations generally have extended hours because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional discount grocery retailers and supermarkets labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking in addition sales are processed through centralized automated checkout stands most items are not individually pricemarked rather each item is barcoded so it can be scanned into electronic cash registers this allows price changes without remarking merchandise substantially all manufacturers provide merchandise premarked with the item numbers and bar codes and many provide special larger package sizes 

  

costco’s merchandising strategy is to provide the customer with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than could be obtained through traditional wholesalers discount retailers or supermarkets an important element of this strategy is to carry only those products on which costco can provide its members significant cost savings items that members may request but that cannot be purchased at prices low enough to pass along meaningful cost savings are often not carried costco seeks to limit specific items in each product line to fast selling models sizes and colors therefore the company carries an average of only 3700 to 4500 active stockkeeping units “sku’s” per warehouse in its core warehouse business as opposed to discount retailers and supermarkets that normally stock 40000 to 60000 sku’s or more these practices are consistent with costco’s membership policies of satisfying both the business and personal shopping needs of its wholesale members thereby encouraging high volume shopping many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only appliances equipment and tools often feature commercial and professional models costco’s policy is generally to accept returns of merchandise within a reasonable time after purchase 

  

the following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by each major category of items sold by costco during fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

   

item 1—business continued 

  

costco has direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise no significant portion of merchandise is obtained by costco from any one of these or any other single supplier costco has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believes that if one or more of its current sources of supply became unavailable it would be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of its business costco may also purchase selected private label merchandise of the same product as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the savings to its members are greater 

  

costco reports on a 5253week fiscal year consisting of 13 fourweek periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august the first second and third quarters consist of three periods each and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53week year there is no material seasonal impact on costco’s operations except an increased level of sales and earnings during the christmas holiday season fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 all consisted of 52 weeks 

  

membership policy 

  

costco’s membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue costco has two primary types of members business and gold star individual members in addition the company offers an executive membership program to both business and gold star members 

  

businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or other evidence of business existence may become business members costco promotes business membership through its merchandise selection and its membership marketing programs business members generally pay an annual membership fee of 45 for the primary and spouse membership card with addon membership cards available for an annual fee of 35 including a free spouse card 

  

individual memberships are available to employees of federal state and local governments financial institutions corporations utility and transportation companies public and private educational institutions other organizations and to other persons individual members generally pay an annual membership fee of 45 which includes a spouse card 

  

executive memberships are available to all members for an annual fee of 100 the executive membership program offers members additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services offered by costco such as merchant credit card processing small business loans auto and home insurance longdistance telephone service check printing and real estate and mortgage services the services offered are generally provided by thirdparty providers and vary by state in addition executive members qualify for a 2 reward which can be redeemed at costco warehouses up to a maximum of 500 per year on all qualified purchases made at costco 

  

as of august 31 2003 costco had approximately 46 million primary business memberships and approximately 150 million gold star memberships members can utilize their memberships at any costco warehouse location

the company operates in the rapidly changing and highly competitive merchandising industry when the price company pioneered the membership warehouse club concept in 1976 the dominant companies selling 

  

item 1—business continued 

  

comparable lines of merchandise were department stores grocery stores and traditional wholesalers since then new merchandising concepts and aggressive marketing techniques have led to a more intense and focused competitive environment walmart has become the largest retailer in the united states and the world and has expanded further into various food merchandising formats target has also emerged as a significant retail competitor approximately 1050 warehouse club locations exist across the us and canada including the 370 warehouses operated by the company in north america and every major metropolitan area has one if not several club operations lowcost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such as home depot office depot petsmart toysrus circuit city and barnes  noble have significant market share in their respective categories new forms of retailing involving modern technology are boosting sales in certain stores while home shopping and electronic commerce over the internet is becoming increasingly popular likewise in the institutional food business companies such as smart  final which operates predominately in california washington oregon florida and arizona are capturing an increasingly greater share of the institutional food business from wholesale operators and others 

  

regulation 

  

certain state laws require that the company apply minimum markups to its selling prices for specific goods such as tobacco products and alcoholic beverages while compliance with such laws may cause the company to charge somewhat higher prices than it otherwise would charge other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions and the company believes that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on its operations 

  

it is the policy of the company to sell at lower than manufacturers’ suggested retail prices some manufacturers attempt to maintain the resale price of their products by refusing to sell to the company or to other purchasers that do not adhere to suggested retail prices or that otherwise sell at discounted prices to date the company believes that it has not been materially affected by its inability to purchase directly from such manufacturers both federal and state legislation is proposed from time to time which if enacted would restrict the company’s ability to purchase goods or extend the application of laws enabling the establishment of minimum prices the company cannot predict the effect on its business of the enactment of such federal or state legislation 

  

certain states counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including the company within their jurisdictions the company believes that if enacted such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations

net sales increased 10 to 41692699 in fiscal 2003 from 37993093 in fiscal 2002 approximately 55 of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year and approximately 45 of the increase was due to opening a net of 23 new warehouses 29 opened 6 closed during fiscal 2003 and a net of 29 new warehouses 35 opened 6 closed during fiscal 2002 a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales with the exception of gasoline which accounted for a comparable sales increase of approximately 70 basis points changes in prices of merchandise did not materially contribute to sales increases in addition due to the weaker us dollar translation of foreign sales into us dollars contributed to the increase in sales accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately one percent yearoveryear comparable sales increased at a 5 annual rate in fiscal 2003 compared to a 6 annual rate during fiscal 2002 

  

membership fees and other revenue increased 11 to 852853 or 205 of net sales in fiscal 2003 from 769406 or 203 of net sales in fiscal 2002 this increase was primarily due to additional membership signups at the 23 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2003 and increased penetration of the company’s executive membership overall member renewal rates remained consistent with the prior year currently at 86

the effective income tax rate on earnings was 3775 in fiscal 2003 and 3850 in fiscal 2002 the decrease in the effective income tax rate yearoveryear is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations

selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 941 during fiscal 2002 from 917 during fiscal 2001 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily due to higher expense ratios at new warehouses where such expense ratios to sales are typically higher than at more mature warehouses and also due to increases in salary healthcare and workers’ compensation costs

interest expense totaled 29096 in fiscal 2002 and 32024 in fiscal 2001 the decrease is primarily attributable to the retirement in april 2001 of a 140000 unsecured note payable to banks and to the interest rate reduction on the company’s 300000 7 1  8  senior notes resulting from interest rate swap agreements entered into effective november 13 2001 converting the interest rate from fixed to floating this decrease in interest expense was partially offset by a reduction in interest capitalized related to warehouse construction as the company had fewer construction projects in progress during the fiscal 2002 period and the weighted average capitalized interest rate was lower than in fiscal 2001 the decrease in interest expense was also offset by the issuance of the 300000 5 1  2  senior notes issued in march 2002 and simultaneously swapped to floating and increased interest expense related to the zero coupon subordinated notes as accrued interest is accreted into principal 

  

interest income and other totaled 35745 in fiscal 2002 compared to 43238 in fiscal 2001 the decrease primarily reflects lower interest income due to lower interest rates and lower daily cash and shortterm investment balances on hand throughout fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 this was partially offset by increased yearoveryear earnings in costco mexico the company’s 50owned joint venture

 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk 

  

the company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and currency rates as a policy the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

the nature and amount of the company’s long and shortterm debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors as of august 31 2003 the company’s fixed rate longterm debt includes its 851860 principal amount at maturity zero coupon subordinated notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling 137761 the company’s debt also includes 300000 7 1  8  senior notes and 300000 5 1  2  senior notes the company has entered into “fixedtofloating” interest rate swaps on the senior notes effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt 

  

the company holds interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents as these investments are of a shortterm nature if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments in addition changes in interest rates would not likely have a material impact on interest income 

  

most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies limiting the company’s exposure to changes in currency rates the company periodically enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at august 31 2003 was not material to the company’s results of operations or its financial position

 item 1—business 

  

costco wholesale corporation “costco” or the “company” began operations in 1983 in seattle washington in october 1993 costco merged with the price company which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept in 1976 to form pricecostco inc a delaware corporation in january 1997 after the spinoff of most of its nonwarehouse assets to price enterprises inc the company changed its name to costco companies inc on august 30 1999 the company reincorporated from delaware to washington and changed its name to costco wholesale corporation which trades on the nasdaq under the symbol “cost” 

  

general 

  

costco operates membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover this rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in nofrills selfservice warehouse facilities enables costco to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers discount retailers and supermarkets 

  

costco buys nearly all of its merchandise directly from manufacturers for shipment either directly to costco’s selling warehouses or to a consolidation point “depot” where various shipments are combined so as to minimize freight and handling costs as a result costco eliminates many of the costs associated with multiple step distribution channels which include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers use of central receiving storing and distributing warehouses and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor by providing this more costeffective means of distributing goods costco meets the needs of business customers who otherwise would pay a premium for small purchases and for the distribution services of traditional wholesalers and who cannot otherwise obtain the full range of their product requirements from any single source in addition these business members will often combine personal shopping with their business purchases the cost savings on brand name and selected private label merchandise are the primary motivation for individuals shopping for their personal needs costco’s merchandise selection is designed to appeal to both the business and consumer requirements of its members by offering a wide range of nationally branded and selected private label products often in case carton or multiplepack quantities at attractively low prices 

  

because of its high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover costco generally has the opportunity to receive cash from the sale of a substantial portion of its inventory at mature warehouse operations before it is required to pay all its merchandise vendors even though costco takes advantage of early payment terms to obtain payment discounts as sales in a given warehouse increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid a greater percentage of the inventory is financed through payment terms provided by vendors rather than by working capital 

  

costco’s typical warehouse format averages approximately 137000 square feet floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space in the handling of merchandise and in the control of inventory because shoppers are attracted principally by the availability of low prices on brand name and selected private label goods costco’s warehouses need not be located on prime commercial real estate sites or have elaborate facilities 

  

by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of its warehouses and by offering membership to selected groups and businesses costco has been able to limit inventory losses to less than threetenths of one percent of net sales—well below those of typical discount retail operations losses associated with dishonored checks have also been minimal since individual memberships are generally limited to members of qualifying groups and bank information from business members is verified prior to establishing a check purchase limit memberships are invalidated at the point of sale for those members who have issued dishonored checks to costco 

item 1—business continued 

  

costco’s policy is generally to limit marketing and promotional expenses to new warehouse openings occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and annual direct mail marketing programs to existing members promoting selected merchandise these practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical discount retailers and supermarkets in connection with new warehouse openings costco’s marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members these contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening potential gold star individual members are contacted by direct mail or by providing such mailings to be distributed through credit unions employee associations and other entities representing individuals who are eligible for gold star membership after a membership base is established in an area most new memberships result from wordofmouth advertising followup contact by direct mail distributed through regular payroll or other organizational communications to employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective wholesale members 

  

costco’s warehouses generally operate on a sevenday 68hour week and are open somewhat longer during the holiday season generally warehouses are open weekdays between 1000 am and 830 pm with earlier closing hours on the weekend because these hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional discount grocery retailers and supermarkets labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking in addition sales are processed through centralized automated checkout stands most items are not individually price marked rather each item is barcoded so it can be scanned into electronic cash registers this allows price changes without remarking merchandise substantially all manufacturers provide merchandise premarked with the item numbers and bar codes and many provide special larger package sizes 

  

costco’s merchandising strategy is to provide the customer with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than could be obtained through traditional wholesalers discount retailers or supermarkets an important element of this strategy is to carry only those products on which costco can provide its members significant cost savings items that members may request but that cannot be purchased at prices low enough to pass along meaningful cost savings are usually not carried costco seeks to limit specific items in each product line to fast selling models sizes and colors therefore the company carries an average of only 3700 to 4500 active stockkeeping units “sku’s” per warehouse in its core warehouse business as opposed to discount retailers and supermarkets that normally stock 40000 to 60000 sku’s or more these practices are consistent with costco’s membership policies of satisfying both the business and personal shopping needs of its wholesale members thereby encouraging high volume shopping many consumable products are offered for sale in case carton or multiplepack quantities only appliances equipment and tools often feature commercial and professional models costco’s policy is generally to accept returns of merchandise within a reasonable time after purchase 

  

the following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by each major category of items sold by costco during fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 

  

 

item 1—business continued 

  

costco has direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise no significant portion of merchandise is obtained by costco from any one of these or any other single supplier costco has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believes that if one or more of its current sources of supply became unavailable it would be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of its business costco may also purchase selected private label merchandise of the same product as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the savings to its members are greater 

  

costco reports on a 5253week fiscal year consisting of 13 fourweek periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august the first second and third quarters consist of three periods each and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53week year there is no material seasonal impact on costco’s operations except an increased level of sales and earnings during the christmas holiday season fiscal years 2002 and 2001 consisted of 52 weeks and fiscal year 2000 consisted of 53 weeks 

  

membership policy 

  

costco’s membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue costco has two primary types of members business and gold star individual members in addition the company offers an executive membership program to both business and gold star members 

  

businesses including individuals with a business license retail sales license or other evidence of business existence may become business members costco promotes business membership through its merchandise selection and its membership marketing programs business members generally pay an annual membership fee of 45 for the primary and spouse membership card with addon membership cards available for an annual fee of 35 including a free spouse card

competition 

  

the company operates in the rapidly changing and highly competitive merchandising industry when the price company pioneered the membership warehouse club concept in 1976 the dominant companies selling comparable lines of merchandise were department stores grocery stores and traditional wholesalers since then new merchandising concepts and aggressive marketing techniques have led to a more intense and focused competitive environment walmart has become the largest retailer in the united states and the world and has expanded further into various food merchandising formats target has also emerged as a significant retail competitor approximately 980 warehouse club locations exist across the us and canada including the 350 warehouses operated by the company in north america and every major metropolitan area has one if not several club operations lowcost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise such as home depot office depot petsmart toysrus circuit city and barnes  noble have significant market share in their respective categories new forms of retailing involving modern technology are boosting sales in certain stores while home shopping and electronic commerce over the internet is becoming increasingly popular likewise in the institutional food business companies such as smart  final which operates predominately in california washington oregon florida and arizona are capturing an increasingly greater share of the institutional food business from wholesale operators and others 

  

regulation 

  

certain state laws require that the company apply minimum markups to its selling prices for specific goods such as tobacco products and alcoholic beverages while compliance with such laws may cause the company to charge somewhat higher prices than it otherwise would charge other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions and the company believes that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on its operations 

  

it is the policy of the company to sell at lower than manufacturers’ suggested retail prices some manufacturers attempt to maintain the resale price of their products by refusing to sell to the company or to other purchasers that do not adhere to suggested retail prices or that otherwise sell at discounted prices to date the company believes that it has not been materially affected by its inability to purchase directly from such manufacturers both federal and state legislation is proposed from time to time which if enacted would restrict the company’s ability to purchase goods or extend the application of laws enabling the establishment of minimum prices the company cannot predict the effect on its business of the enactment of such federal or state legislation 

  

certain states counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs including the company within their jurisdictions the company believes that if enacted such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations

interest expense totaled 29096 in fiscal 2002 and 32024 in fiscal 2001 the decrease is primarily attributable to the retirement in april 2001 of a 140000 unsecured note payable to banks and to the interest rate reduction on the company’s 300000 7 1  8  senior notes resulting from interest rate swap agreements entered into effective november 13 2001 converting the interest rate from fixed to floating this decrease in interest expense was partially offset by a reduction in interest capitalized related to warehouse construction as the company had fewer construction projects in progress during the fiscal 2002 period and the weighted average capitalized interest rate was lower than in fiscal 2001 the decrease in interest expense was also offset by the issuance of the 300000 5 1  2  senior notes issued in march 2002 and simultaneously swapped to floating and increased interest expense related to the zero coupon subordinated notes as accrued interest is accreted into principal 

  

interest income and other totaled 35745 in fiscal 2002 compared to 43238 in fiscal 2001 the decrease primarily reflects lower interest income due to lower interest rates and lower daily cash and shortterm investment balances on hand throughout fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 this was partially offset by increased yearoveryear earnings in costco mexico the company’s 50owned joint venture 

  

the effective income tax rate on earnings was 385 in fiscal 2002 and 40 in fiscal 2001 the decrease in the effective income tax rate yearoveryear is primarily attributable to lower statutory rates for foreign operations the effect of which is expected substantially to continue to impact the effective tax rate on a prospective basis

interest income and other totaled 43238 in fiscal 2001 compared to 54226 in fiscal 2000 the decrease was primarily due to lower rates of interest earned on lower balances of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 which was partially offset by improved earnings from costco mexico a 50 owned joint venture on a yearoveryear basis

in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible longlived assets sfas no 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred sfas no 143 is effective for the company’s 2003 fiscal year the adoption of sfas no 143 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” effective for the company’s 2003 fiscal year this statement supersedes fasb statement no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” and other related accounting guidance the adoption of sfas no 144 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk 

  

the company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and currency rates as a policy the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes

the company holds interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents as these investments are of a shortterm nature and are held until maturity if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments in addition changes in interest rates would not likely have a material impact on interest income 

  

most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies limiting the company’s exposure to changes in currency rates the company periodically enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at september 1 2002 were not material to the company’s results of operations or its financial position
