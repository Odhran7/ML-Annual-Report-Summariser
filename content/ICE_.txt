regulatory changes 

domestic and foreign policy makers continue to review their legal frameworks governing financial markets and periodically change the laws and regulations that apply to our business and to our customers’ businesses our key areas of focus on these evolving efforts are 

• continued access by eu market participants to uk ccps and exchanges  the european commission adopted an 18month temporary equivalence decision for uk ccps which began to apply as of january 1 2021 based on this temporary equivalence ice clear europe has been recognized by esma as a thirdcountry ccp in accordance with the european markets infrastructure regulation or emir in november 2021 the european commission announced that it will propose an extension of the equivalence decision applying to uk ccps in early 2022 in december 2021 esma published its comprehensive review of the systemic importance of ice clear europe 

currently designated as a tier 2 ccp and determined not to issue a recommendation for derecognition esma instead proposed that measures be considered by relevant eu institutions and authorities to mitigate risks related to tier 2 ccp clearing services identified as being of substantial systemic importance to the eu including services provided by ice clear europe esma also proposed regulatory and supervisory measures that incentivize eu clearing participants and clients to reduce their exposures towards tier 2 ccps and enhancements to esma’s supervisory powers 

separately ice futures europe will continue to be able to permit access to its platform from relevant eu jurisdictions and ice endex will continue to be able to permit access to its platform from the uk the absence of an equivalence decision by the eu for uk trading venues however may result in increased costs for certain eu market participants which could impact trading on ice futures europe additional impacts to our business and the potential for regulatory changes remain uncertain at this time 

• regulatory structure applicable to noneu clearing houses on january 1 2020 emir 22 became effective which revises the eus current regulatory and supervisory structure for eu and noneu clearing houses esma has recognized ice clear europe as a thirdcountry ccp under emir and determined that it is a tier 2 ccp on the basis that it is systemically important to the financial stability of the eu or one or more of its member states esma has recognized all other ice clearing houses as thirdcountry ccps and determined that they are tier 1 ccps on the basis that they are not systemicallyimportant to the financial stability of the eu or one or more of its member states esmas continuing implementation of these delegated regulations could still impact one or more of our other noneu clearing houses 

• requirement that european and uk exchanges and ccps offer nondiscriminatory access the nondiscriminatory access provisions of the uks markets in financial instruments directive ii or uk mifid ii and the eu markets in financial instruments directive ii or eu mifid ii required both our uk and eu exchanges and ccps to offer access to third parties on commercially reasonable terms in may 2021 the uk treasury concluded that the nondiscriminatory access requirements for exchangetraded derivatives were not suitable in a ukonly context and the requirements were removed with regard to eu mifid ii in november 2021 the european commission proposed that nondiscriminatory access for exchange traded derivatives be removed from markets in financial instruments or mifir regulation 

• brexit implications as of january 1 2021 eu law no longer applies in and to the uk in connection with the completion of the uks withdrawal from the eu the uk and eu finalized a trade and cooperation agreement which is now in force the trade and cooperation agreement does not cover financial services the eu and uk declared an intention to continue discussions to agree on a memorandum of understanding or mou on financial services cooperation this mou once signed and ratified by both parties will establish a joint ukeu financial regulatory forum which will serve as a platform to facilitate dialogue on financial services issues there continues to be uncertainty surrounding specific terms that may impact the financial services industry and our business operations 

• capital requirements for investment firms acting as market makers eu and uk policy makers are developing a framework for prudential requirements for eu and uk investment firms the proposed rules introduce new prudential requirements tailored to the activities and risks faced by investment firms we are monitoring the potential impact of these new rules on investment firms acting as market makers on certain markets operated by ice futures europe and ice endex 

• financial transaction and similar taxes a number of eu member states have considered a financial transaction tax but many details remain to be discussed and agreed including how to assess the tax at a member state level implementation of a financial transaction tax could result in a reduction in volumes and liquidity which would have a negative impact on our eu operations 

in the us financial transaction taxes and other similar changes to tax laws are being considered in several states and a federal financial transaction tax on stocks bonds and derivatives has been introduced in the us house of representatives as in the eu these types of taxes in the us could result in reduced volumes and liquidity on our exchanges that trade instruments to which the tax applies 

• benchmarks regulation the fca is using its legal powers under the uk bmr to require the london interbank offered rate or libors administrator iba to publish certain sterling and japanese yen libor settings under a changed synthetic methodology until the end of 2022 any settings published under a “synthetic” methodology may no longer be representative of the underlying market or economic reality the setting is intended to measure as those terms are used in the uk bmr the fca confirmed that it expects that certain us dollar libor settings will continue to be published on a representative basis until the end of june 2023 the fca will continue to consider requiring iba to publish certain us dollar libor settings beyond june 30 2023 under a changed “synthetic” methodology usage of the synthetic libor and us dollar libor settings may be restricted or prohibited in certain circumstances under applicable law 

the european commission is using its powers under the eu benchmarks regulation or eu bmr to designate replacement benchmarks for certain swiss franc libor settings and the euro overnight index average or eonia which cover all references to the relevant benchmark the european commission has also announced that it plans to designate replacement benchmarks for certain sterling and japanese yen libor settings the transition period for the use of benchmarks provided by thirdcountry administrators has been extended until at least december 31 2023 

in april 2021 new york state enacted a law designed to reduce uncertainty and economic impacts of the permanent cessation of libor for specified contracts securities and other agreements that are economically linked to libor that are governed by new york state law the new york law generally tracks the legislation proposed by the alternative reference rates committee and received broad industry support 

• us listing and trading prohibitions on certain foreign companies on december 18 2020 the holding foreign companies accountable act became us law for each company required to file periodic reports with the sec this act requires the sec to identify any company that retains a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the public company accounting oversight board or pcaob is unable to inspect or investigate because of a position taken in such foreign jurisdiction on december 16 2021 the pcaob designated china and hong kong as the jurisdictions where the pcaob is not allowed to conduct full and complete audit inspections pursuant to the pcaobs determinations the sec will identify issuers that have used noninspected audit firms if the sec determines that an identified company has used a noninspected audit firm for three consecutive years it is required to prohibit such companys securities from trading on a us securities exchange or in any “overthecounter” market in the us as a consequence the nyse is likely to be required to suspend trading in certain of its listed companies 

on june 3 2021 president biden signed an executive order or the june order that prohibits us persons from purchasing or selling the publicly traded securities of companies determined to be chinese military industrial complex companies or cmics because they i operate in defense and related material sector or the surveillance technology sector of china or ii own or control or are owned or controlled by an individual or entity that operates in such sectors although there are no companies currently listed on the nyse securities exchanges determined to be cmics in the future there may be listed companies covered by the prohibitions

business and industry 

global economic political and financial market events or conditions may negatively impact our business 

adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation supply chain issues labor shortages government shutdowns currency fluctuations interest rate changes increased mortgage foreclosure volume geopolitical events or conflicts international trade disputes including the imposition of tariffs or other protectionist measures actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade have in the past negatively impacted consumer and corporate confidence and resulted in reductions in consumer government and corporate spending and could have such effects in the future and in turn impact our business if our customers reduce spending workforce mortgage origination activity trading activity or demand for financial data as a result of challenges in the prevailing economic markets our revenues could decline 

a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from data services fees and fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets our market databased revenues are largely subscriptionbased or recurring and are generated from a range of global financial and commodity markets including pricing and reference data exchange data analytics feeds index services desktops and connectivity solutions for our transactionbased revenues we derive a significant percentage from trading in global energy and agriculturalrelated futures and options contracts as well as equity transactions and global interest rate contracts the market data subscriptions and trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of spending or trading activity for any reason including 

• adverse market conditions that curtail the addition of new customers or cause a decrease in purchases by our existing customers for our subscriptionbased products and services 

• weakness in the macroeconomic environment that causes our customers to delay or cancel existing orders or subscriptions 

• costcutting pressures across the industry or decrease in demand for our subscriptionbased products and services that lead to a reduction in price 

• consolidation in our markets or the markets of our customers that results in a reduction in the number of market participants 

• a reduction in trading demand by customers or a decision to curtail or cease hedging or speculative trading 

• regulatory or legislative changes impacting our business our customers and financial markets 

• political uncertainty and discord could negatively impact us if we are viewed as taking a political stance that is contrary to our customers beliefs or principles 

• the impact of climate change and the transition to renewable energy and away from crude oil 

• a prolonged decrease in volatility in the financial markets 

• heightened capital and margin requirements or mandated reductions in leverage resulting from new regulations 

• defaults by clearing or exchange members or the inability of participants to pay out contractual obligations 

• changes to our contract specifications that are not viewed favorably by our market participants or 

• reduced access to or availability of capital required to fund trading activities 

a reduction in our overall trading volume could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenues a reduction in trading volumes could also result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for our market data which would further reduce our overall revenue 

further nyse’s revenue increases when more companies are seeking access to public markets and on the nyse specifically a stagnation or a decline in the initial public offering or ipo market or issuers choosing to list on venues other than the nyse could have an adverse effect on our revenues 

us trade and diplomatic tensions us government policies toward china including sanctions laws executive orders and other regulations and chinese government policies toward us companies and chinese companies listed on us exchanges are likely to impact our existing business and future opportunities for example in response to a 2020 executive order by president trump and the june order by president biden in 2021 the nyse delisted four chinese telecommunications companies identified in those executive orders in addition the holding foreign companies accountable act enacted in december 2020 requires the sec to suspend trading in the us of any company whose accounting firm the pcaob is unable to inspect or investigate for three consecutive years the nyse anticipates that the sec could suspend trading in a number of nyselisted companies under this act in the future there may be other listed companies that the nyse will be required to take similar action against to comply with us government policies which could impact our business 

in addition adverse conditions in the residential mortgage lending industry including a substantial or prolonged decline in mortgage lending volume or an increase in mortgage foreclosure volume may increase our costs or have an adverse effect on our revenues mortgage lending volume has decreased substantially in certain years in the past and could again decrease in the future factors that could adversely impact mortgage lending volumes include increased mortgage interest rates reduced consumer and investor demand for mortgages more stringent underwriting guidelines decreased liquidity in the secondary mortgage market high levels of unemployment high levels of consumer debt lower consumer confidence changes in tax and other regulatory policies the number of existing mortgages eligible for refinancing the available inventory of housing affordability of housing and other macroeconomic factors 

owning clearing houses exposes us to risks including risks related to defaults by clearing members risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses 

there are risks inherent in operating clearing houses including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members market liquidity risks defaults by clearing members and risks associated with custody and investing margin or guaranty fund assets provided by clearing members to our clearing houses which could subject our business to substantial losses for example clearing members in ice clear europe have provided margin and guaranty funds with an aggregate cash balance of 982 billion as of december 31 2021 and a total of 1504 billion for all of our clearing houses as of december 31 2021 in addition to the use of sovereign central bank access when applicable the ice clearing houses may use thirdparty investment advisors for investment of cash assets subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house and may add or change the investment managers from time to time to the extent available ice clear credit holds the us dollar cash and us treasuries that clearing members transfer to satisfy their original margin and guaranty fund requirements at its account at the federal reserve with respect to other clearing member cash posted ice clear credit currently selfmanages and uses external investment managers to invest such cash margin and guaranty fund deposits 

we have an obligation to return margin payments and guaranty fund contributions to clearing members to the extent that the relevant member’s risk based on its open contracts to the clearing house is reduced if a number of clearing members substantially reduce their open interest or default the concentration of risks within our clearing houses will be spread 

among a smaller pool of clearing members which would make it more difficult to absorb and manage risk in the event of a further clearing member’s default 

although our clearing houses have policies and procedures to help ensure that clearing members can satisfy their obligations such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a members or counterparty’s default in addition although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards it is a complex process and there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect us from the risks related to clearing these products we cannot assure you these measures and safeguards will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default we have contributed our own capital to the front of the guaranty fund of the clearing houses that could be used in the event of a default we also have default insurance that resides after and in addition to the ice clear credit ice clear europe and ice clear us ‘skin in the game’ contributions and before the guaranty fund contributions of the nondefaulting clearing members notwithstanding these actions the default of any one of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and cause our customers to lose confidence in the guaranty of our clearing houses 

a decline in the value of securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions by our clearing houses or default by a sovereign government issuer could pose additional risks of default by clearing members 

our clearing houses hold a substantial amount of assets as margin or guaranty fund contributions which comprise us and other sovereign treasury securities as of december 31 2021 our clearing houses held 850 billion of noncash margin or guaranty fund contributions in us and other sovereign treasury securities 645 billion of this amount was comprised of us treasury securities 15 billion of french treasury securities 14 billion of german treasury securities 22 billion of uk treasury securities and 154 billion of other european japanese canadian and triparty treasury securities sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest and most liquid securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived credit worthiness of major governments if there is a collapse in a specific currency relied upon by our clearing houses our clearing houses will face significant expenses in changing their systems and such an event could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates to mitigate this risk our clearing houses currently apply a discount or “haircut” to the market values for all sovereign securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions however market conditions could change more quickly than we adjust the amount of the haircuts and the haircuts could be insufficient in the event of a sudden market event 

if the value of these securities declines significantly our clearing houses will need to collect additional margin or guaranty fund contributions from their clearing members which may be difficult for the members to supply in a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government if a clearing member cannot supply the additional margin or guaranty fund contributions which may include cash in a currency acceptable to the clearing house the clearing house would deem the clearing member in default if any clearing members default as a result of the reduction in the value of margin or guaranty fund contributions our clearing houses and trading business could suffer substantial losses as a result of the loss of any capital that has been contributed to the clearing house’s guaranty funds and a loss of confidence by clearing members in the clearing house resulting in a reduction in volumes of future cleared transactions 

further our clearing houses invest large sums through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions in the event that a reverse repo counterparty defaults the value of the sovereign securities we hold as collateral might not be sufficient to cover our losses our clearing houses may also make demand deposits with banks that are secured only to the value of fdic insurance or other national deposit guarantee schemes which is small and therefore the deposits may in significant part be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent 

owning and operating cash equity and options exchanges exposes us to additional risks including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject 

owning and operating cash equity and options exchanges for which the revenues are primarily derived from trading activity market data and listing fees exposes us to additional risks adverse economic conditions and legal and regulatory changes similar to those discussed elsewhere in this section could result in decreased trading volume on our exchanges discourage or prohibit market participants from listing on our exchanges or cause them to forgo new offerings any of these could reduce our revenues including market data and listing fee revenue 

our cash equity and options exchanges also have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled for example these exchanges are responsible for enforcing listed company compliance with applicable listing standards enforcing our members compliance with exchange rules and federal securities laws complying with terms of nms plans filing of all 

material changes to exchanges rules with the sec and operating our exchanges consistent with exchange rules federal securities laws and other applicable laws any failure by one of our exchanges to comply with and enforce compliance by their members with exchange rules and securities laws could significantly harm our reputation prompt regulatory scrutiny result in the payment of fines or penalties and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our ability to do this could be impaired by for example sec amendments to nms plans for the consolidation of market data that impede the ability of the exchanges and finra to discharge their legal obligations by restricting the flow of information and constraining the decisionmaking authority of the exchanges and finra 

we must allocate significant resources to fulfill our regulatory and selfregulatory responsibilities the forprofit exchanges’ goal of maximizing stockholder value might contradict the exchanges’ regulatory and selfregulatory responsibilities in addition the listing of our common stock on the nyse could potentially create a conflict between the exchange’s regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities on the one hand and our commercial and economic interest on the other hand while we have structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful 

further changes in the rules of our securities markets must be reviewed and approved by the sec approval of such changes by the sec cannot be guaranteed and the sec could delay either the approval process or the initiation of the public comment process any denial or delay in approving changes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding regulatory changes impacting our cash equities and options exchanges including risks to our business associated with possible regulation of services offered by nonexchange affiliates and us listing and trading prohibitions on certain foreign companies 

our business is subject to the impact of interest rate levels inflation and financial markets volatility which may be caused by conditions that are beyond our control 

trading volume in our markets and products is largely driven by the degree of volatility  the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations  in prices and levels of the underlying commodities securities indices financial benchmarks or other instruments volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates opportunities for investment and speculative or arbitrage trading were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices or levels of the underlying commodities securities indices benchmarks or other instruments of our products we could experience lower trading volumes slower growth or declines in revenues 

in addition interest rates are a significant factor influencing mortgage loan production volumes rising interest rates are likely to reduce mortgage loan production volumes which could potentially impact our transactionbased revenues 

in the event that inflation increases significantly and persistently this would likely increase the cost of capital resulting in a slowdown of the growth of early stage companies causing companies to stay private longer credit health of market participants may also be impacted increasing the risk of default or companies inability to comply with listing standards an inflationary environment may also reduce consumer optimism resulting in lower demand for mortgage loans 

factors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility and thus trading and mortgage loan production volumes include 

• global economic political and market conditions and 

• concerns over inflation deflation legislative and regulatory changes government fiscal and monetary policy  including actions by the federal reserve and other foreign monetary units governing bodies and investor and consumer confidence levels 

factors that are particularly likely to affect trading volumes include 

• weather conditions including hurricanes and other significant events natural and unnatural disasters like large oil spills that impact the production of commodities and in the case of energy commodities production refining and distribution facilities for oil and natural gas 

• war acts of terrorism and any unforeseen market closures or disruptions in trading 

• political developments impacting international trade including trade disputes and increased tariffs particularly between the us and china and imposition of protectionist measures 

• real and perceived changes in the supply and demand of commodities underlying our products particularly energy and agricultural products including changes as a result of technological improvements or the development of alternative energy sources and 

• credit quality of market participants the availability of capital and the levels of assets under management 

any one or more of these factors which are beyond our control may reduce volumes and trading activity further lower market volatility could also result in more exchanges competing for trading volumes to maintain their growth if any of these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets could be jeopardized because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our current products and services declines for any reason we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues which would cause our net income to decline 

systems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry and mortgage technology industry could negatively impact us 

highprofile system failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry and mortgage technology industry have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our business and result in a loss of confidence in our technology and our markets regulatory investigations fines and penalties and business activity slowdown or interruptions further regulators have imposed requirements for trading platforms that have been costly for us to implement and could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services in particular the sec’s regulation systems compliance and integrity or regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations subject portions of our securities and derivatives trading platforms and other technological systems related to our clearing houses trade repositories and the us swap execution facility or sef to extensive regulation and oversight ensuring our compliance with the requirements of regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations requires significant ongoing administrative and compliance expenses and burdens in addition the sec’s expansion of the ice systems that are determined to be in scope for regulation sci could result in significant additional expenditures 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism including cyberterrorism than other companies 

given our prominence in the global securities industry and the location of many of our properties and personnel in us and european financial centers including lower manhattan and our presence in india abu dhabi and israel we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees in addition terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets including trading on exchanges any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results 

since we conduct operations in a number of countries and regions including the us uk eu canada asia pacific and the middle east substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies could affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

external events such as brexit have caused and may in the future cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially among the us dollar the british pound sterling and the euro if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the uk eu the us or other key markets deteriorate the value of the pound sterling euro or us dollar may weaken further financial instability in a particular country could have a contagion effect on the region in which it is located and contribute to general instability and uncertainty in that region events that adversely affect our 

clients and suppliers in a region could in turn have a materially adverse effect on our international business results and our operating results 

for additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk refer to “ foreign currency exchange rate risk” in item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk which is included in this annual report 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we have achieved significant growth since becoming a public company in 2005 our growth is highly dependent on customer demand for our core products and services favorable economic conditions and our ability to invest in our personnel facilities infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls adverse economic conditions could reduce customer demand for our products and services which may place a significant strain on our management and resources and could force us to defer existing or future planned opportunities we regularly evaluate our existing operations service capacity and business efficiencies and as a result of such evaluations we may undertake strategic initiatives outside of and within our businesses we may not be successful in executing on our strategies to support our growth organically or through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances 

we may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities 

we from time to time launch and intend in the future to launch new products services and business ventures and continue to explore and pursue other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we have spent and may continue to spend substantial time and money developing new product or service offerings or improving current product or service offerings if these offerings are not successful we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to recover the costs of such initiatives obtaining any required regulatory approval associated with these offerings may also result in delays or restrictions on our ability to benefit fully from these offerings further we have entered into and may seek in the future to enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry among other advantages 

in addition in light of consolidation in the exchange data services clearing and mortgage technology sectors and competition for opportunities we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully our competitors could merge making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors also offering new products and services and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives that are necessary for our success 

climate change and the transition to renewable energy and a net zero economy pose operational commercial and regulatory risks 

climate change may increase the frequency or severity of extreme weather events and if we are not adequately resilient to deal with acute climate events our operations either in a particular location or globally may be impacted extreme weather events could also impact the activities of our customers or thirdparty vendors or suppliers the physical commodities and assets underlying certain of our markets may also be impacted by climate change 

in addition the transition to renewable energy and a net zero economy involves changes to consumer and institutional preferences around energy consumption and the possible failure of our products or services to facilitate the needs of customers during the transition to renewable energy could adversely impact our business and revenues changing preferences could also have an adverse impact on the operations or financial condition of our customers which could result in reduced revenues from those customers we are also subject to risks relating to new or heightened climate changerelated regulations or legislation which could impact us and our customers and result in increased regulatory compliance or operational costs we are also subject to reputational risks relating to the perception of whether or not we are facilitating a migration away from fossil fuels for example our reputation could be damaged as a result of our offering certain products or services associated with causing or exacerbating climate change or by any decision by us to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change 

the risks associated with climate change and the transition to renewable energy and a net zero economy are continuing to evolve rapidly and we expect that climate changerelated risks may increase over time 

the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions globally and has led governmental authorities to take unprecedented measures to mitigate the spread of the disease including travel bans border closings business closures quarantines and shelterinplace orders and to take actions designed to stabilize markets and promote economic growth 

from an operational perspective the spread of covid19 has resulted in and could again result in temporary closures of our office facilities and the office facilities of our customers and our thirdparty vendors we have taken preventive measures and implemented contingency plans and currently many of our employees are working remotely however we cannot assure you that such measures will adequately protect our business and an extended period of remote work arrangements could heighten existing and introduce new operational risks including but not limited to cybersecurity risk and could strain our technological resources and business continuity plans if one or more of the thirdparty vendors to whom we outsource certain material activities claim that they cannot perform due to a force majeure or experience operational failures as a result of the covid19 pandemic it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition further although we maintain contingency plans for events such as pandemic outbreaks the further spread of covid19 could impact the availability of our executive officers and other key employees who are necessary to conduct our business the emergence of new covid19 variant strains that are resistant to vaccines or a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines over the long term could impact among other things the availability of our staff and primary facilities and the viability of our customers 

while governmental organizations continue to engage in efforts to combat the spread and severity of covid19 these measures may not be effective moreover actions taken by us or other governmental authorities that were intended to ameliorate the macroeconomic or other effects of covid19 or delays in the announcement or implementation of regulatory measures that had been pending prior to the covid19 pandemic resulted in and may in the future result in regulatory uncertainty and could in turn impact our business 

in addition the spread of covid19 variants along with other factors such as restrictions and limitations on business activities labor shortages at ports and for longhaul transportation rising fuel costs and raw material shortages have resulted in disruptions to global supply chains which has impacted the availability of critical hardware and extended lead times for certain components and systems we require for our operations the covid19 pandemic could continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain hardware and related products for technology that we need to operate our business effectively and efficiently our inability to acquire suitable hardware and related products on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect our business pandemicrelated restrictions could also impact thirdparty providers abilities to meet their contractual obligations to us potentially impacting our operations 

the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments including among other things the effectiveness of vaccines over the long term and against emerging variant strains a prolonged economic downturn could have an adverse effect on our revenues related to certain activities such as a decline in demand for certain data products and a decline in ipos the covid19 pandemic could also have an adverse impact on our customers’ businesses risk management needs and ability to trade in addition to the extent that covid19 may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations it may also heighten other risks described in this section 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill other intangible assets or investments 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2021 we had goodwill of 211 billion and net other intangible assets of 137 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties 

during 2021 we did not record any impairments of our goodwill intangible assets or investments we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may result in these types of impairments an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill other intangible assets and other investments and assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 

for additional information on our goodwill other intangible assets and investments refer to notes 3 4 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements and “ critical accounting policies  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets” in item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which are included in this annual report 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our majority investment in bakkt and the investment may introduce additional risks to our business due to its evolving business model 

we have a majority ownership interest in bakkt which operates as a separate publiclytraded company listed on the nyse due to our majority ownership interest in bakkt we have increased financial and reputational risks if there is a security or system failure a failure to launch one or more products or if bakkts business is unsuccessful it may take longer than expected for us to realize the expected returns from this investment or such returns may ultimately be less than anticipated furthermore our investment in bakkt entails numerous risks including risks relating to bakkt’s ability to 

• manage the complexity of its business model to stay current with the industry 

• successfully enter categories and markets in which it may have limited or no prior experience 

• apply distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets 

• successfully develop and integrate products systems or personnel into its business operations

• maintain technology systems and processes that prevent cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities 

as digital assets and blockchain technologies evolve bakkt may add modify or discontinue certain aspects of its business model relating to the product mix and service offerings future additions and modifications to bakkt’s business will increase the complexity of its business and place significant strain on bakkt’s management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we cannot offer any assurance that these or any other additions or modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to bakkt’s business 

legal and regulatory 

our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to extensive legislation and regulatory scrutiny and we face the risk of changes to our regulatory environment and business in the future 

we are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in many jurisdictions around the world and in particular in the us and the uk we face the risk of significant actions by regulatory and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments which may affect our business the activity of our market participants and our results among other things as a result of regulators and tax authorities enforcing existing laws and regulations we could be censured fined prohibited from pursuing certain acquisitions or engaging in some of our business activities subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities including fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory pricing restrictions also known as frand or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees including settlement payments interest payments and penalty payments in many cases our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions 

the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients’ overall trading volume through our exchanges and demand for our market data and connectivity offerings mortgage technology and other services 

we are also subject to regulatory risks relating to the mortgage industry which is heavily regulated in the us changes to existing laws or regulations or adoption of new laws or regulations that affect the residential mortgage industry could reduce residential mortgage volume or otherwise limit the ability of users and participants of our mortgage technology services to operate their businesses resulting in decreased usage of our solutions alternatively reduced regulatory requirements could also reduce the demand for certain of our products and services which are intended to enable our customers to satisfy existing regulatory requirements potential structural changes in the us residential mortgage industry in particular those involving the roles of fannie mae and freddie mac could disrupt the residential mortgage 

market and have a material adverse effect on our business further as a critical thirdparty service provider in the mortgage industry we are subject to supervision and examination by certain regulators which has resulted in and will continue to result in additional operating costs 

there is ongoing public concern regarding data privacy and data protection in many jurisdictions in which ice operates many of those jurisdictions have passed data privacy legislation with many more contemplating new laws the laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us regulation of privacy and data protection often times require monitoring of and changes to our data practices in regard to the collection use disclosure storage transfer andor security of personal and sensitive information including the personal information of the customers of the users of the software and services provided by our ice mortgage technology business 

these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our stockholders and creditors 

us uk and eu legal and regulatory developments in particular emir emir 22 uk mifid ii and eu mifid ii the uk bmr and the eu bmr including each such regulation as incorporated into uk law and the doddfrank act have significantly altered and propose to further alter the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability these regulatory developments could also cause us to change our business practices restructure our businesses or move certain of our businesses and employees the enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes most likely to affect our businesses are nondiscriminatory access provisions of uk mifid ii and eu mifid ii interoperability and margin rules in emir enhanced regulatory capital liquidity and leverage rules in basel iii and capital requirements directive iv access rules under the uk bmr and eu bmr the nonharmonization of margin requirements implementation of a financial transaction tax access to our benchmarks and maintaining our exchanges’ abilities to operate as sros with related immunity for the discharge of their regulatory functions as the operator of global businesses the lack of harmonization in international financial reform efforts could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in multiple jurisdictions 

the doddfrank act established enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the fsoc ice clear credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the fsoc and as a result is subject to additional oversight by the cftc compliance with these requirements has resulted in and will continue to result in additional operating costs 

in 2016 the sec approved a plan to establish a marketwide consolidated audit trail or cat to improve regulators’ ability to monitor trading activity in 2018 the first phase of implementation went live and required sro participants to begin reporting to the cat in addition to increased risk in connection with our regulatory obligations implementation of the cat could result in significant additional expenditures which may not be reimbursed funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the sros and brokerdealers to date however funding has been provided solely by the sros partly in exchange for promissory notes which increases the risk that sros including us will not be reimbursed for costs expended to date due to the replacement of the original plan processor we recorded promissory note impairment charges of 2 million and 16 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively because the sec has not approved a funding model that shares the cost of the cat between sros and brokerdealers we believe there is a risk that sros are not reimbursed resulting in this impairment until the sec approves a funding model the sros will continue to incur additional costs which may become significant and may not be reimbursed as of december 31 2021 we have accrued approximately 51 million as a receivable in connection with our portion of expenses related to the cat implementation 

there is an increased focus on and scrutiny of esg data and ratings providers by regulators and policymakers regulators and policymakers have indicated that extension of their regulatory oversight to esg data service providers is possible this could result in new or additional regulations applicable to our esg data products and services which could result in additional operating costs 

we are subject to tax laws regulations rulings and audits in multiple us and nonus jurisdictions that could have a significant impact on our business and lead to additional expenditures for us or our customers for example there have been discussions in various jurisdictions around financial transaction or digital service tax frameworks changes to tax frameworks in jurisdictions where we operate significant business for example in new jersey new york the eu or 

federally in the us have the potential to increase costs to us or to our market participants and discourage participation in the markets we operate furthermore implementation of any new or amended tax laws or regulations could impact our global operations trading volumes or financial results 

other enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations 

our compliance and risk management methods as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations might not be effective which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators 

our ability to comply with existing and future rules regulations and laws largely depends on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel regulators periodically review our ability to selfregulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including selfregulatory standards certain of our businesses associated with the nyse are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations policies and procedures if we fail to comply with any of these obligations regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business 

our acquisitions expose us to new regulatory requirements for example as a result of our acquisition of interactive data in 2015 we operate an investment adviser registered with the sec under the investment advisers act in addition our acquisition of the bondpoint ats in january 2018 and our acquisition of tmc bonds in july 2018 exposes us to increased exposure to regulatory scrutiny from the sec finra and msrb our acquisition of ellie mae in 2020 exposes us to increased exposure to regulatory scrutiny from us regulatory bodies which regulate the us residential mortgage industry including the ffiec and its member agencies including among others the cfpb compliance with any such regulatory requirements gives rise to costs and expenses that may be material 

our regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders embargo future business activity or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses we continue to face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity of our business any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our financial condition operating results or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined to be in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business further any settlement consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or regulatory agencies begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities finally the implementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to remain competitive and grow our business 

regulatory changes or court rulings may have an adverse impact on our ability to derive revenue from market data and connectivity fees 

regulatory developments or court rulings could reduce the amount of revenue that we obtain from exchange market data and connectivity fees related to our us equity and options exchanges with respect to our us equities and equity options exchanges our ability to assess fees for market data products and certain connectivity fees are subject to review by the sec there continue to be opposing industry viewpoints and litigation as to the extent that our us equities and equity options exchanges should be able to charge for market data and market access and the manner in which we set such exchange fees could be reassessed 

if new constraints are placed on our ability to charge for market data or market access in the us it could have a negative impact on our revenues we cannot predict whether or in what form any regulatory or other changes will take effect or their impact on our business a determination by the sec or a court for example that the sec must link market data fees to marginal costs take a more active role in the market data ratesetting process or reduce the current levels of market data fees could have an adverse effect on our market data revenues 

separately our european exchanges are currently authorized to sell trade information on a nondiscriminatory basis at a reasonable cost this regulatory position could be modified or interpreted by the european commission or ec or future european court decisions in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our european market data revenues 

in addition the fca and iosco have both issued consultations to explore access to market data in financial markets the results of these consultations may lead to a regulatory response that could affect our business similar to the us if new constraints are placed on our ability to charge for market data or market access in the uk or other jurisdictions it could have a negative impact on our revenues 

the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the uks exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

in 2016 voters in the uk approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit brexit has created political and economic uncertainty and instability in the global markets including currency and credit markets particularly in the uk and eu in addition political and economic uncertainty surrounding the future relationship of the uk and eu could lead to certain macroeconomic conditions that adversely affect our business the longterm effects of brexit will depend in part on the agreement the uk made to retain access to eu markets 

in december 2019 the uk withdrew from the eu on january 31 2020 and completed its withdrawal on january 1 2021 prior to completing its withdrawal in december 2020 the uk and eu agreed to a trade and cooperation agreement which was provisionally applied as of january 1 2021 this agreement governs the euuk relationship after the completion of the uk’s exit from the eu the ukeu brexit deal does not provide a transition period for financial services or any new arrangements to replace the existing “passport” this leaves both the uk and eu to address matters of access in financial services through declarations of equivalence under existing equivalence regimes contained in uk and eu law and through domestic laws the ec has however adopted an 18month temporary equivalence decision for uk ccps which began to apply as of january 1 2021 ice clear europe has been recognized by esma as a thirdcountry ccp in accordance with emir in november 2021 the ec announced that it will propose an extension of the equivalence decision applying to uk ccps in early 2022 

as a result of the uk and eu trade and cooperation agreement not providing free trade arrangements for financial services any equivalence determinations or any further transition period for financial services could include restrictions on access to our services by persons located in the eu or make access more expensive which could adversely affect our operations and profitability or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions the consequences of brexit and the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement could also cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding brexit including risks to our business associated with brexit 

risks relating to the administration of benchmarks and indices including libor and the potential for changes to cessations of and the replacement of or transition from benchmarks and indices including libor may result in legal risks and could adversely affect our business 

certain of our subsidiaries produce and license multiple benchmarks and indices across asset classes which are used globally and are referenced in certain of our trading and clearing products to ensure continued trading and clearing in these benchmarkrelated products and the continued licensing and use of these benchmarks and indices our subsidiaries must be able to demonstrate that these benchmarks and indices are determined with integrity and are not readily subject to manipulation and must also continue to evolve these benchmarks and indices as necessary to maintain their reliability and relevance and continue to administer these benchmarks and indices in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as an example our subsidiary iba is the administrator of various global benchmarks including libor any failures negative publicity or lawsuits related to our subsidiaries administration of benchmarks and indices including libor could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and indices and could harm our business and our reputation 

changes to cessations of and the replacement of or transition from our subsidiaries benchmarks and indices including libor or any other changes or reforms to the determination or administration of such benchmarks and indices could result in legal risks risks to our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results in july 2017 the fca stated its intention that it would no longer be necessary to sustain libor through its influence or legal powers beyond 2021 as a result regulators in multiple jurisdictions have encouraged market participants to transition from using libor to alternative reference rates the publication of most libor settings ceased after december 31 2021 and certain others are scheduled to cease after june 30 2023 

the fca is requiring iba to publish certain libor settings under a changed synthetic methodology during 2022 any settings published under a “synthetic” methodology will no longer be representative of the underlying market or economic reality the setting is intended to measure as those terms are used in the uk bmr any failures negative publicity or lawsuits related to our subsidiaries administration of synthetic libor could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and indices and could harm our business and our reputation 

under the uk bmr the use of continuing libor settings by uksupervised entities in certain regulated contracts and instruments may be restricted or prohibited the use of continuing libor settings in jurisdictions outside the uk and by entities subject to the oversight of other regulatory authorities may also be restricted or prohibited by law in those jurisdictions and by the requirements of such regulatory authorities we continue to monitor industry and regulatory developments in relation to the libor transition and cessation and the resulting impacts on our business and on the markets that use the benchmark today 

we may face liability for content contained in our data products and services 

we have been and may in the future be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation libel copyright or trademark infringement fraud or negligence or based on other theories of liability in each case relating to the data articles commentary ratings information or other content we distribute in our financial data services if such data or other content or information that we distribute has errors is delayed or has design defects we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our corporate website or those websites that we own and operate through links to other websites use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for significant amounts any such claim even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us could involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and a negative impact on our reputation 

in addition we license and redistribute data and content from various thirdparty sources and the terms of these licenses change frequently our thirdparty data and content suppliers may audit our use of and our clients’ use of and payment for data and content from time to time in the ordinary course of business including audits currently underway such thirdparty data and content suppliers have asserted and may in the future assert that we or our clients owe additional amounts under the terms of the applicable license agreements that we inappropriately distributed the thirdparty data or that we or our clients used the data or content in a manner that exceeded the scope of the applicable license agreement or without a license agreement in some instances where we have certain commercial relationships with thirdparties we have assumed the responsibility for this thirdparty source liability we have and expect to continue to spend and allocate resources to develop and acquire the use of technology and other intellectual property rights to manage these risks and track thirdparty data usage but we cannot be assured that we will not incur liability the costs and resources required to investigate any allegations could be material and we may still be required to pay damages to or make unexpected large settlement payments to these data and content suppliers which could also give rise to reputational harm 

we are subject to significant litigation and liability risks 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our participants involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred for example dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platforms or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades abusive trading practices security and confidentiality breaches mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants in addition because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by entering them inaccurately a large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets 

in addition we are subject to ongoing legal disputes that could result in the payment of fines penalties or damages and could expose us to additional liability in the future see item 3 legal proceedings in this annual report for a general description of our legal proceedings and claims and note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for a summary of specific legal proceedings the outcome of any of these legal proceedings that remain unresolved cannot be determined and adverse rulings in these matters could impact our financial condition and continued operations 

further we could incur significant expenses defending the claims mentioned above and any future claims even those without merit which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us including those we are involved with due to acquisition activity may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we may have to establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change 

operational and liquidity 

our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cyberattacks hacking and other cybersecurity risks which could result in wrongful manipulation disclosure destruction or use of our information or that of a third party or which could make our participants unable or reluctant to use our electronic platforms 

the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to reliably transact on our electronic platforms and provide financial data services are critical elements of our operations some of our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential client and other data including client portfolio information or personally identifiable information if anyone gains improper access to our electronic platforms networks or databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify our confidential information or that of a third party breaches of our cybersecurity measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business our networks and those of our participants thirdparty service providers and external market infrastructures may be vulnerable to compromise unauthorized access security technology failure computer viruses social engineering denial of service attacks terrorism ransomware attacks firewall or encryption failures or other security problems resulting in loss of data integrity information disclosure unavailability or fraud the financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of political protest activism and financial gain and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for cyberattack and other information security threats further former employees of companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly 

although we have not been subject to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity events including distributed denial of service or ddos attacks malware infections phishing web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size for example we experienced ddos attempts brand misuse and phishing attempts directed toward employee systems and personal email accounts during 2021 while we operate an information security program that is designed to prevent detect track and mitigate cyber incidents and that has detected and mitigated such incidents in the past we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against future attacks any such attacks could result in reputational damage cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose customers cause us to experience lower current and future trading volumes or incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive position in addition given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or disable or degrade systems a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected and we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely the extent of a particular cyber incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while such an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it which may compound damages before the incident is discovered or remediated additionally as threats continue to evolve and increase and as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities which could adversely impact our net income 

further cybersecurity threats to and incidents involving vendors and other third parties who support our activities  particularly those with lesssophisticated defenses  could impact us for example although we did not experience any material impacts from the log4j security vulnerability that was widely publicized in december 2021 we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may be material 

our business may be harmed by computer and communication systems failures and delays 

our business depends on the integrity reliability and security of our infrastructure which is highly dependent on our computer and communication systems our customers rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate and highquality financial market data analytics and related solutions our timely reliable delivery of highquality products and services is dependent upon an array of technical production processes that enable our content delivery platforms our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans including our ability to recover from the loss of one of our primary data centers may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach our systems or those of our thirdparty providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

• unanticipated disruption in service to our participants 

• slower response time and delays in our participants’ trade execution and processing 

• failed settlement by participants to whom we provide trade confirmation or clearing services 

• incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades 

• failure to complete the clearing house margin settlement process resulting in significant financial risk 

• distribution of inaccurate or untimely market data to participants who rely on this data in their trading activity 

• disruption to ice mortgage technology and loan origination systems and 

• financial loss to us or those who depend on our systems and data 

we have experienced system failures in the past due to telecommunication failures and hardware and software malfunctions and defects and could experience future system failures due to power or telecommunications failures human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyberattacks intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar events these situations could result in damage to our business reputation and participant dissatisfaction with our electronic platform which could prompt participants to trade elsewhere or expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions as a consequence our business financial condition and operating results could suffer materially 

our regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses could be adversely affected 

an interruption or cessation of an important service data or content supplied by any third party or the loss of an exclusive license could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as online service providers hosting service and software providers data processors data centers software and hardware vendors banks local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading clearing data services mortgage technology applications and other systems we rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with third parties and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for the provision of hosting services we also depend on thirdparty suppliers for data and content including data received from certain competitors clients various government and public record services and financial institutions used in our products and services some of this data is exclusive to particular suppliers and may not be obtained from other suppliers in addition our data suppliers could enter into exclusive contracts with our competitors without our knowledge the general trend toward industry consolidation may increase the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future if these companies were to experience difficulties discontinue providing services to us for any reason or be unable to or fail to provide the type of service agreed to for any reason we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines or damage to our reputation it could require a significant amount of time and additional resources to transition to new thirdparty service providers or to enter into new commercial arrangements in order to offset loss of services to our clients our thirdparty data suppliers perform audits on us from time to time in the ordinary course of business to determine if data we license for redistribution has been properly accounted for in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreement as a result of these audits we may incur additional expenses 

many of our clients also rely on third parties to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform if these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients’ inability to transact with our businesses we hold exclusive licenses to list various index futures and contracts in the future litigation or regulatory action may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and contracts trading to a single exchange and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license mifid ii introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of services relating to commodity derivatives across europe and the legislation requires open access to any benchmarks used in europe if unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive license were permitted we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products 

our success largely depends on key personnel including our senior management and having adequate succession plans in place we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business which could harm our business 

our future performance depends in large part on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel including our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel competition for key personnel in the various localities and business segments in which we operate is intense our ability to attract and retain key personnel in particular senior management will be dependent on a number of factors including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent current economic market social and political conditions and the recent reopening of the global economy have increased talent risk which has led to higher employee attrition and made recruitment for certain positions more difficult and could lead to a loss of top performers and make it more difficult to fill key positions for example our inoffice requirements as well as the location of our offices and our remote working arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees including senior management or other key employees or may not be viewed as competitive which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees in addition we operate globally and geopolitical events or conflicts in the countries or regions in which we operate could lead to physical risks to our personnel and disruption to business continuity that could negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy there is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who we rely upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives the loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel could harm our business in particular we have to incur costs to replace senior officers or other key employees who leave and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner or at all 

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and restrict our activities or satisfy our debt service obligations 

as of december 31 2021 we had 139 billion of outstanding debt this level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt service obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our peers and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities as we use our available resources to reduce and refinance our consolidated debt our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue future business opportunities may be further restrained in addition the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio test and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other matters further a portion of our outstanding debt has historically been and continues to be in commercial paper which is subject to interest rate changes rising interest rates will result in an increase in our interest expense we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could materially affect our financial condition 

our longterm and shortterm debt is currently rated by moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s these ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time and it is possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade our credit ratings in the future in particular our inability to sustain reduced debt on a consolidated basis may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings 

a significant downgrade of our credit ratings in the future could impact customers’ willingness to use our clearing houses make parties less willing to do business with us and could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase the cost of our commercial paper and any future debt funding we may obtain 

competition 

we face intense competition failure to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences could negatively impact our competitive position 

we face intense competition in all aspects of our business and our competitors both domestic and international are numerous we currently compete with 

• regulated diversified futures exchanges that offer trading in a variety of asset classes similar to those offered by us such as energy agriculture equity and equity index credit and interest rate derivatives markets and foreign exchange 

• exchanges offering listing and trading of cash equities etfs closedend funds and other structured products similar to those offered by us 

• market data and information vendors 

• providers of digital solutions including providers of mortgage origination compliance pricing and documentation services 

• interdealer brokers active in the global credit derivatives markets 

• existing and newly formed electronic trading platforms service providers and exchanges some of which do not receive the same regulatory scrutiny as established market places 

• other clearing houses and 

• consortiums of our customers members or market participants that may work together to achieve more favorable terms or pool their trading activity to establish new exchanges trading platforms or clearing facilities 

trends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings finally many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and ats businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business some of our competitors may have greater capital and resources offer a wide range of products and services or operate under less stringent regulatory regimes than we do 

in the mortgage technology sector we compete against other software providers as well as companies that offer “point of sale” or webbased online loan applications services we also compete with traditional methods of exchanging data and documents among mortgage industry participants such as email facsimile phone courier and mail mortgage originators may also manually upload loan data or enter information into each investor’s lender’s or service provider’s website in lieu of using our solutions there is vigorous competition among providers of mortgage technology services and we may be unsuccessful in differentiating our services to the extent necessary to effectively compete and may not succeed in convincing potential customers using other services or methods to switch to ours 

we also face pricing competition in many areas of our business a decline in our fees due to competitive pressure or regulatory changes the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for example our data service offerings have benefited from a high renewal rate in its subscriptionbased services but we cannot assure you that this will continue we also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings modify the pricing for our products or retain our current customers or attract new customers if we are not able to compete successfully our business could be materially impacted including our ability to remain as an operating entity 

our success depends on our ability to maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our technology to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary and acquired technology the financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change change in use patterns change in client preferences frequent product and service introductions the emergence of new industry standards and practices and increased consolidation through 

mergers and acquisitions activity that results in new competitors or expanded product offerings by current competitors these changes could render our existing proprietary technology uncompetitive or obsolete 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology to our clients’ requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and costeffective manner any failure to remain abreast of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to client preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our results 

damage to our reputation could damage our business 

our business is highly competitive and our customers typically have options on where to conduct their business our management team and business operations benefit from being highly regarded in our industry maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and for maintaining our relationships with our regulators negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services operations risk management compliance with regulations political affiliations or management team could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our existing business and business prospects 

intellectual property 

our use of open source software could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services and subject us to litigation 

we use some opensource software in our technology most often as small components within a larger product or service to augment algorithms functionalities or libraries we create and we may use more opensource software in the future opensource code is also contained in some thirdparty software we rely on we could be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of the license for such opensource software the terms of many opensource licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us or other courts and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services further opensource licensors generally do not provide technology support maintenance warranties or assurance of title or controls on the origin of the software which can also lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties including trademarks service marks trade names trade secrets copyrights and patents we cannot assure you that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property additionally we may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively further we have resorted to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in the past and may need to in the future which requires significant financial and managerial resources as a result we have chosen not to enforce our infringed intellectual property rights in the past and may choose not to in the future depending on our strategic evaluation and judgment regarding the best use of our resources the relative strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the recourse available to us 

in addition our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained and may obtain in the future patent and intellectual property rights related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents and intellectual property rights that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services as a result we have in the past faced and may in the future face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents and intellectual property rights held by others we may be subject to lawsuits or required to stop developing or marketing the products or services obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the owners of the intellectual property or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the thirdparty intellectual property we also have in the past and could in the future be required to pay damages if we are found to infringe intellectual property rights held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to intellectual property rights held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

common stock 

we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders principal and interest on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock is dividends from our subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may fail to complete or realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our acquisitions or anticipated growth opportunities or expected benefits of our strategic investments which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we have completed many acquisitions and plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to integrate these businesses and realize anticipated cost savings revenue synergies and growth opportunities we generally set aggressive timelines for realizing savings which assumes we successfully undertake a variety of actions including but not limited to integrating technology eliminating redundancies and effecting organizational restructurings that are themselves subject to a variety of risks and may be subject to regulatory approvals that we do not control the process of integrating acquired companies is time consuming and could disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties including inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants regulators and others require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of the business 

there is also a risk that we may not integrate these acquired companies in a manner that permits our expected cost savings and revenue synergies to be fully realized in the time periods expected or at all in addition a variety of factors including but not limited to regulatory conditions governmental competition approvals cultural differences and difficulty integrating technology platforms may adversely affect our ability to complete our acquisitions or realize our anticipated cost savings and synergies 

we may also not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures or alliances that we have entered into or may enter into for a number of reasons including decline in value of the other company regulatory or government approvals or changes global market changes contractual obligations competing products and in some instances our lack of or limited control over the management of the business for example we have a majority ownership interest in bakkt but do not control the management of the business a substantial decline in bakkts financial performance or stock price significant failure to or any major technology failures or cyber attacks could lead to litigation against us and reputational harm that could negatively impact our business and the value of our stock further strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future 

as a result of any future acquisition we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest expend cash incur debt assume actual and contingent liabilities inherit existing or pending litigation or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets further we cannot assure you that any such financing or equity investments will be available with terms that will be favorable to us or available at all 

provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ice 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for ice these provisions make a change of control less likely which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of us and european equity exchanges for example our organizational documents include provisions that generally restrict any person either alone or together with its related persons from i voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10 of our outstanding voting capital stock including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock or ii beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock further our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to call special stockholders’ meetings or act by written consent and generally authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock in addition provisions of delaware law may have a similar 

effect such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders as defined under delaware law from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the board of directors

business and industry 

global economic political and financial market events or conditions may negatively impact our business 

adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation supply chain issues labor shortages government shutdowns currency fluctuations interest rate changes increased mortgage foreclosure volume geopolitical events or conflicts international trade disputes including the imposition of tariffs or other protectionist measures actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade have in the past negatively impacted consumer and corporate confidence and resulted in reductions in consumer government and corporate spending and could have such effects in the future and in turn impact our business if our customers reduce spending workforce mortgage origination activity trading activity or demand for financial data as a result of challenges in the prevailing economic markets our revenues could decline 

a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from data services fees and fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets our market databased revenues are largely subscriptionbased or recurring and are generated from a range of global financial and commodity markets including pricing and reference data exchange data analytics feeds index services desktops and connectivity solutions for our transactionbased revenues we derive a significant percentage from trading in global energy and agriculturalrelated futures and options contracts as well as equity transactions and global interest rate contracts the market data subscriptions and trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of spending or trading activity for any reason including 

• adverse market conditions that curtail the addition of new customers or cause a decrease in purchases by our existing customers for our subscriptionbased products and services 

• weakness in the macroeconomic environment that causes our customers to delay or cancel existing orders or subscriptions 

• costcutting pressures across the industry or decrease in demand for our subscriptionbased products and services that lead to a reduction in price 

• consolidation in our markets or the markets of our customers that results in a reduction in the number of market participants 

• a reduction in trading demand by customers or a decision to curtail or cease hedging or speculative trading 

• regulatory or legislative changes impacting our business our customers and financial markets 

• political uncertainty and discord could negatively impact us if we are viewed as taking a political stance that is contrary to our customers beliefs or principles 

• the impact of climate change and the transition to renewable energy and away from crude oil 

• a prolonged decrease in volatility in the financial markets 

• heightened capital and margin requirements or mandated reductions in leverage resulting from new regulations 

• defaults by clearing or exchange members or the inability of participants to pay out contractual obligations 

• changes to our contract specifications that are not viewed favorably by our market participants or 

• reduced access to or availability of capital required to fund trading activities 

a reduction in our overall trading volume could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenues a reduction in trading volumes could also result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for our market data which would further reduce our overall revenue 

further nyse’s revenue increases when more companies are seeking access to public markets and on the nyse specifically a stagnation or a decline in the initial public offering or ipo market or issuers choosing to list on venues other than the nyse could have an adverse effect on our revenues 

us trade and diplomatic tensions us government policies toward china including sanctions laws executive orders and other regulations and chinese government policies toward us companies and chinese companies listed on us exchanges are likely to impact our existing business and future opportunities for example in response to a 2020 executive order by president trump and the june order by president biden in 2021 the nyse delisted four chinese telecommunications companies identified in those executive orders in addition the holding foreign companies accountable act enacted in december 2020 requires the sec to suspend trading in the us of any company whose accounting firm the pcaob is unable to inspect or investigate for three consecutive years the nyse anticipates that the sec could suspend trading in a number of nyselisted companies under this act in the future there may be other listed companies that the nyse will be required to take similar action against to comply with us government policies which could impact our business 

in addition adverse conditions in the residential mortgage lending industry including a substantial or prolonged decline in mortgage lending volume or an increase in mortgage foreclosure volume may increase our costs or have an adverse effect on our revenues mortgage lending volume has decreased substantially in certain years in the past and could again decrease in the future factors that could adversely impact mortgage lending volumes include increased mortgage interest rates reduced consumer and investor demand for mortgages more stringent underwriting guidelines decreased liquidity in the secondary mortgage market high levels of unemployment high levels of consumer debt lower consumer confidence changes in tax and other regulatory policies the number of existing mortgages eligible for refinancing the available inventory of housing affordability of housing and other macroeconomic factors 

owning clearing houses exposes us to risks including risks related to defaults by clearing members risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses 

there are risks inherent in operating clearing houses including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members market liquidity risks defaults by clearing members and risks associated with custody and investing margin or guaranty fund assets provided by clearing members to our clearing houses which could subject our business to substantial losses for example clearing members in ice clear europe have provided margin and guaranty funds with an aggregate cash balance of 982 billion as of december 31 2021 and a total of 1504 billion for all of our clearing houses as of december 31 2021 in addition to the use of sovereign central bank access when applicable the ice clearing houses may use thirdparty investment advisors for investment of cash assets subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house and may add or change the investment managers from time to time to the extent available ice clear credit holds the us dollar cash and us treasuries that clearing members transfer to satisfy their original margin and guaranty fund requirements at its account at the federal reserve with respect to other clearing member cash posted ice clear credit currently selfmanages and uses external investment managers to invest such cash margin and guaranty fund deposits 

we have an obligation to return margin payments and guaranty fund contributions to clearing members to the extent that the relevant member’s risk based on its open contracts to the clearing house is reduced if a number of clearing members substantially reduce their open interest or default the concentration of risks within our clearing houses will be spread 

among a smaller pool of clearing members which would make it more difficult to absorb and manage risk in the event of a further clearing member’s default 

although our clearing houses have policies and procedures to help ensure that clearing members can satisfy their obligations such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a members or counterparty’s default in addition although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards it is a complex process and there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect us from the risks related to clearing these products we cannot assure you these measures and safeguards will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default we have contributed our own capital to the front of the guaranty fund of the clearing houses that could be used in the event of a default we also have default insurance that resides after and in addition to the ice clear credit ice clear europe and ice clear us ‘skin in the game’ contributions and before the guaranty fund contributions of the nondefaulting clearing members notwithstanding these actions the default of any one of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and cause our customers to lose confidence in the guaranty of our clearing houses 

a decline in the value of securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions by our clearing houses or default by a sovereign government issuer could pose additional risks of default by clearing members 

our clearing houses hold a substantial amount of assets as margin or guaranty fund contributions which comprise us and other sovereign treasury securities as of december 31 2021 our clearing houses held 850 billion of noncash margin or guaranty fund contributions in us and other sovereign treasury securities 645 billion of this amount was comprised of us treasury securities 15 billion of french treasury securities 14 billion of german treasury securities 22 billion of uk treasury securities and 154 billion of other european japanese canadian and triparty treasury securities sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest and most liquid securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived credit worthiness of major governments if there is a collapse in a specific currency relied upon by our clearing houses our clearing houses will face significant expenses in changing their systems and such an event could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates to mitigate this risk our clearing houses currently apply a discount or “haircut” to the market values for all sovereign securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions however market conditions could change more quickly than we adjust the amount of the haircuts and the haircuts could be insufficient in the event of a sudden market event 

if the value of these securities declines significantly our clearing houses will need to collect additional margin or guaranty fund contributions from their clearing members which may be difficult for the members to supply in a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government if a clearing member cannot supply the additional margin or guaranty fund contributions which may include cash in a currency acceptable to the clearing house the clearing house would deem the clearing member in default if any clearing members default as a result of the reduction in the value of margin or guaranty fund contributions our clearing houses and trading business could suffer substantial losses as a result of the loss of any capital that has been contributed to the clearing house’s guaranty funds and a loss of confidence by clearing members in the clearing house resulting in a reduction in volumes of future cleared transactions 

further our clearing houses invest large sums through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions in the event that a reverse repo counterparty defaults the value of the sovereign securities we hold as collateral might not be sufficient to cover our losses our clearing houses may also make demand deposits with banks that are secured only to the value of fdic insurance or other national deposit guarantee schemes which is small and therefore the deposits may in significant part be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent 

owning and operating cash equity and options exchanges exposes us to additional risks including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject 

owning and operating cash equity and options exchanges for which the revenues are primarily derived from trading activity market data and listing fees exposes us to additional risks adverse economic conditions and legal and regulatory changes similar to those discussed elsewhere in this section could result in decreased trading volume on our exchanges discourage or prohibit market participants from listing on our exchanges or cause them to forgo new offerings any of these could reduce our revenues including market data and listing fee revenue 

our cash equity and options exchanges also have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled for example these exchanges are responsible for enforcing listed company compliance with applicable listing standards enforcing our members compliance with exchange rules and federal securities laws complying with terms of nms plans filing of all 

material changes to exchanges rules with the sec and operating our exchanges consistent with exchange rules federal securities laws and other applicable laws any failure by one of our exchanges to comply with and enforce compliance by their members with exchange rules and securities laws could significantly harm our reputation prompt regulatory scrutiny result in the payment of fines or penalties and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our ability to do this could be impaired by for example sec amendments to nms plans for the consolidation of market data that impede the ability of the exchanges and finra to discharge their legal obligations by restricting the flow of information and constraining the decisionmaking authority of the exchanges and finra 

we must allocate significant resources to fulfill our regulatory and selfregulatory responsibilities the forprofit exchanges’ goal of maximizing stockholder value might contradict the exchanges’ regulatory and selfregulatory responsibilities in addition the listing of our common stock on the nyse could potentially create a conflict between the exchange’s regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities on the one hand and our commercial and economic interest on the other hand while we have structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful 

further changes in the rules of our securities markets must be reviewed and approved by the sec approval of such changes by the sec cannot be guaranteed and the sec could delay either the approval process or the initiation of the public comment process any denial or delay in approving changes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding regulatory changes impacting our cash equities and options exchanges including risks to our business associated with possible regulation of services offered by nonexchange affiliates and us listing and trading prohibitions on certain foreign companies 

our business is subject to the impact of interest rate levels inflation and financial markets volatility which may be caused by conditions that are beyond our control 

trading volume in our markets and products is largely driven by the degree of volatility  the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations  in prices and levels of the underlying commodities securities indices financial benchmarks or other instruments volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates opportunities for investment and speculative or arbitrage trading were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices or levels of the underlying commodities securities indices benchmarks or other instruments of our products we could experience lower trading volumes slower growth or declines in revenues 

in addition interest rates are a significant factor influencing mortgage loan production volumes rising interest rates are likely to reduce mortgage loan production volumes which could potentially impact our transactionbased revenues 

in the event that inflation increases significantly and persistently this would likely increase the cost of capital resulting in a slowdown of the growth of early stage companies causing companies to stay private longer credit health of market participants may also be impacted increasing the risk of default or companies inability to comply with listing standards an inflationary environment may also reduce consumer optimism resulting in lower demand for mortgage loans 

factors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility and thus trading and mortgage loan production volumes include 

• global economic political and market conditions and 

• concerns over inflation deflation legislative and regulatory changes government fiscal and monetary policy  including actions by the federal reserve and other foreign monetary units governing bodies and investor and consumer confidence levels 

factors that are particularly likely to affect trading volumes include 

• weather conditions including hurricanes and other significant events natural and unnatural disasters like large oil spills that impact the production of commodities and in the case of energy commodities production refining and distribution facilities for oil and natural gas 

• war acts of terrorism and any unforeseen market closures or disruptions in trading 

• political developments impacting international trade including trade disputes and increased tariffs particularly between the us and china and imposition of protectionist measures 

• real and perceived changes in the supply and demand of commodities underlying our products particularly energy and agricultural products including changes as a result of technological improvements or the development of alternative energy sources and 

• credit quality of market participants the availability of capital and the levels of assets under management 

any one or more of these factors which are beyond our control may reduce volumes and trading activity further lower market volatility could also result in more exchanges competing for trading volumes to maintain their growth if any of these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets could be jeopardized because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our current products and services declines for any reason we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues which would cause our net income to decline 

systems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry and mortgage technology industry could negatively impact us 

highprofile system failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry and mortgage technology industry have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our business and result in a loss of confidence in our technology and our markets regulatory investigations fines and penalties and business activity slowdown or interruptions further regulators have imposed requirements for trading platforms that have been costly for us to implement and could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services in particular the sec’s regulation systems compliance and integrity or regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations subject portions of our securities and derivatives trading platforms and other technological systems related to our clearing houses trade repositories and the us swap execution facility or sef to extensive regulation and oversight ensuring our compliance with the requirements of regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations requires significant ongoing administrative and compliance expenses and burdens in addition the sec’s expansion of the ice systems that are determined to be in scope for regulation sci could result in significant additional expenditures 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism including cyberterrorism than other companies 

given our prominence in the global securities industry and the location of many of our properties and personnel in us and european financial centers including lower manhattan and our presence in india abu dhabi and israel we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees in addition terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets including trading on exchanges any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results 

since we conduct operations in a number of countries and regions including the us uk eu canada asia pacific and the middle east substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies could affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

external events such as brexit have caused and may in the future cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially among the us dollar the british pound sterling and the euro if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the uk eu the us or other key markets deteriorate the value of the pound sterling euro or us dollar may weaken further financial instability in a particular country could have a contagion effect on the region in which it is located and contribute to general instability and uncertainty in that region events that adversely affect our 

clients and suppliers in a region could in turn have a materially adverse effect on our international business results and our operating results 

for additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk refer to “ foreign currency exchange rate risk” in item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk which is included in this annual report 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we have achieved significant growth since becoming a public company in 2005 our growth is highly dependent on customer demand for our core products and services favorable economic conditions and our ability to invest in our personnel facilities infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls adverse economic conditions could reduce customer demand for our products and services which may place a significant strain on our management and resources and could force us to defer existing or future planned opportunities we regularly evaluate our existing operations service capacity and business efficiencies and as a result of such evaluations we may undertake strategic initiatives outside of and within our businesses we may not be successful in executing on our strategies to support our growth organically or through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances 

we may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities 

we from time to time launch and intend in the future to launch new products services and business ventures and continue to explore and pursue other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we have spent and may continue to spend substantial time and money developing new product or service offerings or improving current product or service offerings if these offerings are not successful we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to recover the costs of such initiatives obtaining any required regulatory approval associated with these offerings may also result in delays or restrictions on our ability to benefit fully from these offerings further we have entered into and may seek in the future to enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry among other advantages 

in addition in light of consolidation in the exchange data services clearing and mortgage technology sectors and competition for opportunities we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully our competitors could merge making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors also offering new products and services and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives that are necessary for our success 

climate change and the transition to renewable energy and a net zero economy pose operational commercial and regulatory risks 

climate change may increase the frequency or severity of extreme weather events and if we are not adequately resilient to deal with acute climate events our operations either in a particular location or globally may be impacted extreme weather events could also impact the activities of our customers or thirdparty vendors or suppliers the physical commodities and assets underlying certain of our markets may also be impacted by climate change 

in addition the transition to renewable energy and a net zero economy involves changes to consumer and institutional preferences around energy consumption and the possible failure of our products or services to facilitate the needs of customers during the transition to renewable energy could adversely impact our business and revenues changing preferences could also have an adverse impact on the operations or financial condition of our customers which could result in reduced revenues from those customers we are also subject to risks relating to new or heightened climate changerelated regulations or legislation which could impact us and our customers and result in increased regulatory compliance or operational costs we are also subject to reputational risks relating to the perception of whether or not we are facilitating a migration away from fossil fuels for example our reputation could be damaged as a result of our offering certain products or services associated with causing or exacerbating climate change or by any decision by us to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change 

the risks associated with climate change and the transition to renewable energy and a net zero economy are continuing to evolve rapidly and we expect that climate changerelated risks may increase over time 

the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions globally and has led governmental authorities to take unprecedented measures to mitigate the spread of the disease including travel bans border closings business closures quarantines and shelterinplace orders and to take actions designed to stabilize markets and promote economic growth 

from an operational perspective the spread of covid19 has resulted in and could again result in temporary closures of our office facilities and the office facilities of our customers and our thirdparty vendors we have taken preventive measures and implemented contingency plans and currently many of our employees are working remotely however we cannot assure you that such measures will adequately protect our business and an extended period of remote work arrangements could heighten existing and introduce new operational risks including but not limited to cybersecurity risk and could strain our technological resources and business continuity plans if one or more of the thirdparty vendors to whom we outsource certain material activities claim that they cannot perform due to a force majeure or experience operational failures as a result of the covid19 pandemic it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition further although we maintain contingency plans for events such as pandemic outbreaks the further spread of covid19 could impact the availability of our executive officers and other key employees who are necessary to conduct our business the emergence of new covid19 variant strains that are resistant to vaccines or a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines over the long term could impact among other things the availability of our staff and primary facilities and the viability of our customers 

while governmental organizations continue to engage in efforts to combat the spread and severity of covid19 these measures may not be effective moreover actions taken by us or other governmental authorities that were intended to ameliorate the macroeconomic or other effects of covid19 or delays in the announcement or implementation of regulatory measures that had been pending prior to the covid19 pandemic resulted in and may in the future result in regulatory uncertainty and could in turn impact our business 

in addition the spread of covid19 variants along with other factors such as restrictions and limitations on business activities labor shortages at ports and for longhaul transportation rising fuel costs and raw material shortages have resulted in disruptions to global supply chains which has impacted the availability of critical hardware and extended lead times for certain components and systems we require for our operations the covid19 pandemic could continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain hardware and related products for technology that we need to operate our business effectively and efficiently our inability to acquire suitable hardware and related products on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect our business pandemicrelated restrictions could also impact thirdparty providers abilities to meet their contractual obligations to us potentially impacting our operations 

the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments including among other things the effectiveness of vaccines over the long term and against emerging variant strains a prolonged economic downturn could have an adverse effect on our revenues related to certain activities such as a decline in demand for certain data products and a decline in ipos the covid19 pandemic could also have an adverse impact on our customers’ businesses risk management needs and ability to trade in addition to the extent that covid19 may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations it may also heighten other risks described in this section 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill other intangible assets or investments 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2021 we had goodwill of 211 billion and net other intangible assets of 137 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties 

during 2021 we did not record any impairments of our goodwill intangible assets or investments we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may result in these types of impairments an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill other intangible assets and other investments and assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 

for additional information on our goodwill other intangible assets and investments refer to notes 3 4 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements and “ critical accounting policies  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets” in item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which are included in this annual report 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our majority investment in bakkt and the investment may introduce additional risks to our business due to its evolving business model 

we have a majority ownership interest in bakkt which operates as a separate publiclytraded company listed on the nyse due to our majority ownership interest in bakkt we have increased financial and reputational risks if there is a security or system failure a failure to launch one or more products or if bakkts business is unsuccessful it may take longer than expected for us to realize the expected returns from this investment or such returns may ultimately be less than anticipated furthermore our investment in bakkt entails numerous risks including risks relating to bakkt’s ability to 

• manage the complexity of its business model to stay current with the industry 

• successfully enter categories and markets in which it may have limited or no prior experience 

• apply distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets 

• successfully develop and integrate products systems or personnel into its business operations

• maintain technology systems and processes that prevent cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities 

as digital assets and blockchain technologies evolve bakkt may add modify or discontinue certain aspects of its business model relating to the product mix and service offerings future additions and modifications to bakkt’s business will increase the complexity of its business and place significant strain on bakkt’s management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we cannot offer any assurance that these or any other additions or modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to bakkt’s business 

legal and regulatory 

our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to extensive legislation and regulatory scrutiny and we face the risk of changes to our regulatory environment and business in the future 

we are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in many jurisdictions around the world and in particular in the us and the uk we face the risk of significant actions by regulatory and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments which may affect our business the activity of our market participants and our results among other things as a result of regulators and tax authorities enforcing existing laws and regulations we could be censured fined prohibited from pursuing certain acquisitions or engaging in some of our business activities subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities including fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory pricing restrictions also known as frand or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees including settlement payments interest payments and penalty payments in many cases our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions 

the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients’ overall trading volume through our exchanges and demand for our market data and connectivity offerings mortgage technology and other services 

we are also subject to regulatory risks relating to the mortgage industry which is heavily regulated in the us changes to existing laws or regulations or adoption of new laws or regulations that affect the residential mortgage industry could reduce residential mortgage volume or otherwise limit the ability of users and participants of our mortgage technology services to operate their businesses resulting in decreased usage of our solutions alternatively reduced regulatory requirements could also reduce the demand for certain of our products and services which are intended to enable our customers to satisfy existing regulatory requirements potential structural changes in the us residential mortgage industry in particular those involving the roles of fannie mae and freddie mac could disrupt the residential mortgage 

market and have a material adverse effect on our business further as a critical thirdparty service provider in the mortgage industry we are subject to supervision and examination by certain regulators which has resulted in and will continue to result in additional operating costs 

there is ongoing public concern regarding data privacy and data protection in many jurisdictions in which ice operates many of those jurisdictions have passed data privacy legislation with many more contemplating new laws the laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us regulation of privacy and data protection often times require monitoring of and changes to our data practices in regard to the collection use disclosure storage transfer andor security of personal and sensitive information including the personal information of the customers of the users of the software and services provided by our ice mortgage technology business 

these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our stockholders and creditors 

us uk and eu legal and regulatory developments in particular emir emir 22 uk mifid ii and eu mifid ii the uk bmr and the eu bmr including each such regulation as incorporated into uk law and the doddfrank act have significantly altered and propose to further alter the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability these regulatory developments could also cause us to change our business practices restructure our businesses or move certain of our businesses and employees the enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes most likely to affect our businesses are nondiscriminatory access provisions of uk mifid ii and eu mifid ii interoperability and margin rules in emir enhanced regulatory capital liquidity and leverage rules in basel iii and capital requirements directive iv access rules under the uk bmr and eu bmr the nonharmonization of margin requirements implementation of a financial transaction tax access to our benchmarks and maintaining our exchanges’ abilities to operate as sros with related immunity for the discharge of their regulatory functions as the operator of global businesses the lack of harmonization in international financial reform efforts could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in multiple jurisdictions 

the doddfrank act established enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the fsoc ice clear credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the fsoc and as a result is subject to additional oversight by the cftc compliance with these requirements has resulted in and will continue to result in additional operating costs 

in 2016 the sec approved a plan to establish a marketwide consolidated audit trail or cat to improve regulators’ ability to monitor trading activity in 2018 the first phase of implementation went live and required sro participants to begin reporting to the cat in addition to increased risk in connection with our regulatory obligations implementation of the cat could result in significant additional expenditures which may not be reimbursed funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the sros and brokerdealers to date however funding has been provided solely by the sros partly in exchange for promissory notes which increases the risk that sros including us will not be reimbursed for costs expended to date due to the replacement of the original plan processor we recorded promissory note impairment charges of 2 million and 16 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively because the sec has not approved a funding model that shares the cost of the cat between sros and brokerdealers we believe there is a risk that sros are not reimbursed resulting in this impairment until the sec approves a funding model the sros will continue to incur additional costs which may become significant and may not be reimbursed as of december 31 2021 we have accrued approximately 51 million as a receivable in connection with our portion of expenses related to the cat implementation 

there is an increased focus on and scrutiny of esg data and ratings providers by regulators and policymakers regulators and policymakers have indicated that extension of their regulatory oversight to esg data service providers is possible this could result in new or additional regulations applicable to our esg data products and services which could result in additional operating costs 

we are subject to tax laws regulations rulings and audits in multiple us and nonus jurisdictions that could have a significant impact on our business and lead to additional expenditures for us or our customers for example there have been discussions in various jurisdictions around financial transaction or digital service tax frameworks changes to tax frameworks in jurisdictions where we operate significant business for example in new jersey new york the eu or 

federally in the us have the potential to increase costs to us or to our market participants and discourage participation in the markets we operate furthermore implementation of any new or amended tax laws or regulations could impact our global operations trading volumes or financial results 

other enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations 

our compliance and risk management methods as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations might not be effective which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators 

our ability to comply with existing and future rules regulations and laws largely depends on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel regulators periodically review our ability to selfregulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including selfregulatory standards certain of our businesses associated with the nyse are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations policies and procedures if we fail to comply with any of these obligations regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business 

our acquisitions expose us to new regulatory requirements for example as a result of our acquisition of interactive data in 2015 we operate an investment adviser registered with the sec under the investment advisers act in addition our acquisition of the bondpoint ats in january 2018 and our acquisition of tmc bonds in july 2018 exposes us to increased exposure to regulatory scrutiny from the sec finra and msrb our acquisition of ellie mae in 2020 exposes us to increased exposure to regulatory scrutiny from us regulatory bodies which regulate the us residential mortgage industry including the ffiec and its member agencies including among others the cfpb compliance with any such regulatory requirements gives rise to costs and expenses that may be material 

our regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders embargo future business activity or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses we continue to face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity of our business any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our financial condition operating results or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined to be in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business further any settlement consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or regulatory agencies begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities finally the implementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to remain competitive and grow our business 

regulatory changes or court rulings may have an adverse impact on our ability to derive revenue from market data and connectivity fees 

regulatory developments or court rulings could reduce the amount of revenue that we obtain from exchange market data and connectivity fees related to our us equity and options exchanges with respect to our us equities and equity options exchanges our ability to assess fees for market data products and certain connectivity fees are subject to review by the sec there continue to be opposing industry viewpoints and litigation as to the extent that our us equities and equity options exchanges should be able to charge for market data and market access and the manner in which we set such exchange fees could be reassessed 

if new constraints are placed on our ability to charge for market data or market access in the us it could have a negative impact on our revenues we cannot predict whether or in what form any regulatory or other changes will take effect or their impact on our business a determination by the sec or a court for example that the sec must link market data fees to marginal costs take a more active role in the market data ratesetting process or reduce the current levels of market data fees could have an adverse effect on our market data revenues 

separately our european exchanges are currently authorized to sell trade information on a nondiscriminatory basis at a reasonable cost this regulatory position could be modified or interpreted by the european commission or ec or future european court decisions in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our european market data revenues 

in addition the fca and iosco have both issued consultations to explore access to market data in financial markets the results of these consultations may lead to a regulatory response that could affect our business similar to the us if new constraints are placed on our ability to charge for market data or market access in the uk or other jurisdictions it could have a negative impact on our revenues 

the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the uks exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

in 2016 voters in the uk approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit brexit has created political and economic uncertainty and instability in the global markets including currency and credit markets particularly in the uk and eu in addition political and economic uncertainty surrounding the future relationship of the uk and eu could lead to certain macroeconomic conditions that adversely affect our business the longterm effects of brexit will depend in part on the agreement the uk made to retain access to eu markets 

in december 2019 the uk withdrew from the eu on january 31 2020 and completed its withdrawal on january 1 2021 prior to completing its withdrawal in december 2020 the uk and eu agreed to a trade and cooperation agreement which was provisionally applied as of january 1 2021 this agreement governs the euuk relationship after the completion of the uk’s exit from the eu the ukeu brexit deal does not provide a transition period for financial services or any new arrangements to replace the existing “passport” this leaves both the uk and eu to address matters of access in financial services through declarations of equivalence under existing equivalence regimes contained in uk and eu law and through domestic laws the ec has however adopted an 18month temporary equivalence decision for uk ccps which began to apply as of january 1 2021 ice clear europe has been recognized by esma as a thirdcountry ccp in accordance with emir in november 2021 the ec announced that it will propose an extension of the equivalence decision applying to uk ccps in early 2022 

as a result of the uk and eu trade and cooperation agreement not providing free trade arrangements for financial services any equivalence determinations or any further transition period for financial services could include restrictions on access to our services by persons located in the eu or make access more expensive which could adversely affect our operations and profitability or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions the consequences of brexit and the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement could also cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding brexit including risks to our business associated with brexit 

risks relating to the administration of benchmarks and indices including libor and the potential for changes to cessations of and the replacement of or transition from benchmarks and indices including libor may result in legal risks and could adversely affect our business 

certain of our subsidiaries produce and license multiple benchmarks and indices across asset classes which are used globally and are referenced in certain of our trading and clearing products to ensure continued trading and clearing in these benchmarkrelated products and the continued licensing and use of these benchmarks and indices our subsidiaries must be able to demonstrate that these benchmarks and indices are determined with integrity and are not readily subject to manipulation and must also continue to evolve these benchmarks and indices as necessary to maintain their reliability and relevance and continue to administer these benchmarks and indices in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as an example our subsidiary iba is the administrator of various global benchmarks including libor any failures negative publicity or lawsuits related to our subsidiaries administration of benchmarks and indices including libor could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and indices and could harm our business and our reputation 

changes to cessations of and the replacement of or transition from our subsidiaries benchmarks and indices including libor or any other changes or reforms to the determination or administration of such benchmarks and indices could result in legal risks risks to our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results in july 2017 the fca stated its intention that it would no longer be necessary to sustain libor through its influence or legal powers beyond 2021 as a result regulators in multiple jurisdictions have encouraged market participants to transition from using libor to alternative reference rates the publication of most libor settings ceased after december 31 2021 and certain others are scheduled to cease after june 30 2023 

the fca is requiring iba to publish certain libor settings under a changed synthetic methodology during 2022 any settings published under a “synthetic” methodology will no longer be representative of the underlying market or economic reality the setting is intended to measure as those terms are used in the uk bmr any failures negative publicity or lawsuits related to our subsidiaries administration of synthetic libor could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and indices and could harm our business and our reputation 

under the uk bmr the use of continuing libor settings by uksupervised entities in certain regulated contracts and instruments may be restricted or prohibited the use of continuing libor settings in jurisdictions outside the uk and by entities subject to the oversight of other regulatory authorities may also be restricted or prohibited by law in those jurisdictions and by the requirements of such regulatory authorities we continue to monitor industry and regulatory developments in relation to the libor transition and cessation and the resulting impacts on our business and on the markets that use the benchmark today 

we may face liability for content contained in our data products and services 

we have been and may in the future be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation libel copyright or trademark infringement fraud or negligence or based on other theories of liability in each case relating to the data articles commentary ratings information or other content we distribute in our financial data services if such data or other content or information that we distribute has errors is delayed or has design defects we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our corporate website or those websites that we own and operate through links to other websites use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for significant amounts any such claim even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us could involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and a negative impact on our reputation 

in addition we license and redistribute data and content from various thirdparty sources and the terms of these licenses change frequently our thirdparty data and content suppliers may audit our use of and our clients’ use of and payment for data and content from time to time in the ordinary course of business including audits currently underway such thirdparty data and content suppliers have asserted and may in the future assert that we or our clients owe additional amounts under the terms of the applicable license agreements that we inappropriately distributed the thirdparty data or that we or our clients used the data or content in a manner that exceeded the scope of the applicable license agreement or without a license agreement in some instances where we have certain commercial relationships with thirdparties we have assumed the responsibility for this thirdparty source liability we have and expect to continue to spend and allocate resources to develop and acquire the use of technology and other intellectual property rights to manage these risks and track thirdparty data usage but we cannot be assured that we will not incur liability the costs and resources required to investigate any allegations could be material and we may still be required to pay damages to or make unexpected large settlement payments to these data and content suppliers which could also give rise to reputational harm 

we are subject to significant litigation and liability risks 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our participants involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred for example dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platforms or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades abusive trading practices security and confidentiality breaches mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants in addition because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by entering them inaccurately a large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets 

in addition we are subject to ongoing legal disputes that could result in the payment of fines penalties or damages and could expose us to additional liability in the future see item 3 legal proceedings in this annual report for a general description of our legal proceedings and claims and note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for a summary of specific legal proceedings the outcome of any of these legal proceedings that remain unresolved cannot be determined and adverse rulings in these matters could impact our financial condition and continued operations 

further we could incur significant expenses defending the claims mentioned above and any future claims even those without merit which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us including those we are involved with due to acquisition activity may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we may have to establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change 

operational and liquidity 

our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cyberattacks hacking and other cybersecurity risks which could result in wrongful manipulation disclosure destruction or use of our information or that of a third party or which could make our participants unable or reluctant to use our electronic platforms 

the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to reliably transact on our electronic platforms and provide financial data services are critical elements of our operations some of our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential client and other data including client portfolio information or personally identifiable information if anyone gains improper access to our electronic platforms networks or databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify our confidential information or that of a third party breaches of our cybersecurity measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business our networks and those of our participants thirdparty service providers and external market infrastructures may be vulnerable to compromise unauthorized access security technology failure computer viruses social engineering denial of service attacks terrorism ransomware attacks firewall or encryption failures or other security problems resulting in loss of data integrity information disclosure unavailability or fraud the financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of political protest activism and financial gain and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for cyberattack and other information security threats further former employees of companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly 

although we have not been subject to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity events including distributed denial of service or ddos attacks malware infections phishing web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size for example we experienced ddos attempts brand misuse and phishing attempts directed toward employee systems and personal email accounts during 2021 while we operate an information security program that is designed to prevent detect track and mitigate cyber incidents and that has detected and mitigated such incidents in the past we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against future attacks any such attacks could result in reputational damage cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose customers cause us to experience lower current and future trading volumes or incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive position in addition given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or disable or degrade systems a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected and we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely the extent of a particular cyber incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while such an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it which may compound damages before the incident is discovered or remediated additionally as threats continue to evolve and increase and as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities which could adversely impact our net income 

further cybersecurity threats to and incidents involving vendors and other third parties who support our activities  particularly those with lesssophisticated defenses  could impact us for example although we did not experience any material impacts from the log4j security vulnerability that was widely publicized in december 2021 we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may be material 

our business may be harmed by computer and communication systems failures and delays 

our business depends on the integrity reliability and security of our infrastructure which is highly dependent on our computer and communication systems our customers rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate and highquality financial market data analytics and related solutions our timely reliable delivery of highquality products and services is dependent upon an array of technical production processes that enable our content delivery platforms our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans including our ability to recover from the loss of one of our primary data centers may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach our systems or those of our thirdparty providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

• unanticipated disruption in service to our participants 

• slower response time and delays in our participants’ trade execution and processing 

• failed settlement by participants to whom we provide trade confirmation or clearing services 

• incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades 

• failure to complete the clearing house margin settlement process resulting in significant financial risk 

• distribution of inaccurate or untimely market data to participants who rely on this data in their trading activity 

• disruption to ice mortgage technology and loan origination systems and 

• financial loss to us or those who depend on our systems and data 

we have experienced system failures in the past due to telecommunication failures and hardware and software malfunctions and defects and could experience future system failures due to power or telecommunications failures human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyberattacks intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar events these situations could result in damage to our business reputation and participant dissatisfaction with our electronic platform which could prompt participants to trade elsewhere or expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions as a consequence our business financial condition and operating results could suffer materially 

our regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses could be adversely affected 

an interruption or cessation of an important service data or content supplied by any third party or the loss of an exclusive license could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as online service providers hosting service and software providers data processors data centers software and hardware vendors banks local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading clearing data services mortgage technology applications and other systems we rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with third parties and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for the provision of hosting services we also depend on thirdparty suppliers for data and content including data received from certain competitors clients various government and public record services and financial institutions used in our products and services some of this data is exclusive to particular suppliers and may not be obtained from other suppliers in addition our data suppliers could enter into exclusive contracts with our competitors without our knowledge the general trend toward industry consolidation may increase the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future if these companies were to experience difficulties discontinue providing services to us for any reason or be unable to or fail to provide the type of service agreed to for any reason we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines or damage to our reputation it could require a significant amount of time and additional resources to transition to new thirdparty service providers or to enter into new commercial arrangements in order to offset loss of services to our clients our thirdparty data suppliers perform audits on us from time to time in the ordinary course of business to determine if data we license for redistribution has been properly accounted for in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreement as a result of these audits we may incur additional expenses 

many of our clients also rely on third parties to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform if these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients’ inability to transact with our businesses we hold exclusive licenses to list various index futures and contracts in the future litigation or regulatory action may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and contracts trading to a single exchange and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license mifid ii introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of services relating to commodity derivatives across europe and the legislation requires open access to any benchmarks used in europe if unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive license were permitted we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products 

our success largely depends on key personnel including our senior management and having adequate succession plans in place we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business which could harm our business 

our future performance depends in large part on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel including our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel competition for key personnel in the various localities and business segments in which we operate is intense our ability to attract and retain key personnel in particular senior management will be dependent on a number of factors including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent current economic market social and political conditions and the recent reopening of the global economy have increased talent risk which has led to higher employee attrition and made recruitment for certain positions more difficult and could lead to a loss of top performers and make it more difficult to fill key positions for example our inoffice requirements as well as the location of our offices and our remote working arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees including senior management or other key employees or may not be viewed as competitive which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees in addition we operate globally and geopolitical events or conflicts in the countries or regions in which we operate could lead to physical risks to our personnel and disruption to business continuity that could negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy there is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who we rely upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives the loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel could harm our business in particular we have to incur costs to replace senior officers or other key employees who leave and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner or at all 

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and restrict our activities or satisfy our debt service obligations 

as of december 31 2021 we had 139 billion of outstanding debt this level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt service obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our peers and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities as we use our available resources to reduce and refinance our consolidated debt our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue future business opportunities may be further restrained in addition the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio test and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other matters further a portion of our outstanding debt has historically been and continues to be in commercial paper which is subject to interest rate changes rising interest rates will result in an increase in our interest expense we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could materially affect our financial condition 

our longterm and shortterm debt is currently rated by moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s these ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time and it is possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade our credit ratings in the future in particular our inability to sustain reduced debt on a consolidated basis may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings 

a significant downgrade of our credit ratings in the future could impact customers’ willingness to use our clearing houses make parties less willing to do business with us and could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase the cost of our commercial paper and any future debt funding we may obtain 

competition 

we face intense competition failure to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences could negatively impact our competitive position 

we face intense competition in all aspects of our business and our competitors both domestic and international are numerous we currently compete with 

• regulated diversified futures exchanges that offer trading in a variety of asset classes similar to those offered by us such as energy agriculture equity and equity index credit and interest rate derivatives markets and foreign exchange 

• exchanges offering listing and trading of cash equities etfs closedend funds and other structured products similar to those offered by us 

• market data and information vendors 

• providers of digital solutions including providers of mortgage origination compliance pricing and documentation services 

• interdealer brokers active in the global credit derivatives markets 

• existing and newly formed electronic trading platforms service providers and exchanges some of which do not receive the same regulatory scrutiny as established market places 

• other clearing houses and 

• consortiums of our customers members or market participants that may work together to achieve more favorable terms or pool their trading activity to establish new exchanges trading platforms or clearing facilities 

trends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings finally many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and ats businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business some of our competitors may have greater capital and resources offer a wide range of products and services or operate under less stringent regulatory regimes than we do 

in the mortgage technology sector we compete against other software providers as well as companies that offer “point of sale” or webbased online loan applications services we also compete with traditional methods of exchanging data and documents among mortgage industry participants such as email facsimile phone courier and mail mortgage originators may also manually upload loan data or enter information into each investor’s lender’s or service provider’s website in lieu of using our solutions there is vigorous competition among providers of mortgage technology services and we may be unsuccessful in differentiating our services to the extent necessary to effectively compete and may not succeed in convincing potential customers using other services or methods to switch to ours 

we also face pricing competition in many areas of our business a decline in our fees due to competitive pressure or regulatory changes the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for example our data service offerings have benefited from a high renewal rate in its subscriptionbased services but we cannot assure you that this will continue we also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings modify the pricing for our products or retain our current customers or attract new customers if we are not able to compete successfully our business could be materially impacted including our ability to remain as an operating entity 

our success depends on our ability to maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our technology to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary and acquired technology the financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change change in use patterns change in client preferences frequent product and service introductions the emergence of new industry standards and practices and increased consolidation through 

mergers and acquisitions activity that results in new competitors or expanded product offerings by current competitors these changes could render our existing proprietary technology uncompetitive or obsolete 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology to our clients’ requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and costeffective manner any failure to remain abreast of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to client preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our results 

damage to our reputation could damage our business 

our business is highly competitive and our customers typically have options on where to conduct their business our management team and business operations benefit from being highly regarded in our industry maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and for maintaining our relationships with our regulators negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services operations risk management compliance with regulations political affiliations or management team could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our existing business and business prospects 

intellectual property 

our use of open source software could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services and subject us to litigation 

we use some opensource software in our technology most often as small components within a larger product or service to augment algorithms functionalities or libraries we create and we may use more opensource software in the future opensource code is also contained in some thirdparty software we rely on we could be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of the license for such opensource software the terms of many opensource licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us or other courts and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services further opensource licensors generally do not provide technology support maintenance warranties or assurance of title or controls on the origin of the software which can also lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties including trademarks service marks trade names trade secrets copyrights and patents we cannot assure you that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property additionally we may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively further we have resorted to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in the past and may need to in the future which requires significant financial and managerial resources as a result we have chosen not to enforce our infringed intellectual property rights in the past and may choose not to in the future depending on our strategic evaluation and judgment regarding the best use of our resources the relative strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the recourse available to us 

in addition our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained and may obtain in the future patent and intellectual property rights related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents and intellectual property rights that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services as a result we have in the past faced and may in the future face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents and intellectual property rights held by others we may be subject to lawsuits or required to stop developing or marketing the products or services obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the owners of the intellectual property or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the thirdparty intellectual property we also have in the past and could in the future be required to pay damages if we are found to infringe intellectual property rights held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to intellectual property rights held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

common stock 

we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders principal and interest on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock is dividends from our subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may fail to complete or realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our acquisitions or anticipated growth opportunities or expected benefits of our strategic investments which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we have completed many acquisitions and plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to integrate these businesses and realize anticipated cost savings revenue synergies and growth opportunities we generally set aggressive timelines for realizing savings which assumes we successfully undertake a variety of actions including but not limited to integrating technology eliminating redundancies and effecting organizational restructurings that are themselves subject to a variety of risks and may be subject to regulatory approvals that we do not control the process of integrating acquired companies is time consuming and could disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties including inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants regulators and others require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of the business 

there is also a risk that we may not integrate these acquired companies in a manner that permits our expected cost savings and revenue synergies to be fully realized in the time periods expected or at all in addition a variety of factors including but not limited to regulatory conditions governmental competition approvals cultural differences and difficulty integrating technology platforms may adversely affect our ability to complete our acquisitions or realize our anticipated cost savings and synergies 

we may also not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures or alliances that we have entered into or may enter into for a number of reasons including decline in value of the other company regulatory or government approvals or changes global market changes contractual obligations competing products and in some instances our lack of or limited control over the management of the business for example we have a majority ownership interest in bakkt but do not control the management of the business a substantial decline in bakkts financial performance or stock price significant failure to or any major technology failures or cyber attacks could lead to litigation against us and reputational harm that could negatively impact our business and the value of our stock further strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future 

as a result of any future acquisition we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest expend cash incur debt assume actual and contingent liabilities inherit existing or pending litigation or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets further we cannot assure you that any such financing or equity investments will be available with terms that will be favorable to us or available at all 

provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ice 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for ice these provisions make a change of control less likely which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of us and european equity exchanges for example our organizational documents include provisions that generally restrict any person either alone or together with its related persons from i voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10 of our outstanding voting capital stock including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock or ii beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock further our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to call special stockholders’ meetings or act by written consent and generally authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock in addition provisions of delaware law may have a similar 

effect such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders as defined under delaware law from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the board of directors

on october 15 2021 bakkt holdings llc or bakkt completed its merger with vpc impact acquisition holdings or vih a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by victory park capital or vpc bakkt is an integrated platform that enables customers and consumers to transact in digital assets 

the business combination between bakkt and vih resulted in enterprise value of approximately 21 billion including approximately 479 million of cash on the combined company’s balance sheet reflecting a contribution of up to 123 million of cash held in vih’s trust account and a 325 million concurrent private investment in public equity or pipe of class a common stock of the combined company and 31 million of cash held in bakkt accounts the pipe was priced at 1000 per share and included a 47 million commitment from us the newly combined company has been renamed bakkt holdings inc and is listed on the new york stock exchange or nyse 

as part of the transaction bakkt’s existing equity holders and management rolled 100 of their equity into the combined company and are subject to a sixmonth lockup period certain shareholders of vih exercised their redemption rights and at closing bakkt equity holders including ice owned approximately 81 of the combined company vih’s public shareholders owned approximately 5 vpc owned 2 and pipe investors a group that also includes us owned approximately 12 of the issued and outstanding common stock of the combined company

covid19 

since march 2020 the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions globally and has led governmental authorities to take unprecedented measures to mitigate the spread of the disease including travel bans border closings business closures quarantines and shelterinplace orders and to take actions designed to stabilize markets and promote economic growth 

from an operational perspective our businesses including our exchanges clearing houses listing venues data services businesses and mortgage platforms have remained open and we do not have any plans to close any of our business operations as a result of the covid19 pandemic however due to the covid19 pandemic we have taken preventative measures and implemented contingency plans and many of our employees are continuing to work remotely we believe that our global office closures and phased reopening measures were and continue to be in compliance as necessary with local government directives and social distancing directives we continue to monitor local government mandates in determining our office reopenings reclosures and workrelated travel 

global health concerns relating to covid19 and preventive measures taken to reduce its spread have created significant volatility in financial markets which has resulted in higher trading volumes for some of our products and increased demand for our services 

the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on future developments including the duration spread and severity of the outbreak the effectiveness of vaccines against covid19 over the long term and against new and emerging variants thereof and the actions taken to contain the spread of the disease or mitigate its impact we continue to monitor this dynamic situation including guidance and regulations issued by us and other governmental authorities in light of the continually evolving nature of the covid19 outbreak we are not able at this time to estimate the ultimate effect of the pandemic on our business results of operations or financial condition in the future

business environment and market trends 

our business environment has been characterized by 

• globalization of marketplaces customers and competitors 

• growing customer demand for workflow efficiency and automation 

• commodity interest rate and financial markets uncertainty 

• growing demand for data to inform customers risk management and investment decisions 

• evolving increasing and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions 

• price volatility increasing customers demand for risk management services 

• increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies 

• customers preference to manage risk in markets demonstrating the greatest depth of liquidity and product diversity 

• the evolution of existing products and new product innovation to serve emerging customer needs and changing industry agreements 

• rising demand for speed data data capacity and connectivity by market participants necessitating increased investment in technology and 

• consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading clearing and listings 

recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets centralized clearing and access to data all of which are important aspects of our product offering however some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered in addition some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several nonus regulations are inconsistent with us rules as the evolution continues legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data as a result it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will 

have on us as discussed more fully in item 1 “ business  regulation” included in this annual report brexit the implementation of mifid ii and other regulations may result in operational regulatory andor business risk 

we have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or transaction activity in any one asset class in addition we have increased our portion of recurring revenues from 34 in 2014 to 49 in 2021 these recurring revenues include data services listings and various mortgage technology solutions 

many of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels we anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends including the following 

• increasing global regulatory demands 

• greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations 

• greater emphasis on risk management 

• market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes 

• the move to passive investing and indexation 

• ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets 

• increased automation of fixed income mortgage and other less automated markets 

• the development of new data products 

• the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity 

• new entrants and 

• increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions 

we continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams and prudently manage expenses in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data clearing markets and technology solutions 

segment results 

our business is conducted through three reportable business segments comprised of the following 

• our exchanges segment includes our trade execution and clearing within our global futures network and nyse businesses various data and connectivity services that are directly related to those exchange platforms administration fees and our nyse listings business trade execution and clearing products include energy agricultural and metals financial futures and options cash equities equity options otc and other 

• our fixed income and data services segment includes pricing and reference data analytics indices trade execution and clearing within our ice bonds and cds businesses consolidated feeds and our ice global network businesses and 

• our mortgage technology segment includes origination technology closing solutions data and analytics and other mortgage technology businesses 

while revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than one segment we directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so otherwise we use a prorata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all segments our segments do not engage in intersegment transactions 

beginning in the first quarter of 2021 origination technology revenues include those related to our ice mortgage technology network previously reported in closing solutions revenues and closing solutions revenues now include registration revenues related to merscorp holdings inc or mers previously reported in other revenues we believe these changes more accurately reflect how we operate the business prioryear periods have been adjusted to reflect these changes

our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue these section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government’s costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals and are subject to change we in turn collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced the activity assessment fees are designed to equal the section 31 fees as a result activity assessment fees and the corresponding section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income although the timing of 

payment by us will vary from collections section 31 fees were 248 million and 622 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively the decrease in section 31 fees was primarily related to a decline in rates which were revised in february of both years the fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the sec semiannually as required the total amount is included in accrued liabilities and was 57 million as of december 31 2021

the majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues except for certain technology and communication expenses including data acquisition costs licensing and other feerelated arrangements and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance 

we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with the growth of our business and to vary from yeartoyear based on the type and level of our acquisitions our integrations and other investments 

in 2021 and 2020 10 and 11 respectively of our operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros due to fluctuations in the us dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro our consolidated operating expenses were 22 million higher in 2021 than in 2020 see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk” below for additional information

in connection with our equity investment in euroclear we recognized dividend income of 60 million in 2021 and 19 million in 2019 included in other income as a result of a 2020 european regulation limiting dividend payments we did not receive a euroclear dividend in 2020 but we received two dividend payments during 2021 in addition in both september 2021 and in november 2020 we became aware of observable price changes in orderly transactions of similar euroclear investments by third parties the transactions resulted in fair value adjustments of our euroclear investment and we recorded gains of 34 million and 35 million in other income in 2021 and 2020 respectively including the impacts of foreign currency exchange

consolidated income tax provision 

consolidated income tax expense was 16 billion and 658 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively the change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pretax income and the changes in our effective tax rate the consolidated income tax expense for 2021 was elevated due to the tax expense associated with the gains resulting from our coinbase and bakkt transactions 

our effective tax rate was 29 and 24 in 2021 and 2020 respectively the effective tax rate for 2021 is higher than the effective tax rate for 2020 primarily due to the deferred income tax impacts from the uk tax law changes as well as the bakkt transaction in june 2021 the uk enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 19 to 25 effective april 1 2023 

on march 27 2020 the cares act was enacted and certain income tax related relief was provided under the cares act on march 11 2021 the american rescue plan act or arpa was signed into law the arpa enacted certain provisions that are relevant to corporate income tax on november 15 2021 the infrastructure investment and jobs act was signed into law these provisions did not have a material impact on our income tax provision for 2021 or 2020

net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain items including depreciation and amortization deferred taxes stock based compensation and the effects of changes in working capital 

the 242 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 from 2020 was driven by an increase of accounts receivable collections of 144 million primarily due to a prior period covid19related decision to allow customers to defer payment of their 2020 listings invoices in addition operating cash increased due to a 20 billion increase in net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization deferred taxes the gain from the sale of our coinbase investment net of taxes of 892 million and the gain from the deconsolidation of bakkt of 14 billion these increases were partially offset by a decrease in section 31 fee collections of 219 million primarily due to lower rates which were revised in february of each year the remaining change is due to fluctuations in our working capital and the timing of various payments such as transactionrelated expenses and taxes payable on the sale of our coinbase investment

in september 2021 we used the proceeds from commercial paper issuances and cash on hand to fund the redemption of 125 billion aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due in june 2023 or the floating rate notes we delivered a notice of redemption of the floating rate notes to wells fargo bank national association as trustee under the indenture governing the floating rate notes which was delivered to the holders of the floating rate notes on september 17 2021 and they were subsequently redeemed on september 27 2021 in connection with this redemption we recorded 4 million in accelerated unamortized deferred loan costs which are included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of income for 2021 

we have a 38 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility or the credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement with wells fargo bank na as primary administrative agent issuing lender and swingline lender bank of america na as syndication agent backup administrative agent and swingline lender and the lenders party thereto as of december 31 2021 of the 38 billion that is currently available for borrowing under the credit facility 10 billion is required to backstop the amount outstanding under our commercial paper program and 171 million is required to support certain brokerdealer and other subsidiary commitments the amount required to backstop the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings the remaining 26 billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes including but not limited to acting as a backstop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program on october 15 2021 we agreed with the lenders to extend the maturity date of the credit facility to october 15 2026 among other items 

on august 21 2020 we entered into a 750 million 18month senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility with a maturity date of february 21 2022 we borrowed in full under the facility on september 3 2020 and the proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the ellie mae acquisition we had the option to prepay the facility in whole or in part at any time and paid off the full balance of the loan on december 16 2020 interest on borrowings under this term loan facility were based on the principal amount outstanding at libor plus an applicable margin which was equal to 1125

upon maturity of our commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper to mitigate this risk we maintain the credit facility for an aggregate amount which meets or exceeds the amount issued under our commercial paper program at any time if we were not able to issue new commercial paper we have the option of drawing on the backstop revolving facility however electing to do so would result in higher interest expense

capital return 

in december 2019 our board approved an aggregate of 24 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective january 1 2020 

during 2021 we repurchased 18 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of 250 million on the open market during 2020 we repurchased 136 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of 12 billion including 104 million shares at a cost of 948 million under our rule 10b51 trading plan and 32 million shares at a cost of 299 million on the open market shares repurchased are held in treasury stock 

we discontinued stock repurchases and terminated our rule 10b51 trading plan in august 2020 in connection with our ellie mae acquisition and in november 2021 we resumed repurchases the remaining balance of board approved funds for future repurchases as of december 31 2021 was 903 million in december 2021 our board approved an aggregate of 315 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective january 1 2022 the 315 billion replaces the previous amount approved by the board in december 2021 we entered into a new rule 10b51 trading plan that will become effective in february 2022 we may discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate a rule 10b51 trading plan at any time the approval of our board for the stock repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock in addition our board may increase or decrease the amount available for repurchases from time to time 

from time to time we enter into rule 10b51 trading plans as authorized by our board to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock we expect funding for any stock repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our commercial paper program or our debt facilities the timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a rule 10b51 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions in making a determination regarding any stock repurchases management considers multiple factors including overall stock market conditions our common stock price performance the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings our expected free cash 

flow and working capital needs our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources 

during 2021 we paid cash dividends of 132 per share of our common stock in the aggregate including quarterly dividends of 033 per share for an aggregate payout of 747 million which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years 

future capital requirements 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate of growth across our segments strategic plans and acquisitions available sources for financing activities required and discretionary technology and clearing initiatives regulatory requirements the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products the geographic mix of our business and potential stock repurchases 

we currently expect to incur capital expenditures including operational and real estate capital expenditures and to incur software development costs that are eligible for capitalization ranging in the aggregate between 490 million and 520 million in 2022 which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology business integration and the continued growth of our businesses 

as of december 31 2021 we had 903 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional details on our stock repurchase program 

our board has adopted a quarterly dividend policy providing that dividends will be approved quarterly by the board or the audit committee taking into account factors such as our evolving business model prevailing business conditions our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives and our financial results and capital requirements without a predetermined net income payout ratio for the first quarter of 2022 we announced a 038 per share dividend payable on march 31 2022 to stockholders of record as of march 17 2022 

other than the facilities for the ice clearing houses our credit facility and our commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have for liquidity and capital resources with third parties see notes 10 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion in the event of any strategic acquisitions mergers or investments or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders we may incur additional debt issue additional equity to raise necessary funds repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend however we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us see “risk factors and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

nongaap measures 

we use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent gaap measures or that supplement the information provided by our gaap measures we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance 

we use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance including in this annual report and believe that these measures when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than gaap measures alone in addition we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making periodtoperiod comparisons of results because the adjustments to gaap are not reflective of our core business performance 

these financial measures are not presented in accordance with or as an alternative to gaap financial measures and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies we encourage investors to review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report including our consolidated financial statements to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons 

the table below outlines our adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income attributable to ice common stockholders and adjusted earnings per share which are nongaap measures that are calculated by making adjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core 

business performance these measures including the adjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments in millions except for percentages and per share amounts are as follows 



amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles are included in nongaap adjustments as excluding these noncash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results 

transaction and integration costs are included as part of our core business expenses except for those that are directly related to the announcement closing financing or termination of a transaction however we adjust for the acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs relating to acquisitions such as ellie mae given the magnitude of the 114 billion 

purchase price of the acquisition we also adjust for the acquisitionrelated transaction costs related to the merger of bakkt and vih due to the significance of the transaction in 2020 we also included a 10 million adjustment for bridge2 solutions acquisition costs resulting from a bakkt incentive award market condition estimation adjustment as an acquisitionrelated success fee this adjustment was directly related to the march 2020 capital call to fund the acquisition of bridge2 solutions and we believe is therefore appropriate since we exclude costs directly related to the success of a transaction 

in 2021 we recorded a 12 billion gain on the sale of our coinbase equity investment and a 14 billion gain on the deconsolidation of bakkt we do not consider these items to be part of our core business operations 

effective january 1 2021 we exclude net income from our unconsolidated equity method investees for purposes of calculating nongaap measures and have retroactively restated the prioryear periods for comparability purposes for 2021 this adjustment includes our share of net income from occ bondlink and bakkt from the period of the bakkt merger on october 15 2021 through december 31 2021 this is consistent with how we treat changes in the fair value of our equity investments we believe these adjustments provide greater clarity of our performance given that equity investments are noncash and not a part of our core operations 

in addition we also include the following items as nongaap adjustments as each of these are not considered a part of our core business operations 

• 2021 the 34 million gain on the fair value adjustment of our euroclear equity investment 

• 2021 the 7 million gain related to the settlement of an acquisitionrelated indemnification claim 

• 2021 accrual of 16 million relating to a legal settlement 

• 2021 the acceleration of unamortized costs of 4 million related to the september 2021 early redemption of our floating rate notes 

• 2020 the 11 million impairment of software developed at bakkt when it was our subsidiary since it relates to the buildout of a fundamental software design vs a recurring upgrade 

• 2020 accrual of 30 million relating to a legal settlement 

• 2020 accrual of 8 million relating to a regulatory settlement 

• 2020 the 35 million gain on the fair value adjustment of our euroclear equity investment 

• 2020 the extinguishment payment of 14 million related to the june 2020 early redemption of the december 2020 senior notes which had an original maturity of december 1 2020 as a result of our new senior notes offering in may 2020 this included both a makewhole redemption payment and duplicative interest 

• 2020 the 20 million gain on the sale of our bids equity investment 

• 2020 preacquisition interest expense of 5 million on the august 2020 debt issued to fund a portion of the purchase price of our ellie mae acquisition 

• 2020 promissory note impairment charges of 2 million on work performed by the original plan processor on the cat as nongaap adjustments this was in addition to the 2019 accrual of 16 million for the same item see additional discussion on the cat in item 1a risk factors in this annual report 

• 2019 impairment of exchange registration intangible assets of 31 million at ice futures singapore this noncash impairment was a result of the estimated fair value of an acquired intangible asset falling below its carrying value see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

the tax items in nongaap adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pretax nongaap adjustments or tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance the following taxrelated items are included as nongaap adjustments 

• deferred tax adjustments on acquisitionrelated intangibles including the impact of uk and us state tax law changes and apportionment updates as well as other foreign tax law changes which resulted in deferred tax expensebenefit of 183 million 36 million and 8 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the deferred tax adjustments in 2021 relate primarily to the uk tax law changes enacted in june 2021 which increased the uk corporate income tax rate from 19 to 25 effective april 1 2023 the deferred tax adjustments in 2020 were due to the tax law changes enacted in july 2020 which increased the uk corporate income tax rate from 17 to 19 effective april 1 2020 as well as impacts of us state apportionment charges 

• other tax adjustments of 3 million in 2019 for audit settlement payments primarily related to preacquisition tax matters in connection with our acquisition of nyse in 2013

as of december 31 2021 we had 139 billion in outstanding debt including 15 billion of shortterm debt our outstanding debt consists of 129 billion of fixed rate senior notes 10 billion under our us dollar commercial paper program or the commercial paper program and 10 million under credit lines at our ice india subsidiaries

we also have unrecognized tax benefits or utbs as of december 31 2021 our cumulative utbs were 229 million and accrued interest and penalties related to utbs were 49 million we are under examination by various tax authorities we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax interest and penalties if any that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our utbs 

as of december 31 2021 we through nyse have net obligations of 103 million related to our pension and other benefit programs the date of payment under these net obligations cannot be determined see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs

new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us 

critical accounting policies 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and reevaluate them on a periodic basis based on these factors we make estimates and judgments about among other things the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies among others affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results assets and liabilities 

goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 

assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets including identified intangible assets we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles such as customer relationships trademarks technology trading products data exchange registrations backlog trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift our judgments and estimates may change which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not 

in performing the allocation of the acquisitions purchase price to assets and liabilities we consider among other factors the intended use of the acquired assets analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business at the acquisition date a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist we continue to review and assess our estimates assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by gaap which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition accordingly these estimates and assumptions are subject to change which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements estimation uncertainty may exist due to the sensitivity of the respective fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of an acquired business in our discounted cash flow models significant assumptions typically include revenue growth rates and expense synergies that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate 

our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and we have identified four reporting units which were updated in 2020 to reflect our new segment presentation our reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are the nyse other exchanges fixed income and data services and mortgage technology reporting units these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinitelived intangibles to its estimated fair value 

in accordance with accounting standards update 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  or asu2017 for both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible impairment testing we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if the fair value of the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the difference alternatively we may choose to bypass the qualitative option and perform quantitative testing to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value for our goodwill impairment testing we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and apply the quantitative approach for our testing of indefinitelived intangible assets we apply qualitative and quantitative approaches 

application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows longterm growth rates of our business operating margins discount rates weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets these estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment and changes to these estimates and assumptions as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor impairment during 2019 we recorded an impairment charge of 31 million on the remaining value of exchange registration intangible assets on ice futures singapore as a result of a decrease in fair value determined during our annual impairment testing we did not record any impairments in 2021 or 2020 as a result of our goodwill or indefinitelived impairment testing 

we are also required to evaluate other finitelived intangible assets for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable if impairment indicators are present then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these longlived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable if an asset is not recoverable the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us uk and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse 

the fasb staff has provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of global intangible lowtaxed income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred we have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred 

we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position if the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 

we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter at any point in time many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities changes in facts and circumstances issuance of new regulations and resolution of tax audits 

we believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 




 

item 7 a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a result of our operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure manage monitor and report risk exposures which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2021 and 2020 our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents were 20 billion for both periods of which 276 million and 245 million respectively were denominated in pounds sterling euros or canadian dollars and the remaining amounts are denominated in us dollars we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes a hypothetical 50 decrease in shortterm interest rates would have an immaterial impact on our annual pretax earnings as of december 31 2021 assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2021 we had 139 billion in outstanding debt of which 129 billion relates to our fixed rate senior notes the remaining amount outstanding of 10 billion relates to 10 billion outstanding under our commercial paper program which bears interest at fluctuating rates and 10 million under lines of credit at our india subsidiaries a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates relating to the amounts under our commercial paper program as of december 31 2021 would decrease annual pretax earnings by 10 million assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – debt and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper program decreased from 040 as of december 31 2020 to 033 as of december 31 2021 the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in shortterm interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as an international business we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling canadian dollars or euros and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros certain assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2021 and 2020 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table dollars in millions except exchange rates 





1 represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year 

we have a significant part of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros in both 2021 and 2020 13 of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros and in 2021 and 2020 10 and 11 respectively of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes the us equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly 

foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables occurs through our operations which are received in or paid in pounds sterling canadian dollars or euros due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of 13 million and 5 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively inclusive of the impact of foreign currency hedging transactions the foreign currency transaction losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar a 10 adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2021 assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity would result in a foreign currency loss of 15 million 

we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2021 and 2020 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities 

we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using a current rate of exchange with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account a component of equity our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below in millions 



foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss within our balance sheet see the table below for the portion of equity attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments as well as the activity by year included within our statement of other comprehensive income the impact of 

the foreign currency exchange rate differences in the table below were primarily driven by fluctuations of the pound sterling as compared to the us dollar which were 13524 13665 and 13260 as of december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 



the future impact on our business relating to the uk leaving the eu and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time including future impacts on currency exchange rates 

credit risk 

we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests 

clearing house cash deposit risks 

the ice clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member margin deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit market and liquidity risks refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ice clearing houses cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds invested deposits delivery contracts receivable and unsettled variation margin which were 1504 billion as of december 31 2021 while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits as the ice clearing houses may pass on interest revenues minus costs to the clearing members this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated 

• credit risk when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures credit risk is managed by using exposure limits depending on the credit profile of the counterparty as well as the nature and maturity of transactions our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk we seek to substantially mitigate the credit risk associated with investments by placing them with governments wellcapitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties 

an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties our policies require diversification of counterparties banks financial institutions bond issuers and funds so as to avoid a concentration of risk 

• liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency in the right place and at the right time to mitigate this risk the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets for example holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks 

• interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise and cause the value of securities we hold or invest in to decline if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity and interest rates had risen the sale might be made at a loss relative to the carrying value our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term 

investments for example where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities in addition the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt for example us treasury securities and supranational debt instruments euro cash deposits only with short dated maturities 

• security issuer risk security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on the payment when the security matures or debt is serviced this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments 

• investment counterparty risk investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and thus fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral to securities of high quality issuers when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements our clearing houses take delivery of the securities underlying the reverse repurchase arrangement in custody accounts under clearing house control additionally the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount the typical haircut for high quality sovereign debt is 2 of the reverse repurchase amount which provides additional excess collateral thus in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the counterparty’s obligation 

the ice clearing houses may use thirdparty investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house such advisors do not hold clearing member cash or cash equivalent deposits or the underlying investments clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians the ice clearing houses employ or may employ multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives 

• crosscurrency margin deposit risk each of the ice clearing houses may permit posting of crosscurrency collateral to satisfy margin requirements for example accepting margin deposits denominated in us dollars to secure a euro margin obligation the ice clearing houses mitigate the risk of a currency value exposure by applying a “haircut” to the currency posted as margin at a level viewed as sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of currency volatility crosscurrency balances are markedtomarket on a daily basis should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a sameday basis 

impact of inflation 

we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant in the event of inflation we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants as the prices that we charge are not governed by longterm contracts

regulatory changes 

domestic and foreign policy makers continue to review their legal frameworks governing financial markets and periodically change the laws and regulations that apply to our business and to our customers’ businesses our key areas of focus on these evolving efforts are 

• brexit implications on january 1 2021 the uk completed its withdrawal from the eu commonly referred to as brexit as a result as of january 1 2021 eu law no longer applies in and to the uk in connection with the completion of the uks withdrawal the uk and eu finalized a trade and cooperation agreement which was provisionally applied as of january 1 2021 the trade and cooperation agreement does not cover financial services instead the uk and eu issued a joint declaration on financial services regulatory cooperation according to the joint declaration the uk and eu should agree on a memorandum of understanding establishing the framework for regulatory cooperation on financial services 

• requirement that european and uk exchanges and ccps offer nondiscriminatory access the nondiscriminatory access provisions of the uks markets in financial instruments directive ii or uk mifid ii and the eu markets in financial instruments directive ii or eu mifid ii would require both our uk and european 

exchanges and ccps to offer access to third parties on commercially reasonable terms in addition both the uk mifid ii and the eu mifid ii could require our uk and european exchanges and ccps to allow participants to trade andor clear at other venues which may encourage competing venues to offer lookalikes of our products on july 3 2020 the application of these nondiscriminatory access requirements for eu exchangetraded derivatives under eu mifid ii was postponed until july 3 2021 this postponement did not form part of eu law retained by the uk at the end of the brexit transition period uk treasury is currently reviewing the suitability of these requirements for uk markets 

• continued access by eu market participants to uk ccps and exchanges  the european commission or ec adopted an 18month temporary equivalence decision for uk ccps which began to apply as of january 1 2021 ice clear europe has been recognized by esma as a thirdcountry ccp in accordance with the european markets infrastructure regulation or emir separately ice futures europe and ice endex will continue to be able to permit access by eu and uk persons to transact on their platforms the absence of an equivalence decision by the eu for uk trading venues however may result in increased costs for certain eu market participants which could impact trading on ice futures europe the impact to our business and the potential for regulatory changes remain uncertain at this time we are monitoring the impact to our business and are evaluating avenues to facilitate continued access for eu and uk customers to ice futures europe and ice endex 

• regulatory structure applicable to noneu clearing houses on january 1 2020 emir 22 became effective which revises the eus current regulatory and supervisory structure for eu and noneu clearing houses esma has recognized ice clear europe as a thirdcountry ccp under emir and determined that it is a tier 2 ccp on the basis that it is systemically important to the financial stability of the eu or one or more of its member states however esmas continuing implementation of these delegated regulations could still impact one or more of our other noneu clearing houses 

• basel iii capital charges the implementation of capital charges in basel iii could have a negative impact on certain of our clearing members in particular the supplemental leverage ratio applicable to certain financial institutions may impose capital requirements on certain of our clearing house members and their customers that may raise the costs and thus discourage financial institutions from client clearing in june 2019 the basel committee on banking supervision revised its treatment of the leverage ratio capital requirement for derivatives that a bank centrally clears on behalf of its clients the revised treatment will permit both cash and noncash forms of initial margin and variation margin received from a client to offset the replacement cost and potential future exposure for client cleared derivatives only the revision will apply to the version of the leverage ratio standard that will serve as the pillar 1 minimum capital requirement as of january 1 2022 in november 2019 the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation or fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency finalized rule changes to the derivative exposure calculations and leverage ratio requirements the final rule also revised the treatment of the leverage ratio capital requirement for derivatives that a bank centrally clears on behalf of its clients to permit both cash and noncash forms of initial margin and variation margin received from a client to offset the replacement cost and potential future exposure for client cleared derivatives only the compliance date for the revised regulation is january 1 2022 however early adoption was permitted beginning april 1 2020 

• capital requirements for investment firms acting as market makers eu and uk policy makers are developing a framework for prudential requirements for eu and uk investment firms the proposed rules risk imposing disproportionate capital requirements on eu and uk investment firms acting as market makers eu and uk investment firms may be discouraged from acting as market makers on certain markets operated by ice futures europe and ice endex due to the increased capital requirements 

• financial transaction and similar taxes a number of eu member states have considered a financial transaction tax but many details remain to be discussed and agreed including how to assess the tax at a member state level implementation of a financial transaction tax could result in a reduction in volumes and liquidity which would have a negative impact on our eu operations 

in the us financial transaction taxes and other similar changes to tax laws are being considered in several states and a federal financial transaction tax on stocks bonds and derivatives has been introduced in the us house of representatives as in the eu these types of taxes in the us could result in reduced volumes and liquidity on our exchanges that trade instruments to which the tax applies 

• benchmarks regulation in june 2016 the eu bmr entered into force and the majority of provisions applied from january 2018 under the eu bmr benchmarks provided by a thirdcountry ie noneu benchmark administrator may be used by eusupervised entities provided that the ec has adopted an equivalence decision or the administrator has been recognized or endorsed and the benchmarks are listed on the register established by esma the eu bmr also provides for a transition period until december 31 2021 allowing index providers to continue to provide critical benchmarks and for supervised entities to continue to utilize benchmarks provided by thirdcountry 

administrators there are proposals to further extend the transition period for the use of benchmarks provided by thirdcountry administrators until at least december 31 2023 subject to final approval by the european parliament 

from april 27 2018 to december 31 2020 iba was authorized as a benchmark administrator under the eu bmr as of january 1 2021 iba is authorized as a benchmark administrator under the uk bmr and benchmarks provided by iba may continue to be used by supervised entities in the eu under the eu bmr transitional provisions from may 24 2019 to december 31 2020 ice data indices was recognized by the fca as a thirdcountry benchmark administrator under the eu bmr as of january 1 2021 ice data indices is recognized as a thirdcountry benchmark administrator under the uk bmr and benchmarks provided by ice data indices may continue to be used by supervised entities in the eu under the eu bmr transitional provisions 

in october 2020 the uk government introduced the financial services bill which includes proposed amendments to the uk bmr to provide the fca with authority to manage and direct any winddown period prior to a cessation of the london interbank offered rate or libor including powers to direct a methodology change for a critical benchmark and extend its publication on a basis that is no longer representative of its original underlying market or economic reality legislation increasing the powers of regulators to change the methodology or underlying market represented by a benchmark or extend the publication of a benchmark including libor could result in increased risks to administrators such as iba and users of such benchmarks in november 2020 the european parliament and council reached an agreement on amending the eu bmr to provide the ec the power to designate a replacement benchmark that covers all references to a widely used reference rate that is phased out including libor when necessary to avoid disruption of the financial markets in the eu 

• market data requirements our uk and eu derivatives exchanges could be impacted by changes to requirements related to the dissemination of market data in its december 2019 report to the ec esma recommended against among other things outright regulation of market data prices however esma suggested that users could gain transparency into how market data prices are set with the help of new supervisory guidance and targeted changes to the mifid iimarkets in financial instruments regulation or mifir text the ec is considering esma’s report and is considering further legislative action in this area additionally the fca launched the accessing and using wholesale data call for input” which will explore the changing use and value of data in wholesale financial markets 

as required by a may 2020 sec order in august 2020 the exchanges and finra submitted to the sec a proposed new single nms plan to replace the three existing nms plans that govern the dissemination of realtime consolidated equity market data for exchangelisted cash equity securities this proposed new single nms plan would not replace the current nms plans until it is approved by the sec and a transition period concludes approval of the new nms plan by the sec may affect nyses revenues from the sale of consolidated market data since all the market data fees for consolidated market data would be required to be refiled with the sec and would not be effective until approved separately in june 2020 nyse nasdaq and cboe filed petitions for review with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia of the sec order requiring the exchanges and finra to file this new nms plan 

in december 2020 the sec finalized a rule that would significantly change the content of consolidated data and the manner in which it is collected consolidated and disseminated there is a lengthy phase in of these rules of more than two years the final rule replaces the current exclusive processor for collecting consolidating and disseminating cash equity market data with competing multiple processors nyse currently operates the exclusive processor for securities listed on the nyse exchanges and cboe and will no longer receive revenue for this activity once the final rule is fully implemented in addition the final rule adds new depth of book and auction content to the information that is consolidated it is uncertain the fees that exchanges will be permitted to charge competing consolidators and others for market data that is included within the new definition of consolidated market data and there could be an impact on nyse’s revenues from the sale of market data 

• regulation of services offered by nonexchange affiliates  in an october 2020 order approving certain wireless services filed by the nyse exchanges the sec expressed an expanded interpretation of what constitutes an “exchange” or a “facility” of an exchange under the us securities laws to the extent that services offered by nonexchange affiliates of the nyse exchanges are considered by the sec to be subject to regulations applicable to registered securities exchanges such services and the fees for such services would have to be filed with the sec which could impact the types of services we may offer and the revenues we receive from such services we have filed a petition for review of this order with the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 

• us listing and trading prohibitions on certain foreign companies on december 18 2020 the holding foreign companies accountable act became us law for each company required to file periodic reports with the sec this act requires the sec to identify any company that retains a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the public company accounting oversight board or pcaob is unable to inspect or investigate because of a position taken in such foreign jurisdiction if the sec determines that the pcaob has been 

unable to inspect or investigate such accounting firm for three consecutive years it is required to prohibit such company from trading its securities on a us securities exchange or in any “overthecounter” market as a consequence the nyse exchanges may be required to suspend trading in certain of their listed companies 

in addition on november 12 2020 the former president of the united states issued an executive order that prohibits subject to certain exceptions transactions by us persons in the securities of certain chinese companies identified as having ties to the peoples liberation army and in securities that are derivatives of or any securities that are designated to provide investment exposure to such chinese companies to comply with the executive order and guidance from the us department of the treasury the nyse suspended trading in three of its listed companies and commenced delisting proceedings in the future there may be other listed companies that the nyse will be required to take similar action to comply with the executive order

• cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to bakkt’s reputation business and financial condition 

business and industry 

global economic political and financial market events or conditions may negatively impact our business 

adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment government shutdowns currency fluctuations interest rate changes geopolitical events climate change international trade disputes including the imposition of tariffs or other protectionist measures actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade have in the past negatively impacted consumer and corporate confidence and resulted in reductions in consumer government and corporate spending and could have such effects in the future and in turn impact our business if our customers reduce spending workforce trading activity or demand for financial data as a result of challenges in the prevailing economic markets our revenues could decline 

a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from data services fees and fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets our market databased revenues are largely subscriptionbased or recurring and are generated from a range of global financial and commodity markets including pricing and reference data exchange data analytics feeds index services desktops and connectivity solutions for our transactionbased revenues we derive a significant percentage from trading in global energy and agriculturalrelated futures and options contracts as well as equity transactions and global interest rate contracts the market data subscriptions and trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of spending or trading activity for any reason including 

• adverse market conditions that curtail the addition of new customers or cause a decrease in purchases by our existing customers for our subscriptionbased products and services 

• weakness in the macroeconomic environment that causes our customers to delay or cancel existing orders or subscriptions 

• costcutting pressures across the industry or decrease in demand for our subscriptionbased products and services that lead to a reduction in price 

• consolidation in our markets or the markets of our customers that results in a reduction in the number of market participants 

• a reduction in trading demand by customers or a decision to curtail or cease hedging or speculative trading 

• regulatory or legislative changes impacting our business our customers and financial markets 

• political uncertainty and discord could negatively impact us if we are viewed as taking a political stance that is contrary to our customers beliefs or principles 

• the impact of climate change and the transition to renewable energy and away from crude oil 

• a prolonged decrease in volatility in the financial markets 

• heightened capital requirements or mandated reductions in leverage resulting from new regulations 

• defaults by clearing or exchange members or the inability of participants to pay out contractual obligations 

• changes to our contract specifications that are not viewed favorably by our market participants or 

• reduced access to or availability of capital required to fund trading activities 

a reduction in our overall trading volume could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenues a reduction in trading volumes could also result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for our market data which would further reduce our overall revenue 

further nyse’s revenue increases when more companies are seeking access to public markets and on the nyse specifically a stagnation or a decline in the initial public offering or ipo market or issuers choosing to list on venues other than the nyse could have an adverse effect on our revenues 

uschina trade and diplomatic tensions us government policies toward china including sanctions laws and regulations and chinese government policies toward us companies may impact our existing business and future opportunities as well as affect chinese companies’ ability to do business with us 

in addition adverse conditions in the residential mortgage lending industry including a substantial or prolonged decline in mortgage lending volume may have an adverse effect on our revenues mortgage lending volume has decreased substantially in certain years in the past and could again decrease in the future factors that could adversely impact mortgage lending volumes include increased mortgage interest rates reduced consumer and investor demand for mortgages more stringent underwriting guidelines decreased liquidity in the secondary mortgage market high levels of unemployment high levels of consumer debt lower consumer confidence changes in tax and other regulatory policies the number of existing mortgages eligible for refinancing the available inventory of housing affordability of housing and other macroeconomic factors 

owning clearing houses exposes us to risks including risks related to defaults by clearing members risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses 

there are risks inherent in operating clearing houses including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members market liquidity risks defaults by clearing members and risks associated with custody and investing margin or guaranty fund assets provided by clearing members to our clearing houses which could subject our business to substantial losses for example clearing members in ice clear europe have provided margin and guaranty funds with an aggregate cash balance of 381 billion as of december 31 2020 and a total of 841 billion for all of our clearing houses as of december 31 2020 in addition to the use of sovereign central bank access when applicable the ice clearing houses may use thirdparty investment advisors for investment of cash assets subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house and may add or change the investment managers from time to time to the extent available ice clear credit holds the us dollar cash and us treasuries that clearing members transfer to satisfy their original margin and guaranty fund requirements at its account at the federal reserve with respect to other clearing member cash posted ice clear credit currently selfmanages and uses external investment managers to invest such cash margin and guaranty fund deposits 

we have an obligation to return margin payments and guaranty fund contributions to clearing members to the extent that the relevant member’s risk based on its open contracts to the clearing house is reduced if a number of clearing members substantially reduce their open interest or default the concentration of risks within our clearing houses will be spread among a smaller pool of clearing members which would make it more difficult to absorb and manage risk in the event of a further clearing member’s default 

although our clearing houses have policies and procedures to help ensure that clearing members can satisfy their obligations such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a members or counterparty’s default in addition although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards it is a complex process and there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect us from the risks related to clearing these products we cannot assure you these measures and safeguards will be sufficient to protect us 

from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default we have contributed our own capital to the front of the guaranty fund of the clearing houses that could be used in the event of a default furthermore in 2019 we added a layer of insurance to our clearing member default protection the default insurance layer resides after and in addition to the ice clear credit ice clear europe and ice clear us ‘skin in the game’ contributions and before the guaranty fund contributions of the nondefaulting clearing members the default insurance has a threeyear term subject to renewal notwithstanding these actions the default of any one of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and cause our customers to lose confidence in the guaranty of our clearing houses 

a decline in the value of securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions by our clearing houses or default by a sovereign government issuer could pose additional risks of default by clearing members 

our clearing houses hold a substantial amount of assets as margin or guaranty fund contributions which comprise us and other sovereign treasury securities as of december 31 2020 our clearing houses held 673 billion of noncash margin or guaranty fund contributions in us and other sovereign treasury securities 507 billion of this amount was comprised of us treasury securities 26 billion of french treasury securities 22 billion of german treasury securities 24 billion of uk treasury securities and 94 billion of other european japanese and triparty treasury securities sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest and most liquid securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived credit worthiness of major governments however the markets for such securities have experienced significant volatility during the past decade due to ongoing financial challenges in some of the major european countries and the us government’s negotiations regarding taxation spending cuts and raising the debt ceiling which is the maximum amount of debt that the us government can legally incur in addition if there is a collapse in a specific currency relied upon by our clearing houses our clearing houses would face significant expenses in changing their systems and such an event could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates to mitigate this risk our clearing houses currently apply a discount or “haircut” to the market values for all sovereign securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions however market conditions could change more quickly than we adjust the amount of the haircuts and the haircuts could be insufficient in the event of a sudden market event 

if the value of these securities declines significantly our clearing houses will need to collect additional margin or guaranty fund contributions from their clearing members which may be difficult for the members to supply in a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government if a clearing member cannot supply the additional margin or guaranty fund contributions which may include cash in a currency acceptable to the clearing house the clearing house would deem the clearing member in default if any clearing members default as a result of the reduction in the value of margin or guaranty fund contributions our clearing houses and trading business could suffer substantial losses as a result of the loss of any capital that has been contributed to the clearing house’s guaranty funds and a loss of confidence by clearing members in the clearing house resulting in a reduction in volumes of future cleared transactions 

further our clearing houses invest large sums through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions in the event that a reverse repo counterparty defaults the value of the sovereign securities we hold as collateral might not be sufficient to cover our losses our clearing houses may also make demand deposits with banks that are secured only to the value of fdic insurance or other national deposit guarantee schemes which is small and therefore the deposits may in significant part be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent 

owning and operating cash equity and options exchanges exposes us to additional risks including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject 

owning and operating cash equity and options exchanges for which the revenues are primarily derived from trading activity market data and listing fees exposes us to additional risks adverse economic conditions and legal and regulatory changes similar to those discussed elsewhere in this section could result in decreased trading volume on our exchanges discourage or prohibit market participants from listing on our exchanges or cause them to forgo new offerings any of these could reduce our revenues including market data and listing fee revenue 

our cash equity and options exchanges also have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled for example these exchanges are responsible for enforcing listed company compliance with applicable listing standards enforcing our members compliance with exchange rules and federal securities laws complying with terms of nms plans filing of all material changes to exchanges rules with the sec and operating our exchanges consistent with exchange rules federal securities laws and other applicable laws any failure by one of our exchanges to comply with and enforce compliance by their members with exchange rules and securities laws could significantly harm our reputation prompt regulatory scrutiny 

result in the payment of fines or penalties and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our ability to do this could be impaired by for example recent sec amendments to nms plans for the consolidation of market data that impede the ability of the exchanges and finra to discharge their legal obligations by restricting the flow of information and constraining the decisionmaking authority of the exchanges and finra 

we must allocate significant resources to fulfill our regulatory and selfregulatory responsibilities the forprofit exchanges’ goal of maximizing stockholder value might contradict the exchanges’ regulatory and selfregulatory responsibilities in addition the listing of our common stock on the nyse could potentially create a conflict between the exchange’s regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities on the one hand and our commercial and economic interest on the other hand while we have structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful 

further changes in the rules of our securities markets must be reviewed and approved by the sec approval of such changes by the sec cannot be guaranteed and the sec could delay either the approval process or the initiation of the public comment process any denial or delay in approving changes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding regulatory changes impacting our cash equities and options exchanges including risks to our business associated with possible regulation of services offered by nonexchange affiliates and us listing and trading prohibitions on certain foreign companies 

our business is subject to the impact of financial markets volatility including the prices and interest rates underlying our derivative products or which impact mortgage origination volumes due to conditions that are beyond our control 

trading volume in our markets and products is largely driven by the degree of volatility  the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations  in prices and levels of the underlying commodities securities indices financial benchmarks or other instruments volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates opportunities for investment and speculative or arbitrage trading were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices or levels of the underlying commodities securities indices benchmarks or other instruments of our products we could experience lower trading volumes slower growth or declines in revenues 

factors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility and thus trading volumes include 

• global economic political and market conditions 

• concerns over inflation deflation legislative and regulatory changes government fiscal and monetary policy  including actions by the federal reserve and other foreign monetary units governing bodies and investor and consumer confidence levels 

• weather conditions including hurricanes and other significant events natural and unnatural disasters like large oil spills that impact the production of commodities and in the case of energy commodities production refining and distribution facilities for oil and natural gas 

• war acts of terrorism and any unforeseen market closures or disruptions in trading 

• political developments impacting international trade including continued uncertainty surrounding the implementation of brexit trade disputes and increased tariffs particularly between the us and china and imposition of protectionist measures 

• real and perceived changes in the supply and demand of commodities underlying our products particularly energy and agricultural products including changes as a result of technological improvements or the development of alternative energy sources and 

• credit quality of market participants the availability of capital and the levels of assets under management 

any one or more of these factors which are beyond our control may reduce trading activity which could make our markets less attractive as a source of liquidity and in turn could further discourage existing and potential market participants and thus accelerate a decline in the level of trading activity and potentially related services such as data or clearing further lower market volatility could also result in more exchanges competing for trading volumes to maintain their growth if any of these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets could be jeopardized because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our current products and services 

decline for any reason we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues which would cause our net income to decline 

systems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry could negatively impact us 

highprofile system failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our business and result in a loss of confidence in our technology and our markets regulatory investigations fines and penalties and business activity slowdown or interruptions further regulators have imposed requirements for trading platforms that have been costly for us to implement and could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services in particular the sec’s regulation systems compliance and integrity or regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations subject portions of our securities and derivatives trading platforms and other technological systems related to our clearing houses trade repositories and the us swap execution facility or sef to extensive regulation and oversight ensuring our compliance with the requirements of regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations requires significant ongoing administrative and compliance expenses and burdens in addition the sec’s expansion of the ice systems that are determined to be in scope for regulation sci could result in significant additional expenditures 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism including cyberterrorism than other companies 

given our prominence in the global securities industry and the location of many of our properties and personnel in us and european financial centers including lower manhattan we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees in addition terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets including trading on exchanges any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results 

since we conduct operations in several different countries including the us uk and canada as well as the eu substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling canadian dollars and euros because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies could affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

external events such as brexit and the negotiations regarding the terms thereof and the passage of us taxation reform legislation have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially among the us dollar the british pound sterling and the euro if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the uk eu the us or other key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further the value of the pound sterling and euro and the global credit markets may further weaken general financial instability in countries in the eu could have a contagion effect on the region and contribute to the general instability and uncertainty in the eu events that adversely affect our uk and eu clients and suppliers could in turn have a materially adverse effect on our international business results and our operating results 

for additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk refer to “ foreign currency exchange rate risk” in item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk which is included in this annual report 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we have achieved significant growth since becoming a public company in 2005 our growth is highly dependent on customer demand for our core products and services favorable economic conditions and our ability to invest in our personnel facilities infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls adverse economic conditions 

could reduce customer demand for our products and services which may place a significant strain on our management and resources and could force us to defer existing or future planned opportunities we regularly evaluate our existing operations service capacity and business efficiencies and as a result of such evaluations we may undertake strategic initiatives outside of and within our businesses we may not be successful in executing on our strategies to support our growth organically or through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances 

we may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities 

we from time to time launch and intend in the future to launch new products services and business ventures and continue to explore and pursue other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we have spent and may continue to spend substantial time and money developing new product or service offerings or improving current product or service offerings including for example our mortgage technology services if these offerings are not successful we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to recover the costs of such initiatives obtaining any required regulatory approval associated with these offerings may also result in delays or restrictions on our ability to benefit fully from these offerings further we have entered into and may seek in the future to enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry among other advantages introducing or maintaining our offerings in certain countries is also subject to a number of other risks including currency exchange rate risk difficulties enforcing agreements or collecting receivables longer payment cycles compliance with the laws or regulations of these countries and political and regulatory uncertainties 

in addition in light of consolidation in the exchange data services clearing and mortgage technology sectors and competition for opportunities we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully our competitors could merge making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors also offering new products and services and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives that are necessary for our success 

the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions globally and has led governmental authorities to take unprecedented measures to mitigate the spread of the disease including travel bans border closings business closures quarantines and shelterinplace orders and to take actions designed to stabilize markets and promote economic growth 

from an operational perspective the spread of covid19 has resulted in and could continue to result in temporary closures of our office facilities and the office facilities of our customers and our thirdparty vendors we have taken preventive measures and implemented contingency plans and currently most of our employees are working remotely however we cannot assure you that such measures will adequately protect our business and an extended period of remote work arrangements could heighten existing and introduce new operational risks including but not limited to cybersecurity risk and could strain our technological resources and business continuity plans if one or more of the thirdparty vendors to whom we outsource certain material activities claim that they cannot perform due to a force majeure or experience operational failures as a result of the covid19 pandemic it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition further although we maintain contingency plans for events such as pandemic outbreaks the further spread of covid19 could impact the availability of our executive officers and other key employees who are necessary to conduct our business 

the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend largely on future developments including among other things the widespread distribution acceptance and effectiveness of a vaccine which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time delays in the widespread distribution of a vaccine or lack of public acceptance of a vaccine could have an adverse effect on the global economy further even if a vaccine is widely distributed and accepted there can be no assurance that the vaccine will ultimately be successful in limiting or stopping the spread of covid19 a prolonged economic downturn could have an adverse effect on our revenues related to certain activities such as a decline in demand for certain data products and a decline in ipos the covid19 pandemic could also have an adverse impact on our customers’ businesses risk management needs and ability to trade and the resulting impact on our business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

while governmental organizations are engaging in efforts to combat the spread and severity of covid19 these measures may not be effective moreover actions taken by us or other governmental authorities that are intended to 

ameliorate the macroeconomic or other effects of covid19 or delays in the announcement or implementation of regulatory measures that had been pending prior to the covid19 pandemic have resulted in and may in the future result in regulatory uncertainty and could in turn impact our business at this time we cannot predict how legal and regulatory responses to concerns about covid19 will impact our business 

in addition to the extent that covid19 may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations it may also heighten other risks described in this section 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill other intangible assets or investments 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2020 we had goodwill of 213 billion and net other intangible assets of 144 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties 

during 2020 we did not record any impairments of our goodwill intangible assets or investments we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may result in these types of impairments an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill other intangible assets and other investments and assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 

for additional information on our goodwill other intangible assets and investments refer to notes 3 4 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements and “ critical accounting policies  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets” in item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which are included in this annual report 

legal and regulatory 

our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to extensive legislation and regulatory scrutiny and we face the risk of changes to our regulatory environment and business in the future 

we are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in many jurisdictions around the world and in particular in the us and the uk we face the risk of significant actions by regulatory and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments which may affect our business the activity of our market participants and our results among other things as a result of regulators and tax authorities enforcing existing laws and regulations we could be censured fined prohibited from pursuing certain acquisitions or engaging in some of our business activities subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities including fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory pricing restrictions also known as frand or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees including settlement payments interest payments and penalty payments in many cases our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions 

there is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could be imposed this could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients’ overall trading volume through our exchanges and demand for our market data mortgage technology and other services 

we are also subject to regulatory risks relating to the mortgage industry which is heavily regulated in the us changes to existing laws or regulations or adoption of new laws or regulations that affect the residential mortgage industry could reduce residential mortgage volume or otherwise limit the ability of users and participants of our mortgage technology services to operate their businesses resulting in decreased usage of our solutions alternatively reduced regulatory requirements could also reduce the demand for certain of our products and services which are intended to enable our customers to satisfy existing regulatory requirements in addition potential structural changes in the us residential mortgage industry in particular plans to diminish the role of fannie mae and freddie mac could disrupt the residential mortgage market and have a material adverse effect on our business 

there is also increasing public concern regarding data privacy and data protection and many jurisdictions have passed laws in this area such as the european union general data protection regulation the uk general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions the laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection are increasing in complexity and number 

change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us regulation of privacy and data protection often times require monitoring of and changes to our data practices in regard to the collection use disclosure storage transfer andor security of personal and sensitive information including the personal information of the customers of the users of the software and services provided by our ice mortgage technology business 

these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our stockholders and creditors 

us uk and eu legal and regulatory developments in particular emir emir 22 mifid ii and the bmr including each such regulation as incorporated into uk law and the doddfrank act have significantly altered and propose to further alter the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability these regulatory developments could also cause us to change our business practices restructure our businesses or move certain of our businesses and employees the enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes most likely to affect our businesses are nondiscriminatory access provisions of mifid ii interoperability and margin rules in emir enhanced regulatory capital liquidity and leverage rules in basel iii and capital requirements directive iv access rules under the bmr the nonharmonization of margin requirements implementation of a financial transaction tax access to our benchmarks and maintaining our exchanges’ abilities to operate as sros with related immunity for the discharge of their regulatory functions as the operator of global businesses the lack of harmonization in international financial reform efforts could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in multiple jurisdictions 

the doddfrank act established enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the fsoc ice clear credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the fsoc and as a result is subject to additional oversight by the cftc compliance with these requirements has resulted in and will continue to result in additional operating costs 

in 2016 the sec approved a plan to establish a marketwide consolidated audit trail or cat to improve regulators’ ability to monitor trading activity in 2018 the first phase of implementation went live and required sro participants to begin reporting to the cat in addition to increased risk in connection with our regulatory obligations implementation of the cat could result in significant additional expenditures which may not be reimbursed funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the sros and brokerdealers to date however funding has been provided solely by the sros partly in exchange for promissory notes which increases the risk that sros including us will not be reimbursed for costs expended to date due to delays and failures in implementation and functionality by the original plan processor we recorded promissory note impairment charges of 2 million and 16 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively we believe the risk that sros are not reimbursed has increased resulting in this impairment until the sec approves a funding model that shares the cost of the cat between the sros and brokerdealers the sros may continue to incur additional costs which may become significant and may not be reimbursed as of december 31 2020 we have accrued approximately 22 million as a receivable in connection with our portion of expenses related to the cat implementation 

we are subject to tax laws regulations rulings and audits in multiple us and nonus jurisdictions that could have a significant impact on our business and lead to additional expenditures for us or our customers for example there have been discussions in various jurisdictions around financial transaction or digital service tax frameworks changes to tax frameworks in jurisdictions where we operate significant business for example in new jersey new york the eu or federally in the us has the potential to increase costs to us or to our market participants and discourage participation in the markets we operate furthermore implementation of any new or amended tax laws or regulations could impact our global operations or trading volumes 

other enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations 

our compliance and risk management methods as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations might not be effective which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators 

our ability to comply with existing rules regulations and laws and changing rules regulations and laws largely depends on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel regulators periodically review our ability to selfregulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including selfregulatory standards certain of our businesses associated with the nyse are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations policies and procedures if we fail to comply with any of these obligations regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business 

our acquisitions expose us to new regulatory requirements for example as a result of our acquisition of interactive data we operate an secregistered investment adviser investment advisers are subject to significant regulatory obligations under the investment advisers act prior to this acquisition none of our businesses were registered under the investment advisers act compliance with the investment advisers act and other regulatory requirements gives rise to costs and expenses that may be material in addition our acquisition of the bondpoint ats in january 2018 and our acquisition of tmc bonds in july 2018 exposes us to increased exposure to regulatory scrutiny from the sec finra and msrb our acquisition of ellie mae in 2020 exposes us to increased exposure to regulatory scrutiny from us regulatory bodies which regulate the us residential mortgage industry including the ffiec and its member agencies including among others the cfpb 

our regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders embargo future business activity or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses we have settled certain regulatory actions in the past including ice data pricing  reference data llc’s settlement with the sec in november 2020 in which we agreed to pay an 8 million civil monetary penalty we continue to face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity of our business any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our financial condition operating results or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined to be in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business further any settlement consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or regulatory agencies begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities finally the implementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to remain competitive and grow our business 

regulatory changes or court rulings may have an adverse impact on our ability to derive revenue from market data and connectivity fees 

regulatory developments or court rulings could reduce the amount of revenue that we obtain from exchange market data and connectivity fees related to our us equity and options exchanges with respect to our us equities and equity options exchanges our ability to assess fees for market data products and certain connectivity fees are subject to review by the sec there continues to be opposing industry viewpoints and litigation as to the extent that our us equities and equity options exchanges should be able to charge for market data and market access and the manner in which we set such exchange fees could be reassessed 

if new constraints are placed on our ability to charge for market data or market access in the us it could have a negative impact on our revenues we cannot predict whether or in what form any regulatory or other changes will take effect or their impact on our business a determination by the sec or a court for example that the sec must link market data fees to marginal costs take a more active role in the market data ratesetting process or reduce the current levels of market data fees could have an adverse effect on our market data revenues 

separately our european exchanges are currently authorized to sell trade information on a nondiscriminatory basis at a reasonable cost this regulatory position could be modified or interpreted by the ec or future european court decisions in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our european market data revenues 

in addition the fca and iosco have both issued consultations to explore access to market data in financial markets the results of these consultations may lead to a regulatory response that could affect our business similar to the us if new constraints are placed on our ability to charge for market data or market access in the uk or other jurisdictions it could have a negative impact on our revenues 

the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the uks exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

in 2016 voters in the uk approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit brexit has created political and economic uncertainty and instability in the global markets including currency and credit markets particularly in the uk and eu in addition political and economic uncertainty surrounding the future relationship of the uk and eu could lead to certain macroeconomic conditions that adversely affect our business adverse macroeconomic consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates legal uncertainty potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or enactment of replicate andor prohibitive laws and regulations that may adversely affect both demand for our products and services and our ability to deliver our products and services into the eu the longterm effects of brexit will depend in part on the agreement the uk made to retain access to eu markets 

following the formation of a majority conservative government in december 2019 the uk withdrew from the eu on january 31 2020 and completed its withdrawal on january 1 2021 prior to completing its withdrawal in december 2020 the uk and eu agreed to a trade and cooperation agreement which was provisionally applied as of january 1 2021 this agreement governs the euuk relationship after the completion of the uk’s exit from the eu the ukeu brexit deal does not provide a transition period for financial services or any new arrangements to replace the existing “passport” this leaves both the uk and eu to address matters of access in financial services through declarations of equivalence under existing equivalence regimes contained in uk and eu law and through domestic laws the ec has however adopted an 18month temporary equivalence decision for uk ccps which applies beginning on january 1 2021 ice clear europe has been recognized by esma as a thirdcountry ccp in accordance with emir 

as a result of the trade and cooperation agreement not providing free trade arrangements for financial services any equivalence determinations or any further transition period for financial services could include restrictions on access to our services by persons located in the eu or make access more expensive which could adversely affect our operations and profitability or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions the consequences of brexit and the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement could also cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding brexit including risks to our business associated with brexit 

risks relating to the administration of benchmarks and indices including libor and the potential for changes to cessations of and the replacement of or transition from benchmarks and indices including libor may result in legal risks and could adversely affect our business 

certain of our subsidiaries produce and license multiple global benchmarks and indices across asset classes which are referenced in certain of our trading and clearing products to ensure continued trading and clearing in these benchmarkrelated products and the continued licensing and use of these benchmarks and indices our subsidiaries must be able to demonstrate that these benchmarks and indices are administered with integrity and are not readily subject to manipulation and must also continue to evolve these benchmarks and indices as necessary to maintain their reliability and relevance as an example our subsidiary iba is the administrator of various global benchmarks including libor iba assumed the administration of libor following various cases of attempted manipulation and misconduct related to the libor benchmark that emerged following the financial crisis any failures negative publicity or lawsuits related to our subsidiaries administration of benchmarks and indices including libor could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and indices and could harm our business and our reputation 

changes to cessations of and the replacement of or transition from our subsidiaries benchmarks and indices including libor or any other changes or reforms to the determination or administration of such benchmarks and indices could result in legal risks risks to our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results in july 2017 the fca stated its intention that it would no longer be necessary to sustain libor through its influence or legal powers beyond 2021 the fca and global regulators have since advocated for a transition from libor to alternative rates by the end of 2021 on december 4 2020 iba published a consultation on its intention to cease the publication of i all gbp eur chf and jpy libor settings and the 1 week and 2 month usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on december 31 2021 and ii the overnight and 1 3 6 and 12 month usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on june 30 2023 subject to any rights of the fca to compel iba to continue publication the consultation closed on january 25 2021 and iba intends to share the results of the consultation with the fca and to publish a feedback statement summarizing responses from the consultation 

in october 2020 the uk government introduced the financial services bill which includes proposed uk legislation to ensure that the fca has appropriate regulatory powers to manage and direct any winddown period prior to eventual libor cessation the new proposed powers would allow the fca to compel iba to publish critical benchmarks such as libor under a new methodology that is no longer representative of the underlying market that the benchmark currently measures and also to restrict the use of critical benchmarks such as libor subject to such changes or in respect of which the administrator has confirmed its intention to cease the benchmark 

we continue to monitor industry and regulatory developments but it is not yet possible to predict with certainty how the transition from and any potential cessations of libor will proceed and how the proposed new powers of the fca will be implemented and what effect the transition from and any potential exercise of new fca powers in relation to libor may have on the markets that use the benchmark today 

we may face liability for content contained in our data products and services 

we have been and may in the future be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation libel copyright or trademark infringement fraud or negligence or based on other theories of liability in each case relating to the data articles commentary ratings information or other content we distribute in our financial data services if such data or other content or information that we distribute has errors is delayed or has design defects we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our corporate website or those websites that we own and operate through links to other websites use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for significant amounts any such claim even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us could involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and a negative impact on our reputation 

in addition we license and redistribute data and content from various third parties and the terms of these licenses change frequently our thirdparty data and content suppliers may audit our use of and our clients’ use of and payment for data and content from time to time in the ordinary course of business including audits currently underway such thirdparty data and content suppliers have asserted and may in the future assert that we or our clients owe additional amounts under the terms of the applicable license agreements that we inappropriately distributed the thirdparty data or that we or our clients used the data or content in a manner that exceeded the scope of the applicable license agreement or without a license agreement see the discussion on the trademark infringement and breach of contract claims from cme group inc or cme under the caption span trademark dispute in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report we have and expect to continue to spend and allocate resources to develop and acquire the use of technology and other intellectual property rights to manage these risks and track thirdparty data usage but we cannot be assured that we will not incur liability we may incur costs to investigate any allegations and may be required to pay damages to or make unexpected settlement payments to these data and content suppliers and these costs and payments could be material 

we are subject to significant litigation and liability risks 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our participants involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred for example dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platforms or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades abusive trading practices security and confidentiality breaches mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants in addition because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by entering them inaccurately a large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets 

in addition we are subject to ongoing legal disputes that could result in the payment of fines penalties or damages and could expose us to additional liability in the future see item 3 legal proceedings in this annual report for a general description of our legal proceedings and claims and note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for a summary of specific legal proceedings under the captions city of providence litigation libor litigation ice data pricing  reference data matter and span trademark dispute while ice intends to vigorously defend these specific matters the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be determined and adverse rulings in these matters could impact our financial condition and continued operations 

further we could incur significant expenses defending the claims mentioned above and any future claims even those without merit which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us including those we are involved with due to acquisition activity may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we may have to establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change 

operational and liquidity 

our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cyberattacks hacking and other cybersecurity risks which could result in wrongful manipulation disclosure destruction or use of our information or that of a third party or which could make our participants unable or reluctant to use our electronic platforms 

the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to reliably transact on our electronic platforms and provide financial data services are critical elements of our operations some of our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential client and other data including client portfolio information if anyone gains improper access to our electronic platforms networks or databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify our confidential information or that of a third party breaches of our cybersecurity measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business our networks and those of our participants thirdparty service providers and external market infrastructures may be vulnerable to compromise unauthorized access security technology failure computer viruses social engineering denial of service attacks terrorism ransomware attacks firewall or encryption failures or other security problems resulting in loss of data integrity information disclosure unavailability or fraud the financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of political protest activism and financial gain and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for cyberattack and other information security threats further former employees of companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly 

although we have not been subject to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity events including distributed denial of service or ddos attacks malware infections phishing web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size for example we experienced ddos attempts brand misuse social media impersonation and phishing attempts directed toward employee systems and personal email accounts during 2020 while we operate an information security program that is designed to prevent detect track and mitigate cyber incidents and that has detected and mitigated such incidents in the past we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against future attacks any such attacks could result in reputational damage cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose customers cause us to experience lower current and future trading volumes or incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive position in addition given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or disable or degrade systems a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected and we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely the extent of a particular cyber incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while such an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it which may compound damages before the incident is discovered or remediated additionally as threats continue to evolve and increase and as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities which could adversely impact our net income 

following the acquisition of ellie mae whose systems process and host millions of us residential mortgages each year resulting in a larger attack surface our exposure to personally identifiable information or pii has increased failure to maintain the security of the confidential information of the customers of the users of our software and services could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and operating results 

further cybersecurity threats to and incidents involving vendors and other thirdparties who support our activities  particularly those with lesssophisticated defenses  could impact us for example although we did not experience any material impacts from the solarwinds orion cybersecurity breach that was widely publicized in december 2020 we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may be material 

our business may be harmed by computer and communication systems failures and delays 

our business depends on the integrity reliability and security of our infrastructure which is highly dependent on our computer and communication systems our customers rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate and highquality financial market data analytics and related solutions our timely reliable delivery of highquality products and services is dependent upon an array of technical production processes that enable our content delivery platforms our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans including our ability to recover from the loss of one of our primary data centers may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach our systems or those of our thirdparty providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

• unanticipated disruption in service to our participants 

• slower response time and delays in our participants’ trade execution and processing 

• failed settlement by participants to whom we provide trade confirmation or clearing services 

• incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades 

• failure to complete the clearing house margin settlement process resulting in significant financial risk 

• distribution of inaccurate or untimely market data to participants who rely on this data in their trading activity 

• disruption to ice mortgage technology and loan origination systems and 

• financial loss to us or those who depend on our systems and data 

we have experienced system failures in the past due to telecommunication failures and hardware and software malfunctions and defects and could experience future system failures due to power or telecommunications failures human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyberattacks intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar events these situations could result in damage to our business reputation and participant dissatisfaction with our electronic platform which could prompt participants to trade elsewhere or expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions as a consequence our business financial condition and operating results could suffer materially 

our regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses could be adversely affected 

an interruption or cessation of an important service data or content supplied by any third party or the loss of an exclusive license could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as online service providers hosting service and software providers data processors data centers software and hardware vendors banks local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading clearing data services mortgage technology applications and other systems we rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with third parties and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for the provision of hosting services we also depend on thirdparty suppliers for data and content including data received from certain competitors clients various government and public record services and financial institutions used in our products and services some of this data is exclusive to particular suppliers and may not be obtained from other suppliers in addition our data suppliers could enter into exclusive contracts with our competitors without our knowledge the general trend toward industry consolidation may increase the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future if these companies were to experience difficulties discontinue providing services to us for any reason or be unable to or fail to provide the type of service agreed to for any reason we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines or damage to our reputation it could require a significant amount of time to 

transition to new thirdparty service providers our thirdparty data suppliers perform audits on us from time to time in the ordinary course of business to determine if data we license for redistribution has been properly accounted for in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreement as a result of these audits we may incur additional expenses 

many of our clients also rely on third parties to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform if these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients’ inability to transact with our businesses we hold exclusive licenses to list various index futures and contracts in the future litigation or regulatory action may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and contracts trading to a single exchange and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license mifid ii introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of services relating to commodity derivatives across europe and the legislation requires open access to any benchmarks a benchmark is an index or other measure used to determine the value of a financial instrument for example libor or the sp 500 used in europe if unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive license were permitted we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products 

our success largely depends on key personnel including our senior management and having adequate succession plans in place we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business which could harm our business 

our future performance depends in large part on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel including our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel competition for key personnel in the various localities and business segments in which we operate is intense our ability to attract and retain key personnel in particular senior management will be dependent on a number of factors including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent there is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who we rely upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives the loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel could harm our business in particular we may have to incur costs to replace senior officers or other key employees who leave and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner 

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and restrict our activities or satisfy our debt service obligations 

as of december 31 2020 we had 165 billion of outstanding debt this level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt service obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our peers and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities as we use our available resources to reduce and refinance our consolidated debt our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue future business opportunities may be further restrained in addition the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio test and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other matters further a portion of our outstanding debt has historically been and continues to be in commercial paper which is subject to interest rate changes rising interest rates will result in an increase in our interest expense we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could materially affect our financial condition 

our longterm and shortterm debt is currently rated by moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s these ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time and it is possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade our credit ratings in the future in particular our inability to sustain reduced debt on a consolidated basis may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings following our acquisition of ellie mae and our associated borrowings moodys investor services and standard  poors reevaluated our credit ratings and lowered our ratings along with standard  poors placing us on negative outlook 

although these actions have not resulted in a material impact on our business or a material increase in borrowing costs a significant downgrade of our credit ratings in the future could impact customers’ willingness to use our clearing houses make parties less willing to do business with us and could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase the cost of our commercial paper and any future debt funding we may obtain 

competition 

we face intense competition failure to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences could negatively impact our competitive position 

we face intense competition in all aspects of our business and our competitors both domestic and international are numerous we currently compete with 

• regulated diversified futures exchanges globally that offer trading in a variety of asset classes similar to those offered by us such as energy agriculture equity and equity index credit and interest rate derivatives markets and foreign exchange 

• exchanges offering listing and trading of cash equities etfs closedend funds and other structured products similar to those offered by us 

• market data and information vendors 

• providers of digital solutions including providers of mortgage origination compliance pricing and documentation services 

• interdealer brokers active in the global credit derivatives markets 

• existing and newly formed electronic trading platforms service providers and other exchanges 

• other clearing houses and 

• consortiums of our customers members or market participants that may work together to achieve more favorable terms or pool their trading activity to establish new exchanges trading platforms or clearing facilities 

trends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings finally many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and ats businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business some of our competitors may have greater capital and resources offer a wide range of products and services or operate under less stringent regulatory regimes than we do 

in the mortgage technology sector we compete against other software providers as well as companies that offer “point of sale” or webbased online loan applications services we also compete with traditional methods of exchanging data and documents among mortgage industry participants such as email facsimile phone courier and mail mortgage originators may also manually upload loan data or enter information into each investor’s lender’s or service provider’s website in lieu of using our solutions there is vigorous competition among providers of mortgage technology services and we may be unsuccessful in differentiating our services to the extent necessary to effectively compete and may not succeed in convincing potential customers using other services or methods to switch to ours 

we also face pricing competition in many areas of our business a decline in our fees due to competitive pressure or regulatory changes the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for example our data service offerings have benefited from a high renewal rate in its subscriptionbased services but we cannot assure you that this will continue we also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings modify the pricing for our products or retain our current customers or attract new customers if we are not able to compete successfully our business could be materially impacted including our ability to remain as an operating entity 

our success depends on our ability to maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our technology to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary and acquired technology the financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change change in use patterns change in client preferences frequent product and service introductions and the emergence of new industry standards and practices these changes could render our 

existing proprietary technology uncompetitive or obsolete we have implemented a new trading technology system at nyse and if there are trading disruptions or if the new system has inadequate performance we could suffer material losses incur reputational damage or be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology to our clients’ requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and costeffective manner any failure to remain abreast of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to client preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our results 

damage to our reputation could damage our business 

our business is highly competitive and our customers typically have options on where to conduct their business our management team and business operations benefit from being highly regarded in our industry maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and for maintaining our relationships with our regulators negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services operations risk management compliance with regulations political affiliations or management team could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our existing business and business prospects 

intellectual property 

our use of open source software could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services and subject us to litigation 

we use some opensource software in our technology most often as small components within a larger product or service to augment algorithms functionalities or libraries we create and we may use more opensource software in the future opensource code is also contained in some thirdparty software we rely on we could be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of the license for such opensource software the terms of many opensource licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us or other courts and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services further opensource licensors generally do not provide technology support maintenance warranties or assurance of title or controls on the origin of the software which can also lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties including trademarks service marks trade names trade secrets copyrights and patents we cannot assure you that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property additionally we may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively further we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights which may require significant financial and managerial resources as a result we may choose not to enforce our infringed intellectual property rights depending on our strategic evaluation and judgment regarding the best use of our resources the relative strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the recourse available to us 

in addition our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may have obtained and may be expected to obtain in the future patent and intellectual property rights related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents and intellectual property rights that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services as a result we may face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents and intellectual property rights held by others we may be subject to lawsuits or required to stop developing or marketing the products or services obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the owners of the intellectual property or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the third party intellectual property we also could be required to pay damages if we were found to infringe intellectual property rights held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to intellectual property rights held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results see the discussion on the trademark infringement and breach of contract claims 

from cme in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report 

common stock 

we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders principal and interest on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock is dividends from our subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may fail to complete or realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our acquisitions which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we have completed many acquisitions including our recent acquisition of ellie mae and plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to integrate these businesses and realize anticipated cost savings revenue synergies and growth opportunities we generally set aggressive timelines for realizing savings which assumes we successfully undertake a variety of actions including but not limited to integrating technology eliminating redundancies and effecting organizational restructurings that are themselves subject to a variety of risks and may be subject to regulatory approvals that we do not control the process of integrating acquired companies is time consuming and could disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties including inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants regulators and others require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of the business 

there is also a risk that we may not integrate these acquired companies in a manner that permits our expected cost savings and revenue synergies to be fully realized in the time periods expected or at all in addition a variety of factors including but not limited to regulatory conditions governmental competition approvals cultural differences and difficulty integrating technology platforms may adversely affect our ability to complete our acquisitions or realize our anticipated cost savings and synergies 

we may also not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures or alliances that we have entered into or may enter into for a number of reasons including regulatory or government approvals or changes global market changes contractual obligations competing products and in some instances our lack of or limited control over the management of the business further strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future 

as a result of any future acquisition we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest expend cash incur debt assume actual and contingent liabilities inherit existing or pending litigation or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets further we cannot assure you that any such financing or equity investments will be available with terms that will be favorable to us or available at all 

provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ice 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for ice these provisions make a change of control less likely which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of us and european equity exchanges for example our organizational documents include provisions that generally restrict any person either alone or together with its related persons from i voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10 of our outstanding voting capital stock including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock or ii beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock further our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to call special stockholders’ meetings or act by written consent and generally authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock in addition provisions of delaware law may have a similar 

effect such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders as defined under delaware law from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the board of directors 

investment in and operation of bakkt 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our majority investment in bakkt and the investment may introduce additional risks to our business due to its evolving business model 

we have a majority ownership interest in bakkt bakkt intends to launch an integrated platform that enables users and partners to buy sell store convert and spend digital assets which include cryptocurrencies and other assets such as digital cash gift cards loyalty and rewards points and ingame assets bakkt also operates a custodial solution for bitcoin futures traded on ice futures us and other related trading products based on those futures due to our majority ownership interest in bakkt we have increased financial and reputational risks if there is a failure to launch one or more products or if the launch of a new product is unsuccessful also there can be no assurance that bakkt will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or support from partners and users to launch products as planned that bakkt will operate as anticipated or that we will realize the expected return on our investment we regularly evaluate our existing operations service capacity and business efficiencies and as a result of such evaluations we may undertake strategic initiatives outside of and within our businesses as a result it may take longer than expected for us to realize the expected returns from this investment or such returns may ultimately be less than anticipated furthermore our investment in bakkt entails numerous risks including risks relating to bakkt’s ability to 

• manage the complexity of its business model to stay current with the industry 

• successfully enter categories and markets in which it may have limited or no prior experience 

• apply distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets 

• successfully develop and integrate products systems or personnel into its business operations and 

• obtain and maintain required licenses and regulatory approvals for its business 

as digital assets and blockchain technologies evolve bakkt may add modify or discontinue certain aspects of its business model relating to the product mix and service offerings future additions and modifications to bakkt’s business will increase the complexity of its business and place significant strain on bakkt’s management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we cannot offer any assurance that these or any other additions or modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to bakkt’s business 

distributed ledger technology is relatively new and we believe that the application of distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets is novel bakkt has limited experience applying distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets the creation and operation of such technology in this application is subject to potential technical legal and regulatory constraints any problems that bakkt encounters with the operation of the bakkt systems including technical legal and regulatory problems could have a material adverse effect on its business and plan of operations 

hiring qualified and experienced personnel in this specialized technology space is difficult due to the high level of competition and scarcity of experience bakkt may have difficulty finding hiring and integrating qualified employees 

bakkts future revenue will be heavily dependent on transaction fees from payments trading and conversion and the spread from the buying and selling of bitcoin by users failure to grow the volume of payments trading and conversion or any subsequent products released by bakkt would negatively impact bakkts business financial condition and operating results and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

as described above on january 11 2021 bakkt entered into the merger agreement with vih the proposed transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including the approval of vih’s shareholders and certain regulatory approvals at the closing ice will enter into a voting agreement with the combined company and ice expects to reclassify the combined company as an equity method investment of ice and bakkt will therefore cease to be consolidated with ice’s financial statements the proposed transaction is currently pending and there is no assurance that all closing conditions will be satisfied or waived in the event the proposed transaction is not consummated the expected benefits of the proposed transaction including the contribution of additional capital to bakkt will not be realized and bakkt would not be deconsolidated from ice’s financial statements as described above 

the characteristics of digital assets have been and may in the future continue to be exploited to facilitate illegal activity such as fraud money laundering tax evasion and ransomware scams which could adversely affect us 

digital assets and the digital asset industry are relatively new and in many cases lightly regulated or largely unregulated some types of digital assets particularly cryptocurrencies have characteristics such as the speed with which transactions can be conducted the ability to conduct transactions without the involvement of regulated intermediaries the ability to engage in transactions across multiple jurisdictions the irreversible nature of certain transactions and encryption technology that anonymizes these transactions that make those assets particularly susceptible to use in illegal activity such as fraud money laundering tax evasion and ransomware scams 

while we believe that bakkt’s risk management and compliance framework is reasonably designed to detect any such illicit activities we cannot ensure that bakkt will be able to detect any such illegal activity in all instances because the speed irreversibility and anonymity of certain digital asset transactions make them more difficult to track fraudulent transactions may be more likely to occur bakkt may be specifically targeted by individuals seeking to conduct fraudulent transfers and it may be difficult or impossible for bakkt to detect and avoid such transactions in certain circumstances 

bakkt is subject to antimoney laundering counter terrorist financing laws and regulations and anticorruption laws globally and there can be no assurance that its employees or agents will not violate such laws and regulations  

bakkt is subject to antimoney laundering and counter terrorist financing laws and regulations globally including the usa patriot act as well as economic and trade sanctions programs including those imposed and administered by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control or ofac under ofac’s economic sanctions program bakkt is prohibited from financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies and with persons and entities included in ofacs sanctions lists including its list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons bakkt has implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that its employees or agents will not violate such laws and regulations a failure by bakkt or its employees or agents to comply with such laws and regulations and subsequent judgment or settlement against bakkt under these laws could subject bakkt to monetary penalties damages andor have a significant reputational impact 

bakkt is also subject to anticorruption laws and regulations globally including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act bakkt has implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that its employees or agents will not violate such laws and regulations a failure by bakkt or its employees or agents to comply with such laws and regulations and subsequent judgment or settlement against bakkt under these laws could subject bakkt to monetary penalties damages andor have a significant reputational impact 

regulatory changes or actions may restrict the use of digital assets in a manner that adversely affects bakkt’s business prospects or operations and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

as digital assets including cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size governments have reacted differently to such digital assets with certain governments deeming them illegal and others allowing their use and trade ongoing and future regulatory actions may impact the ability of bakkt to continue to operate and such actions could affect the ability of bakkt to continue as a going concern which would have a material adverse effect on the business prospects or operations of bakkt and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

the cftc has designated bitcoin as a commodity and as such exchangetraded derivatives involving bitcoin are subject to the cftcs jurisdiction and enforcement powers although the cftc has suggested it is not particularly focused on pursuing such enforcement at this time in the event that the cftc does pursue such enforcement and ultimately shuts down an exchange on which bakkt’s bitcoin futures contract is traded it may have a significant adverse impact on bakkts business and plan of operations and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

the regulatory framework is unsettled with respect to many forms of digital assets which means that federal or state regulators may in the future curtail or prohibit the acquisition use or redemption of certain digital assets ownership of holding or trading in certain digital assets may be subject to sanction federal or state regulators may also take regulatory action that may increase the cost andor subject companies to additional regulation that custody or facilitate the trading of digital assets 

in addition as bakkt expands its business to new products and services it will come under the jurisdiction of additional regulators  both with respect to jurisdiction inside and outside the us and subject matter payments consumer protection and other areas any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws regulations or orders of 

any governmental authority including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws regulations or orders including those discussed in this risk factor may subject bakkt to significant fines penalties criminal and civil lawsuits forfeiture of significant assets and enforcement result in additional compliance and licensure requirements increase regulatory scrutiny of its business restrict bakkt’s operations and force bakkt to change its business practices make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements bakkt has implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that its employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations 

digital asset custodial solutions and related technology including bakkt’s systems and custodial arrangements are subject to risks related to a loss of funds due to theft of digital assets employee or vendor sabotage security and cybersecurity risks system failures and other operational issues and a lack of sufficient insurance which could cause damage to bakkts reputation and brand 

bakkts systems and custodial solutions involve the processing storage and transmission of digital assets including cryptocurrencies and data while bakkt will contractually limit the amount of exposure it will have in the event that digital assets are stolen or misappropriated we cannot guarantee that these limits will protect bakkt from additional liability and other damage the theft or misappropriation of digital assets held in custody by bakkt would likely result in financial loss reputational damage potential lack of trust from our customers in other business lines negative press coverage and diversion of bakkt management’s time and focus the secure storage and transmission of digital assets and data over networks will be a critical element of bakkt’s operations despite the defensive measures bakkt may take these threats may come from external factors such as governments organized crime hackers and other third parties such as outsourced or infrastructuresupport providers and application developers or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom bakkt has granted access to its systems 

digital asset transactions may be irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred digital assets may be irretrievable once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain an incorrect transfer of a digital asset generally will not be reversible and bakkt may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft it is possible that through computer or human error or through theft or criminal action the digital asset could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties or to uncontrolled accounts such events would have a material adverse effect on the ability of bakkt to continue as a going concern which would have a material adverse effect on our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

while bakkt maintains insurance policies those policies may not be adequate to reimburse bakkt for losses caused by security breaches and bakkt may lose digital assets valued in excess of the insurance policy without any recourse unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions in the event of loss or loss of utility value there is no public insurer such as the securities investor protection corporation or the fdic to offer recourse to bakkt or to any investor and the misappropriated digital assets may not easily be traced to the bad actor 

further when cryptocurrency custodial solutions or transfer venues whether involving bakkt systems or others experience system failures or other operational issues such events could result in a reduction in cryptocurrency prices or confidence and impact the success of bakkt and have a material adverse effect on the ability of bakkt to continue as a going concern 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to bakkt’s reputation business and financial condition 

bakkts business involves the collection storage processing and transmission of confidential information and users personal data including financial information and information about how users interact with bakkt’s platform bakkt has built its reputation on the premise that bakkt offers its partners and users a secure and convenient way to manage their digital assets an increasing number of organizations including large merchants businesses technology companies and financial institutions as well as government institutions have disclosed breaches of their information security systems some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks including on their websites mobile applications and infrastructure 

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized improper or illegal access to systems and information including users personal data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated may be difficult to detect quickly and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target unauthorized parties have attempted and bakkt expects that they will continue to attempt to gain access to bakkt’s systems or facilities through various means including but not limited to hacking into bakkt’s systems or facilities or those of its users partners or vendors and attempting to fraudulently induce users of bakkts systems including employees and users into disclosing user names passwords payment card information or 

other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access bakkt’s information technology systems threats can come from a variety of sources including criminal hackers hacktivists statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage and insider threats certain efforts may be supported by significant financial and technological resources making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persisting cyberattacks cyberextortion spear phishing and social engineering schemes the introduction of computer viruses or other malware and the physical destruction of all or portions of bakkt’s information technology and infrastructure could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data in bakkts systems although bakkt has developed systems and processes designed to protect data it manages prevent data loss and other security breaches and effectively respond to known and potential risks and bakkt expects to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections there can be no assurance that these security measures will provide absolute security or prevent breaches or attacks 

bakkt’s information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches and third parties may be able to access bakkts users personal or proprietary information banking digital asset and payment card data or other sensitive data that are stored on or accessible through those systems bakkt has experienced from time to time and may experience in the future breaches of its security measures due to human error malfeasance insider threats system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities actual or perceived breaches of bakkts security could among other things 

• interrupt bakkt’s operations 

• result in bakkt’s systems or services being unavailable 

• result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and other laws 

• materially harm bakkt’s reputation and brand 

• result in significant regulatory scrutiny investigations fines penalties and other legal and financial exposure 

• cause bakkt to incur significant remediation costs 

• lead to loss of user confidence in or decreased use of bakkt’s products and services 

• divert the attention of management from the operation of bakkt’s business 

• result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from bakkt to bakkt’s customers and their business partners as a result of losses to them or claims by them and 

• adversely affect bakkt’s business and results of operations 

in addition any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting the information technology or infrastructure of companies bakkt acquires or of bakkt’s users partners or vendors including data center and cloud computing providers could have similar negative effects actual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches may lead to claims against bakkt 

in addition under payment card rules and its contracts with its card processors if there is a breach of payment card information that bakkt stores or that is stored by its direct payment card processing vendors bakkt could be liable to the payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees bakkt expects to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches financial services regulators in various jurisdictions including the us and the eu have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud which could impose significant costs require bakkt to change its business practices make it more difficult for new users to join bakkt and reduce the ease of use of bakkts products which could harm bakkts business while bakkt maintains insurance policies they may not be adequate to reimburse bakkt for losses caused by security breaches

business and industry 

global economic political and financial market events or conditions may negatively impact our business 

adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment government shutdowns currency fluctuations interest rate changes geopolitical events climate change international trade disputes including the imposition of tariffs or other protectionist measures actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade have in the past negatively impacted consumer and corporate confidence and resulted in reductions in consumer government and corporate spending and could have such effects in the future and in turn impact our business if our customers reduce spending workforce trading activity or demand for financial data as a result of challenges in the prevailing economic markets our revenues could decline 

a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from data services fees and fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets our market databased revenues are largely subscriptionbased or recurring and are generated from a range of global financial and commodity markets including pricing and reference data exchange data analytics feeds index services desktops and connectivity solutions for our transactionbased revenues we derive a significant percentage from trading in global energy and agriculturalrelated futures and options contracts as well as equity transactions and global interest rate contracts the market data subscriptions and trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of spending or trading activity for any reason including 

• adverse market conditions that curtail the addition of new customers or cause a decrease in purchases by our existing customers for our subscriptionbased products and services 

• weakness in the macroeconomic environment that causes our customers to delay or cancel existing orders or subscriptions 

• costcutting pressures across the industry or decrease in demand for our subscriptionbased products and services that lead to a reduction in price 

• consolidation in our markets or the markets of our customers that results in a reduction in the number of market participants 

• a reduction in trading demand by customers or a decision to curtail or cease hedging or speculative trading 

• regulatory or legislative changes impacting our business our customers and financial markets 

• political uncertainty and discord could negatively impact us if we are viewed as taking a political stance that is contrary to our customers beliefs or principles 

• the impact of climate change and the transition to renewable energy and away from crude oil 

• a prolonged decrease in volatility in the financial markets 

• heightened capital requirements or mandated reductions in leverage resulting from new regulations 

• defaults by clearing or exchange members or the inability of participants to pay out contractual obligations 

• changes to our contract specifications that are not viewed favorably by our market participants or 

• reduced access to or availability of capital required to fund trading activities 

a reduction in our overall trading volume could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenues a reduction in trading volumes could also result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for our market data which would further reduce our overall revenue 

further nyse’s revenue increases when more companies are seeking access to public markets and on the nyse specifically a stagnation or a decline in the initial public offering or ipo market or issuers choosing to list on venues other than the nyse could have an adverse effect on our revenues 

uschina trade and diplomatic tensions us government policies toward china including sanctions laws and regulations and chinese government policies toward us companies may impact our existing business and future opportunities as well as affect chinese companies’ ability to do business with us 

in addition adverse conditions in the residential mortgage lending industry including a substantial or prolonged decline in mortgage lending volume may have an adverse effect on our revenues mortgage lending volume has decreased substantially in certain years in the past and could again decrease in the future factors that could adversely impact mortgage lending volumes include increased mortgage interest rates reduced consumer and investor demand for mortgages more stringent underwriting guidelines decreased liquidity in the secondary mortgage market high levels of unemployment high levels of consumer debt lower consumer confidence changes in tax and other regulatory policies the number of existing mortgages eligible for refinancing the available inventory of housing affordability of housing and other macroeconomic factors 

owning clearing houses exposes us to risks including risks related to defaults by clearing members risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses 

there are risks inherent in operating clearing houses including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members market liquidity risks defaults by clearing members and risks associated with custody and investing margin or guaranty fund assets provided by clearing members to our clearing houses which could subject our business to substantial losses for example clearing members in ice clear europe have provided margin and guaranty funds with an aggregate cash balance of 381 billion as of december 31 2020 and a total of 841 billion for all of our clearing houses as of december 31 2020 in addition to the use of sovereign central bank access when applicable the ice clearing houses may use thirdparty investment advisors for investment of cash assets subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house and may add or change the investment managers from time to time to the extent available ice clear credit holds the us dollar cash and us treasuries that clearing members transfer to satisfy their original margin and guaranty fund requirements at its account at the federal reserve with respect to other clearing member cash posted ice clear credit currently selfmanages and uses external investment managers to invest such cash margin and guaranty fund deposits 

we have an obligation to return margin payments and guaranty fund contributions to clearing members to the extent that the relevant member’s risk based on its open contracts to the clearing house is reduced if a number of clearing members substantially reduce their open interest or default the concentration of risks within our clearing houses will be spread among a smaller pool of clearing members which would make it more difficult to absorb and manage risk in the event of a further clearing member’s default 

although our clearing houses have policies and procedures to help ensure that clearing members can satisfy their obligations such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a members or counterparty’s default in addition although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards it is a complex process and there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect us from the risks related to clearing these products we cannot assure you these measures and safeguards will be sufficient to protect us 

from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default we have contributed our own capital to the front of the guaranty fund of the clearing houses that could be used in the event of a default furthermore in 2019 we added a layer of insurance to our clearing member default protection the default insurance layer resides after and in addition to the ice clear credit ice clear europe and ice clear us ‘skin in the game’ contributions and before the guaranty fund contributions of the nondefaulting clearing members the default insurance has a threeyear term subject to renewal notwithstanding these actions the default of any one of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and cause our customers to lose confidence in the guaranty of our clearing houses 

a decline in the value of securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions by our clearing houses or default by a sovereign government issuer could pose additional risks of default by clearing members 

our clearing houses hold a substantial amount of assets as margin or guaranty fund contributions which comprise us and other sovereign treasury securities as of december 31 2020 our clearing houses held 673 billion of noncash margin or guaranty fund contributions in us and other sovereign treasury securities 507 billion of this amount was comprised of us treasury securities 26 billion of french treasury securities 22 billion of german treasury securities 24 billion of uk treasury securities and 94 billion of other european japanese and triparty treasury securities sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest and most liquid securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived credit worthiness of major governments however the markets for such securities have experienced significant volatility during the past decade due to ongoing financial challenges in some of the major european countries and the us government’s negotiations regarding taxation spending cuts and raising the debt ceiling which is the maximum amount of debt that the us government can legally incur in addition if there is a collapse in a specific currency relied upon by our clearing houses our clearing houses would face significant expenses in changing their systems and such an event could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates to mitigate this risk our clearing houses currently apply a discount or “haircut” to the market values for all sovereign securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions however market conditions could change more quickly than we adjust the amount of the haircuts and the haircuts could be insufficient in the event of a sudden market event 

if the value of these securities declines significantly our clearing houses will need to collect additional margin or guaranty fund contributions from their clearing members which may be difficult for the members to supply in a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government if a clearing member cannot supply the additional margin or guaranty fund contributions which may include cash in a currency acceptable to the clearing house the clearing house would deem the clearing member in default if any clearing members default as a result of the reduction in the value of margin or guaranty fund contributions our clearing houses and trading business could suffer substantial losses as a result of the loss of any capital that has been contributed to the clearing house’s guaranty funds and a loss of confidence by clearing members in the clearing house resulting in a reduction in volumes of future cleared transactions 

further our clearing houses invest large sums through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions in the event that a reverse repo counterparty defaults the value of the sovereign securities we hold as collateral might not be sufficient to cover our losses our clearing houses may also make demand deposits with banks that are secured only to the value of fdic insurance or other national deposit guarantee schemes which is small and therefore the deposits may in significant part be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent 

owning and operating cash equity and options exchanges exposes us to additional risks including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject 

owning and operating cash equity and options exchanges for which the revenues are primarily derived from trading activity market data and listing fees exposes us to additional risks adverse economic conditions and legal and regulatory changes similar to those discussed elsewhere in this section could result in decreased trading volume on our exchanges discourage or prohibit market participants from listing on our exchanges or cause them to forgo new offerings any of these could reduce our revenues including market data and listing fee revenue 

our cash equity and options exchanges also have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled for example these exchanges are responsible for enforcing listed company compliance with applicable listing standards enforcing our members compliance with exchange rules and federal securities laws complying with terms of nms plans filing of all material changes to exchanges rules with the sec and operating our exchanges consistent with exchange rules federal securities laws and other applicable laws any failure by one of our exchanges to comply with and enforce compliance by their members with exchange rules and securities laws could significantly harm our reputation prompt regulatory scrutiny 

result in the payment of fines or penalties and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our ability to do this could be impaired by for example recent sec amendments to nms plans for the consolidation of market data that impede the ability of the exchanges and finra to discharge their legal obligations by restricting the flow of information and constraining the decisionmaking authority of the exchanges and finra 

we must allocate significant resources to fulfill our regulatory and selfregulatory responsibilities the forprofit exchanges’ goal of maximizing stockholder value might contradict the exchanges’ regulatory and selfregulatory responsibilities in addition the listing of our common stock on the nyse could potentially create a conflict between the exchange’s regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities on the one hand and our commercial and economic interest on the other hand while we have structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful 

further changes in the rules of our securities markets must be reviewed and approved by the sec approval of such changes by the sec cannot be guaranteed and the sec could delay either the approval process or the initiation of the public comment process any denial or delay in approving changes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding regulatory changes impacting our cash equities and options exchanges including risks to our business associated with possible regulation of services offered by nonexchange affiliates and us listing and trading prohibitions on certain foreign companies 

our business is subject to the impact of financial markets volatility including the prices and interest rates underlying our derivative products or which impact mortgage origination volumes due to conditions that are beyond our control 

trading volume in our markets and products is largely driven by the degree of volatility  the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations  in prices and levels of the underlying commodities securities indices financial benchmarks or other instruments volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates opportunities for investment and speculative or arbitrage trading were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices or levels of the underlying commodities securities indices benchmarks or other instruments of our products we could experience lower trading volumes slower growth or declines in revenues 

factors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility and thus trading volumes include 

• global economic political and market conditions 

• concerns over inflation deflation legislative and regulatory changes government fiscal and monetary policy  including actions by the federal reserve and other foreign monetary units governing bodies and investor and consumer confidence levels 

• weather conditions including hurricanes and other significant events natural and unnatural disasters like large oil spills that impact the production of commodities and in the case of energy commodities production refining and distribution facilities for oil and natural gas 

• war acts of terrorism and any unforeseen market closures or disruptions in trading 

• political developments impacting international trade including continued uncertainty surrounding the implementation of brexit trade disputes and increased tariffs particularly between the us and china and imposition of protectionist measures 

• real and perceived changes in the supply and demand of commodities underlying our products particularly energy and agricultural products including changes as a result of technological improvements or the development of alternative energy sources and 

• credit quality of market participants the availability of capital and the levels of assets under management 

any one or more of these factors which are beyond our control may reduce trading activity which could make our markets less attractive as a source of liquidity and in turn could further discourage existing and potential market participants and thus accelerate a decline in the level of trading activity and potentially related services such as data or clearing further lower market volatility could also result in more exchanges competing for trading volumes to maintain their growth if any of these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets could be jeopardized because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our current products and services 

decline for any reason we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues which would cause our net income to decline 

systems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry could negatively impact us 

highprofile system failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our business and result in a loss of confidence in our technology and our markets regulatory investigations fines and penalties and business activity slowdown or interruptions further regulators have imposed requirements for trading platforms that have been costly for us to implement and could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services in particular the sec’s regulation systems compliance and integrity or regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations subject portions of our securities and derivatives trading platforms and other technological systems related to our clearing houses trade repositories and the us swap execution facility or sef to extensive regulation and oversight ensuring our compliance with the requirements of regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations requires significant ongoing administrative and compliance expenses and burdens in addition the sec’s expansion of the ice systems that are determined to be in scope for regulation sci could result in significant additional expenditures 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism including cyberterrorism than other companies 

given our prominence in the global securities industry and the location of many of our properties and personnel in us and european financial centers including lower manhattan we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees in addition terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets including trading on exchanges any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results 

since we conduct operations in several different countries including the us uk and canada as well as the eu substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling canadian dollars and euros because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies could affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

external events such as brexit and the negotiations regarding the terms thereof and the passage of us taxation reform legislation have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially among the us dollar the british pound sterling and the euro if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the uk eu the us or other key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further the value of the pound sterling and euro and the global credit markets may further weaken general financial instability in countries in the eu could have a contagion effect on the region and contribute to the general instability and uncertainty in the eu events that adversely affect our uk and eu clients and suppliers could in turn have a materially adverse effect on our international business results and our operating results 

for additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk refer to “ foreign currency exchange rate risk” in item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk which is included in this annual report 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we have achieved significant growth since becoming a public company in 2005 our growth is highly dependent on customer demand for our core products and services favorable economic conditions and our ability to invest in our personnel facilities infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls adverse economic conditions 

could reduce customer demand for our products and services which may place a significant strain on our management and resources and could force us to defer existing or future planned opportunities we regularly evaluate our existing operations service capacity and business efficiencies and as a result of such evaluations we may undertake strategic initiatives outside of and within our businesses we may not be successful in executing on our strategies to support our growth organically or through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances 

we may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities 

we from time to time launch and intend in the future to launch new products services and business ventures and continue to explore and pursue other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we have spent and may continue to spend substantial time and money developing new product or service offerings or improving current product or service offerings including for example our mortgage technology services if these offerings are not successful we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to recover the costs of such initiatives obtaining any required regulatory approval associated with these offerings may also result in delays or restrictions on our ability to benefit fully from these offerings further we have entered into and may seek in the future to enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry among other advantages introducing or maintaining our offerings in certain countries is also subject to a number of other risks including currency exchange rate risk difficulties enforcing agreements or collecting receivables longer payment cycles compliance with the laws or regulations of these countries and political and regulatory uncertainties 

in addition in light of consolidation in the exchange data services clearing and mortgage technology sectors and competition for opportunities we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully our competitors could merge making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors also offering new products and services and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives that are necessary for our success 

the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions globally and has led governmental authorities to take unprecedented measures to mitigate the spread of the disease including travel bans border closings business closures quarantines and shelterinplace orders and to take actions designed to stabilize markets and promote economic growth 

from an operational perspective the spread of covid19 has resulted in and could continue to result in temporary closures of our office facilities and the office facilities of our customers and our thirdparty vendors we have taken preventive measures and implemented contingency plans and currently most of our employees are working remotely however we cannot assure you that such measures will adequately protect our business and an extended period of remote work arrangements could heighten existing and introduce new operational risks including but not limited to cybersecurity risk and could strain our technological resources and business continuity plans if one or more of the thirdparty vendors to whom we outsource certain material activities claim that they cannot perform due to a force majeure or experience operational failures as a result of the covid19 pandemic it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition further although we maintain contingency plans for events such as pandemic outbreaks the further spread of covid19 could impact the availability of our executive officers and other key employees who are necessary to conduct our business 

the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend largely on future developments including among other things the widespread distribution acceptance and effectiveness of a vaccine which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time delays in the widespread distribution of a vaccine or lack of public acceptance of a vaccine could have an adverse effect on the global economy further even if a vaccine is widely distributed and accepted there can be no assurance that the vaccine will ultimately be successful in limiting or stopping the spread of covid19 a prolonged economic downturn could have an adverse effect on our revenues related to certain activities such as a decline in demand for certain data products and a decline in ipos the covid19 pandemic could also have an adverse impact on our customers’ businesses risk management needs and ability to trade and the resulting impact on our business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

while governmental organizations are engaging in efforts to combat the spread and severity of covid19 these measures may not be effective moreover actions taken by us or other governmental authorities that are intended to 

ameliorate the macroeconomic or other effects of covid19 or delays in the announcement or implementation of regulatory measures that had been pending prior to the covid19 pandemic have resulted in and may in the future result in regulatory uncertainty and could in turn impact our business at this time we cannot predict how legal and regulatory responses to concerns about covid19 will impact our business 

in addition to the extent that covid19 may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations it may also heighten other risks described in this section 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill other intangible assets or investments 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2020 we had goodwill of 213 billion and net other intangible assets of 144 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties 

during 2020 we did not record any impairments of our goodwill intangible assets or investments we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may result in these types of impairments an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill other intangible assets and other investments and assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 

for additional information on our goodwill other intangible assets and investments refer to notes 3 4 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements and “ critical accounting policies  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets” in item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which are included in this annual report 

legal and regulatory 

our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to extensive legislation and regulatory scrutiny and we face the risk of changes to our regulatory environment and business in the future 

we are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in many jurisdictions around the world and in particular in the us and the uk we face the risk of significant actions by regulatory and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments which may affect our business the activity of our market participants and our results among other things as a result of regulators and tax authorities enforcing existing laws and regulations we could be censured fined prohibited from pursuing certain acquisitions or engaging in some of our business activities subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities including fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory pricing restrictions also known as frand or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees including settlement payments interest payments and penalty payments in many cases our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions 

there is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could be imposed this could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients’ overall trading volume through our exchanges and demand for our market data mortgage technology and other services 

we are also subject to regulatory risks relating to the mortgage industry which is heavily regulated in the us changes to existing laws or regulations or adoption of new laws or regulations that affect the residential mortgage industry could reduce residential mortgage volume or otherwise limit the ability of users and participants of our mortgage technology services to operate their businesses resulting in decreased usage of our solutions alternatively reduced regulatory requirements could also reduce the demand for certain of our products and services which are intended to enable our customers to satisfy existing regulatory requirements in addition potential structural changes in the us residential mortgage industry in particular plans to diminish the role of fannie mae and freddie mac could disrupt the residential mortgage market and have a material adverse effect on our business 

there is also increasing public concern regarding data privacy and data protection and many jurisdictions have passed laws in this area such as the european union general data protection regulation the uk general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions the laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection are increasing in complexity and number 

change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us regulation of privacy and data protection often times require monitoring of and changes to our data practices in regard to the collection use disclosure storage transfer andor security of personal and sensitive information including the personal information of the customers of the users of the software and services provided by our ice mortgage technology business 

these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our stockholders and creditors 

us uk and eu legal and regulatory developments in particular emir emir 22 mifid ii and the bmr including each such regulation as incorporated into uk law and the doddfrank act have significantly altered and propose to further alter the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability these regulatory developments could also cause us to change our business practices restructure our businesses or move certain of our businesses and employees the enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes most likely to affect our businesses are nondiscriminatory access provisions of mifid ii interoperability and margin rules in emir enhanced regulatory capital liquidity and leverage rules in basel iii and capital requirements directive iv access rules under the bmr the nonharmonization of margin requirements implementation of a financial transaction tax access to our benchmarks and maintaining our exchanges’ abilities to operate as sros with related immunity for the discharge of their regulatory functions as the operator of global businesses the lack of harmonization in international financial reform efforts could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in multiple jurisdictions 

the doddfrank act established enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the fsoc ice clear credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the fsoc and as a result is subject to additional oversight by the cftc compliance with these requirements has resulted in and will continue to result in additional operating costs 

in 2016 the sec approved a plan to establish a marketwide consolidated audit trail or cat to improve regulators’ ability to monitor trading activity in 2018 the first phase of implementation went live and required sro participants to begin reporting to the cat in addition to increased risk in connection with our regulatory obligations implementation of the cat could result in significant additional expenditures which may not be reimbursed funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the sros and brokerdealers to date however funding has been provided solely by the sros partly in exchange for promissory notes which increases the risk that sros including us will not be reimbursed for costs expended to date due to delays and failures in implementation and functionality by the original plan processor we recorded promissory note impairment charges of 2 million and 16 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively we believe the risk that sros are not reimbursed has increased resulting in this impairment until the sec approves a funding model that shares the cost of the cat between the sros and brokerdealers the sros may continue to incur additional costs which may become significant and may not be reimbursed as of december 31 2020 we have accrued approximately 22 million as a receivable in connection with our portion of expenses related to the cat implementation 

we are subject to tax laws regulations rulings and audits in multiple us and nonus jurisdictions that could have a significant impact on our business and lead to additional expenditures for us or our customers for example there have been discussions in various jurisdictions around financial transaction or digital service tax frameworks changes to tax frameworks in jurisdictions where we operate significant business for example in new jersey new york the eu or federally in the us has the potential to increase costs to us or to our market participants and discourage participation in the markets we operate furthermore implementation of any new or amended tax laws or regulations could impact our global operations or trading volumes 

other enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations 

our compliance and risk management methods as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations might not be effective which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators 

our ability to comply with existing rules regulations and laws and changing rules regulations and laws largely depends on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel regulators periodically review our ability to selfregulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including selfregulatory standards certain of our businesses associated with the nyse are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations policies and procedures if we fail to comply with any of these obligations regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business 

our acquisitions expose us to new regulatory requirements for example as a result of our acquisition of interactive data we operate an secregistered investment adviser investment advisers are subject to significant regulatory obligations under the investment advisers act prior to this acquisition none of our businesses were registered under the investment advisers act compliance with the investment advisers act and other regulatory requirements gives rise to costs and expenses that may be material in addition our acquisition of the bondpoint ats in january 2018 and our acquisition of tmc bonds in july 2018 exposes us to increased exposure to regulatory scrutiny from the sec finra and msrb our acquisition of ellie mae in 2020 exposes us to increased exposure to regulatory scrutiny from us regulatory bodies which regulate the us residential mortgage industry including the ffiec and its member agencies including among others the cfpb 

our regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders embargo future business activity or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses we have settled certain regulatory actions in the past including ice data pricing  reference data llc’s settlement with the sec in november 2020 in which we agreed to pay an 8 million civil monetary penalty we continue to face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity of our business any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our financial condition operating results or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined to be in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business further any settlement consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or regulatory agencies begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities finally the implementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to remain competitive and grow our business 

regulatory changes or court rulings may have an adverse impact on our ability to derive revenue from market data and connectivity fees 

regulatory developments or court rulings could reduce the amount of revenue that we obtain from exchange market data and connectivity fees related to our us equity and options exchanges with respect to our us equities and equity options exchanges our ability to assess fees for market data products and certain connectivity fees are subject to review by the sec there continues to be opposing industry viewpoints and litigation as to the extent that our us equities and equity options exchanges should be able to charge for market data and market access and the manner in which we set such exchange fees could be reassessed 

if new constraints are placed on our ability to charge for market data or market access in the us it could have a negative impact on our revenues we cannot predict whether or in what form any regulatory or other changes will take effect or their impact on our business a determination by the sec or a court for example that the sec must link market data fees to marginal costs take a more active role in the market data ratesetting process or reduce the current levels of market data fees could have an adverse effect on our market data revenues 

separately our european exchanges are currently authorized to sell trade information on a nondiscriminatory basis at a reasonable cost this regulatory position could be modified or interpreted by the ec or future european court decisions in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our european market data revenues 

in addition the fca and iosco have both issued consultations to explore access to market data in financial markets the results of these consultations may lead to a regulatory response that could affect our business similar to the us if new constraints are placed on our ability to charge for market data or market access in the uk or other jurisdictions it could have a negative impact on our revenues 

the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the uks exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

in 2016 voters in the uk approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit brexit has created political and economic uncertainty and instability in the global markets including currency and credit markets particularly in the uk and eu in addition political and economic uncertainty surrounding the future relationship of the uk and eu could lead to certain macroeconomic conditions that adversely affect our business adverse macroeconomic consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates legal uncertainty potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or enactment of replicate andor prohibitive laws and regulations that may adversely affect both demand for our products and services and our ability to deliver our products and services into the eu the longterm effects of brexit will depend in part on the agreement the uk made to retain access to eu markets 

following the formation of a majority conservative government in december 2019 the uk withdrew from the eu on january 31 2020 and completed its withdrawal on january 1 2021 prior to completing its withdrawal in december 2020 the uk and eu agreed to a trade and cooperation agreement which was provisionally applied as of january 1 2021 this agreement governs the euuk relationship after the completion of the uk’s exit from the eu the ukeu brexit deal does not provide a transition period for financial services or any new arrangements to replace the existing “passport” this leaves both the uk and eu to address matters of access in financial services through declarations of equivalence under existing equivalence regimes contained in uk and eu law and through domestic laws the ec has however adopted an 18month temporary equivalence decision for uk ccps which applies beginning on january 1 2021 ice clear europe has been recognized by esma as a thirdcountry ccp in accordance with emir 

as a result of the trade and cooperation agreement not providing free trade arrangements for financial services any equivalence determinations or any further transition period for financial services could include restrictions on access to our services by persons located in the eu or make access more expensive which could adversely affect our operations and profitability or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions the consequences of brexit and the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement could also cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding brexit including risks to our business associated with brexit 

risks relating to the administration of benchmarks and indices including libor and the potential for changes to cessations of and the replacement of or transition from benchmarks and indices including libor may result in legal risks and could adversely affect our business 

certain of our subsidiaries produce and license multiple global benchmarks and indices across asset classes which are referenced in certain of our trading and clearing products to ensure continued trading and clearing in these benchmarkrelated products and the continued licensing and use of these benchmarks and indices our subsidiaries must be able to demonstrate that these benchmarks and indices are administered with integrity and are not readily subject to manipulation and must also continue to evolve these benchmarks and indices as necessary to maintain their reliability and relevance as an example our subsidiary iba is the administrator of various global benchmarks including libor iba assumed the administration of libor following various cases of attempted manipulation and misconduct related to the libor benchmark that emerged following the financial crisis any failures negative publicity or lawsuits related to our subsidiaries administration of benchmarks and indices including libor could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and indices and could harm our business and our reputation 

changes to cessations of and the replacement of or transition from our subsidiaries benchmarks and indices including libor or any other changes or reforms to the determination or administration of such benchmarks and indices could result in legal risks risks to our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results in july 2017 the fca stated its intention that it would no longer be necessary to sustain libor through its influence or legal powers beyond 2021 the fca and global regulators have since advocated for a transition from libor to alternative rates by the end of 2021 on december 4 2020 iba published a consultation on its intention to cease the publication of i all gbp eur chf and jpy libor settings and the 1 week and 2 month usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on december 31 2021 and ii the overnight and 1 3 6 and 12 month usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on june 30 2023 subject to any rights of the fca to compel iba to continue publication the consultation closed on january 25 2021 and iba intends to share the results of the consultation with the fca and to publish a feedback statement summarizing responses from the consultation 

in october 2020 the uk government introduced the financial services bill which includes proposed uk legislation to ensure that the fca has appropriate regulatory powers to manage and direct any winddown period prior to eventual libor cessation the new proposed powers would allow the fca to compel iba to publish critical benchmarks such as libor under a new methodology that is no longer representative of the underlying market that the benchmark currently measures and also to restrict the use of critical benchmarks such as libor subject to such changes or in respect of which the administrator has confirmed its intention to cease the benchmark 

we continue to monitor industry and regulatory developments but it is not yet possible to predict with certainty how the transition from and any potential cessations of libor will proceed and how the proposed new powers of the fca will be implemented and what effect the transition from and any potential exercise of new fca powers in relation to libor may have on the markets that use the benchmark today 

we may face liability for content contained in our data products and services 

we have been and may in the future be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation libel copyright or trademark infringement fraud or negligence or based on other theories of liability in each case relating to the data articles commentary ratings information or other content we distribute in our financial data services if such data or other content or information that we distribute has errors is delayed or has design defects we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our corporate website or those websites that we own and operate through links to other websites use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for significant amounts any such claim even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us could involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and a negative impact on our reputation 

in addition we license and redistribute data and content from various third parties and the terms of these licenses change frequently our thirdparty data and content suppliers may audit our use of and our clients’ use of and payment for data and content from time to time in the ordinary course of business including audits currently underway such thirdparty data and content suppliers have asserted and may in the future assert that we or our clients owe additional amounts under the terms of the applicable license agreements that we inappropriately distributed the thirdparty data or that we or our clients used the data or content in a manner that exceeded the scope of the applicable license agreement or without a license agreement see the discussion on the trademark infringement and breach of contract claims from cme group inc or cme under the caption span trademark dispute in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report we have and expect to continue to spend and allocate resources to develop and acquire the use of technology and other intellectual property rights to manage these risks and track thirdparty data usage but we cannot be assured that we will not incur liability we may incur costs to investigate any allegations and may be required to pay damages to or make unexpected settlement payments to these data and content suppliers and these costs and payments could be material 

we are subject to significant litigation and liability risks 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our participants involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred for example dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platforms or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades abusive trading practices security and confidentiality breaches mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants in addition because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by entering them inaccurately a large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets 

in addition we are subject to ongoing legal disputes that could result in the payment of fines penalties or damages and could expose us to additional liability in the future see item 3 legal proceedings in this annual report for a general description of our legal proceedings and claims and note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for a summary of specific legal proceedings under the captions city of providence litigation libor litigation ice data pricing  reference data matter and span trademark dispute while ice intends to vigorously defend these specific matters the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be determined and adverse rulings in these matters could impact our financial condition and continued operations 

further we could incur significant expenses defending the claims mentioned above and any future claims even those without merit which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us including those we are involved with due to acquisition activity may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we may have to establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change 

operational and liquidity 

our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cyberattacks hacking and other cybersecurity risks which could result in wrongful manipulation disclosure destruction or use of our information or that of a third party or which could make our participants unable or reluctant to use our electronic platforms 

the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to reliably transact on our electronic platforms and provide financial data services are critical elements of our operations some of our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential client and other data including client portfolio information if anyone gains improper access to our electronic platforms networks or databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify our confidential information or that of a third party breaches of our cybersecurity measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business our networks and those of our participants thirdparty service providers and external market infrastructures may be vulnerable to compromise unauthorized access security technology failure computer viruses social engineering denial of service attacks terrorism ransomware attacks firewall or encryption failures or other security problems resulting in loss of data integrity information disclosure unavailability or fraud the financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of political protest activism and financial gain and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for cyberattack and other information security threats further former employees of companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly 

although we have not been subject to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity events including distributed denial of service or ddos attacks malware infections phishing web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size for example we experienced ddos attempts brand misuse social media impersonation and phishing attempts directed toward employee systems and personal email accounts during 2020 while we operate an information security program that is designed to prevent detect track and mitigate cyber incidents and that has detected and mitigated such incidents in the past we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against future attacks any such attacks could result in reputational damage cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose customers cause us to experience lower current and future trading volumes or incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive position in addition given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or disable or degrade systems a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected and we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely the extent of a particular cyber incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while such an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it which may compound damages before the incident is discovered or remediated additionally as threats continue to evolve and increase and as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities which could adversely impact our net income 

following the acquisition of ellie mae whose systems process and host millions of us residential mortgages each year resulting in a larger attack surface our exposure to personally identifiable information or pii has increased failure to maintain the security of the confidential information of the customers of the users of our software and services could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and operating results 

further cybersecurity threats to and incidents involving vendors and other thirdparties who support our activities  particularly those with lesssophisticated defenses  could impact us for example although we did not experience any material impacts from the solarwinds orion cybersecurity breach that was widely publicized in december 2020 we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may be material 

our business may be harmed by computer and communication systems failures and delays 

our business depends on the integrity reliability and security of our infrastructure which is highly dependent on our computer and communication systems our customers rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate and highquality financial market data analytics and related solutions our timely reliable delivery of highquality products and services is dependent upon an array of technical production processes that enable our content delivery platforms our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans including our ability to recover from the loss of one of our primary data centers may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach our systems or those of our thirdparty providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

• unanticipated disruption in service to our participants 

• slower response time and delays in our participants’ trade execution and processing 

• failed settlement by participants to whom we provide trade confirmation or clearing services 

• incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades 

• failure to complete the clearing house margin settlement process resulting in significant financial risk 

• distribution of inaccurate or untimely market data to participants who rely on this data in their trading activity 

• disruption to ice mortgage technology and loan origination systems and 

• financial loss to us or those who depend on our systems and data 

we have experienced system failures in the past due to telecommunication failures and hardware and software malfunctions and defects and could experience future system failures due to power or telecommunications failures human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyberattacks intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar events these situations could result in damage to our business reputation and participant dissatisfaction with our electronic platform which could prompt participants to trade elsewhere or expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions as a consequence our business financial condition and operating results could suffer materially 

our regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses could be adversely affected 

an interruption or cessation of an important service data or content supplied by any third party or the loss of an exclusive license could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as online service providers hosting service and software providers data processors data centers software and hardware vendors banks local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading clearing data services mortgage technology applications and other systems we rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with third parties and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for the provision of hosting services we also depend on thirdparty suppliers for data and content including data received from certain competitors clients various government and public record services and financial institutions used in our products and services some of this data is exclusive to particular suppliers and may not be obtained from other suppliers in addition our data suppliers could enter into exclusive contracts with our competitors without our knowledge the general trend toward industry consolidation may increase the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future if these companies were to experience difficulties discontinue providing services to us for any reason or be unable to or fail to provide the type of service agreed to for any reason we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines or damage to our reputation it could require a significant amount of time to 

transition to new thirdparty service providers our thirdparty data suppliers perform audits on us from time to time in the ordinary course of business to determine if data we license for redistribution has been properly accounted for in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreement as a result of these audits we may incur additional expenses 

many of our clients also rely on third parties to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform if these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients’ inability to transact with our businesses we hold exclusive licenses to list various index futures and contracts in the future litigation or regulatory action may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and contracts trading to a single exchange and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license mifid ii introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of services relating to commodity derivatives across europe and the legislation requires open access to any benchmarks a benchmark is an index or other measure used to determine the value of a financial instrument for example libor or the sp 500 used in europe if unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive license were permitted we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products 

our success largely depends on key personnel including our senior management and having adequate succession plans in place we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business which could harm our business 

our future performance depends in large part on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel including our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel competition for key personnel in the various localities and business segments in which we operate is intense our ability to attract and retain key personnel in particular senior management will be dependent on a number of factors including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent there is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who we rely upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives the loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel could harm our business in particular we may have to incur costs to replace senior officers or other key employees who leave and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner 

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and restrict our activities or satisfy our debt service obligations 

as of december 31 2020 we had 165 billion of outstanding debt this level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt service obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our peers and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities as we use our available resources to reduce and refinance our consolidated debt our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue future business opportunities may be further restrained in addition the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio test and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other matters further a portion of our outstanding debt has historically been and continues to be in commercial paper which is subject to interest rate changes rising interest rates will result in an increase in our interest expense we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could materially affect our financial condition 

our longterm and shortterm debt is currently rated by moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s these ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time and it is possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade our credit ratings in the future in particular our inability to sustain reduced debt on a consolidated basis may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings following our acquisition of ellie mae and our associated borrowings moodys investor services and standard  poors reevaluated our credit ratings and lowered our ratings along with standard  poors placing us on negative outlook 

although these actions have not resulted in a material impact on our business or a material increase in borrowing costs a significant downgrade of our credit ratings in the future could impact customers’ willingness to use our clearing houses make parties less willing to do business with us and could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase the cost of our commercial paper and any future debt funding we may obtain 

competition 

we face intense competition failure to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences could negatively impact our competitive position 

we face intense competition in all aspects of our business and our competitors both domestic and international are numerous we currently compete with 

• regulated diversified futures exchanges globally that offer trading in a variety of asset classes similar to those offered by us such as energy agriculture equity and equity index credit and interest rate derivatives markets and foreign exchange 

• exchanges offering listing and trading of cash equities etfs closedend funds and other structured products similar to those offered by us 

• market data and information vendors 

• providers of digital solutions including providers of mortgage origination compliance pricing and documentation services 

• interdealer brokers active in the global credit derivatives markets 

• existing and newly formed electronic trading platforms service providers and other exchanges 

• other clearing houses and 

• consortiums of our customers members or market participants that may work together to achieve more favorable terms or pool their trading activity to establish new exchanges trading platforms or clearing facilities 

trends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings finally many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and ats businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business some of our competitors may have greater capital and resources offer a wide range of products and services or operate under less stringent regulatory regimes than we do 

in the mortgage technology sector we compete against other software providers as well as companies that offer “point of sale” or webbased online loan applications services we also compete with traditional methods of exchanging data and documents among mortgage industry participants such as email facsimile phone courier and mail mortgage originators may also manually upload loan data or enter information into each investor’s lender’s or service provider’s website in lieu of using our solutions there is vigorous competition among providers of mortgage technology services and we may be unsuccessful in differentiating our services to the extent necessary to effectively compete and may not succeed in convincing potential customers using other services or methods to switch to ours 

we also face pricing competition in many areas of our business a decline in our fees due to competitive pressure or regulatory changes the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for example our data service offerings have benefited from a high renewal rate in its subscriptionbased services but we cannot assure you that this will continue we also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings modify the pricing for our products or retain our current customers or attract new customers if we are not able to compete successfully our business could be materially impacted including our ability to remain as an operating entity 

our success depends on our ability to maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our technology to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary and acquired technology the financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change change in use patterns change in client preferences frequent product and service introductions and the emergence of new industry standards and practices these changes could render our 

existing proprietary technology uncompetitive or obsolete we have implemented a new trading technology system at nyse and if there are trading disruptions or if the new system has inadequate performance we could suffer material losses incur reputational damage or be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology to our clients’ requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and costeffective manner any failure to remain abreast of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to client preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our results 

damage to our reputation could damage our business 

our business is highly competitive and our customers typically have options on where to conduct their business our management team and business operations benefit from being highly regarded in our industry maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and for maintaining our relationships with our regulators negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services operations risk management compliance with regulations political affiliations or management team could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our existing business and business prospects 

intellectual property 

our use of open source software could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services and subject us to litigation 

we use some opensource software in our technology most often as small components within a larger product or service to augment algorithms functionalities or libraries we create and we may use more opensource software in the future opensource code is also contained in some thirdparty software we rely on we could be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of the license for such opensource software the terms of many opensource licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us or other courts and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services further opensource licensors generally do not provide technology support maintenance warranties or assurance of title or controls on the origin of the software which can also lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties including trademarks service marks trade names trade secrets copyrights and patents we cannot assure you that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property additionally we may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively further we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights which may require significant financial and managerial resources as a result we may choose not to enforce our infringed intellectual property rights depending on our strategic evaluation and judgment regarding the best use of our resources the relative strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the recourse available to us 

in addition our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may have obtained and may be expected to obtain in the future patent and intellectual property rights related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents and intellectual property rights that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services as a result we may face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents and intellectual property rights held by others we may be subject to lawsuits or required to stop developing or marketing the products or services obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the owners of the intellectual property or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the third party intellectual property we also could be required to pay damages if we were found to infringe intellectual property rights held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to intellectual property rights held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results see the discussion on the trademark infringement and breach of contract claims 

from cme in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report 

common stock 

we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders principal and interest on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock is dividends from our subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may fail to complete or realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our acquisitions which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we have completed many acquisitions including our recent acquisition of ellie mae and plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to integrate these businesses and realize anticipated cost savings revenue synergies and growth opportunities we generally set aggressive timelines for realizing savings which assumes we successfully undertake a variety of actions including but not limited to integrating technology eliminating redundancies and effecting organizational restructurings that are themselves subject to a variety of risks and may be subject to regulatory approvals that we do not control the process of integrating acquired companies is time consuming and could disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties including inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants regulators and others require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of the business 

there is also a risk that we may not integrate these acquired companies in a manner that permits our expected cost savings and revenue synergies to be fully realized in the time periods expected or at all in addition a variety of factors including but not limited to regulatory conditions governmental competition approvals cultural differences and difficulty integrating technology platforms may adversely affect our ability to complete our acquisitions or realize our anticipated cost savings and synergies 

we may also not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures or alliances that we have entered into or may enter into for a number of reasons including regulatory or government approvals or changes global market changes contractual obligations competing products and in some instances our lack of or limited control over the management of the business further strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future 

as a result of any future acquisition we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest expend cash incur debt assume actual and contingent liabilities inherit existing or pending litigation or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets further we cannot assure you that any such financing or equity investments will be available with terms that will be favorable to us or available at all 

provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ice 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for ice these provisions make a change of control less likely which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of us and european equity exchanges for example our organizational documents include provisions that generally restrict any person either alone or together with its related persons from i voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10 of our outstanding voting capital stock including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock or ii beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock further our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to call special stockholders’ meetings or act by written consent and generally authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock in addition provisions of delaware law may have a similar 

effect such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders as defined under delaware law from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the board of directors 

investment in and operation of bakkt 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our majority investment in bakkt and the investment may introduce additional risks to our business due to its evolving business model 

we have a majority ownership interest in bakkt bakkt intends to launch an integrated platform that enables users and partners to buy sell store convert and spend digital assets which include cryptocurrencies and other assets such as digital cash gift cards loyalty and rewards points and ingame assets bakkt also operates a custodial solution for bitcoin futures traded on ice futures us and other related trading products based on those futures due to our majority ownership interest in bakkt we have increased financial and reputational risks if there is a failure to launch one or more products or if the launch of a new product is unsuccessful also there can be no assurance that bakkt will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or support from partners and users to launch products as planned that bakkt will operate as anticipated or that we will realize the expected return on our investment we regularly evaluate our existing operations service capacity and business efficiencies and as a result of such evaluations we may undertake strategic initiatives outside of and within our businesses as a result it may take longer than expected for us to realize the expected returns from this investment or such returns may ultimately be less than anticipated furthermore our investment in bakkt entails numerous risks including risks relating to bakkt’s ability to 

• manage the complexity of its business model to stay current with the industry 

• successfully enter categories and markets in which it may have limited or no prior experience 

• apply distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets 

• successfully develop and integrate products systems or personnel into its business operations and 

• obtain and maintain required licenses and regulatory approvals for its business 

as digital assets and blockchain technologies evolve bakkt may add modify or discontinue certain aspects of its business model relating to the product mix and service offerings future additions and modifications to bakkt’s business will increase the complexity of its business and place significant strain on bakkt’s management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we cannot offer any assurance that these or any other additions or modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to bakkt’s business 

distributed ledger technology is relatively new and we believe that the application of distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets is novel bakkt has limited experience applying distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets the creation and operation of such technology in this application is subject to potential technical legal and regulatory constraints any problems that bakkt encounters with the operation of the bakkt systems including technical legal and regulatory problems could have a material adverse effect on its business and plan of operations 

hiring qualified and experienced personnel in this specialized technology space is difficult due to the high level of competition and scarcity of experience bakkt may have difficulty finding hiring and integrating qualified employees 

bakkts future revenue will be heavily dependent on transaction fees from payments trading and conversion and the spread from the buying and selling of bitcoin by users failure to grow the volume of payments trading and conversion or any subsequent products released by bakkt would negatively impact bakkts business financial condition and operating results and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

as described above on january 11 2021 bakkt entered into the merger agreement with vih the proposed transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including the approval of vih’s shareholders and certain regulatory approvals at the closing ice will enter into a voting agreement with the combined company and ice expects to reclassify the combined company as an equity method investment of ice and bakkt will therefore cease to be consolidated with ice’s financial statements the proposed transaction is currently pending and there is no assurance that all closing conditions will be satisfied or waived in the event the proposed transaction is not consummated the expected benefits of the proposed transaction including the contribution of additional capital to bakkt will not be realized and bakkt would not be deconsolidated from ice’s financial statements as described above 

the characteristics of digital assets have been and may in the future continue to be exploited to facilitate illegal activity such as fraud money laundering tax evasion and ransomware scams which could adversely affect us 

digital assets and the digital asset industry are relatively new and in many cases lightly regulated or largely unregulated some types of digital assets particularly cryptocurrencies have characteristics such as the speed with which transactions can be conducted the ability to conduct transactions without the involvement of regulated intermediaries the ability to engage in transactions across multiple jurisdictions the irreversible nature of certain transactions and encryption technology that anonymizes these transactions that make those assets particularly susceptible to use in illegal activity such as fraud money laundering tax evasion and ransomware scams 

while we believe that bakkt’s risk management and compliance framework is reasonably designed to detect any such illicit activities we cannot ensure that bakkt will be able to detect any such illegal activity in all instances because the speed irreversibility and anonymity of certain digital asset transactions make them more difficult to track fraudulent transactions may be more likely to occur bakkt may be specifically targeted by individuals seeking to conduct fraudulent transfers and it may be difficult or impossible for bakkt to detect and avoid such transactions in certain circumstances 

bakkt is subject to antimoney laundering counter terrorist financing laws and regulations and anticorruption laws globally and there can be no assurance that its employees or agents will not violate such laws and regulations  

bakkt is subject to antimoney laundering and counter terrorist financing laws and regulations globally including the usa patriot act as well as economic and trade sanctions programs including those imposed and administered by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control or ofac under ofac’s economic sanctions program bakkt is prohibited from financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies and with persons and entities included in ofacs sanctions lists including its list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons bakkt has implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that its employees or agents will not violate such laws and regulations a failure by bakkt or its employees or agents to comply with such laws and regulations and subsequent judgment or settlement against bakkt under these laws could subject bakkt to monetary penalties damages andor have a significant reputational impact 

bakkt is also subject to anticorruption laws and regulations globally including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act bakkt has implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that its employees or agents will not violate such laws and regulations a failure by bakkt or its employees or agents to comply with such laws and regulations and subsequent judgment or settlement against bakkt under these laws could subject bakkt to monetary penalties damages andor have a significant reputational impact 

regulatory changes or actions may restrict the use of digital assets in a manner that adversely affects bakkt’s business prospects or operations and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

as digital assets including cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size governments have reacted differently to such digital assets with certain governments deeming them illegal and others allowing their use and trade ongoing and future regulatory actions may impact the ability of bakkt to continue to operate and such actions could affect the ability of bakkt to continue as a going concern which would have a material adverse effect on the business prospects or operations of bakkt and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

the cftc has designated bitcoin as a commodity and as such exchangetraded derivatives involving bitcoin are subject to the cftcs jurisdiction and enforcement powers although the cftc has suggested it is not particularly focused on pursuing such enforcement at this time in the event that the cftc does pursue such enforcement and ultimately shuts down an exchange on which bakkt’s bitcoin futures contract is traded it may have a significant adverse impact on bakkts business and plan of operations and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

the regulatory framework is unsettled with respect to many forms of digital assets which means that federal or state regulators may in the future curtail or prohibit the acquisition use or redemption of certain digital assets ownership of holding or trading in certain digital assets may be subject to sanction federal or state regulators may also take regulatory action that may increase the cost andor subject companies to additional regulation that custody or facilitate the trading of digital assets 

in addition as bakkt expands its business to new products and services it will come under the jurisdiction of additional regulators  both with respect to jurisdiction inside and outside the us and subject matter payments consumer protection and other areas any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws regulations or orders of 

any governmental authority including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws regulations or orders including those discussed in this risk factor may subject bakkt to significant fines penalties criminal and civil lawsuits forfeiture of significant assets and enforcement result in additional compliance and licensure requirements increase regulatory scrutiny of its business restrict bakkt’s operations and force bakkt to change its business practices make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements bakkt has implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that its employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations 

digital asset custodial solutions and related technology including bakkt’s systems and custodial arrangements are subject to risks related to a loss of funds due to theft of digital assets employee or vendor sabotage security and cybersecurity risks system failures and other operational issues and a lack of sufficient insurance which could cause damage to bakkts reputation and brand 

bakkts systems and custodial solutions involve the processing storage and transmission of digital assets including cryptocurrencies and data while bakkt will contractually limit the amount of exposure it will have in the event that digital assets are stolen or misappropriated we cannot guarantee that these limits will protect bakkt from additional liability and other damage the theft or misappropriation of digital assets held in custody by bakkt would likely result in financial loss reputational damage potential lack of trust from our customers in other business lines negative press coverage and diversion of bakkt management’s time and focus the secure storage and transmission of digital assets and data over networks will be a critical element of bakkt’s operations despite the defensive measures bakkt may take these threats may come from external factors such as governments organized crime hackers and other third parties such as outsourced or infrastructuresupport providers and application developers or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom bakkt has granted access to its systems 

digital asset transactions may be irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred digital assets may be irretrievable once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain an incorrect transfer of a digital asset generally will not be reversible and bakkt may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft it is possible that through computer or human error or through theft or criminal action the digital asset could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties or to uncontrolled accounts such events would have a material adverse effect on the ability of bakkt to continue as a going concern which would have a material adverse effect on our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

while bakkt maintains insurance policies those policies may not be adequate to reimburse bakkt for losses caused by security breaches and bakkt may lose digital assets valued in excess of the insurance policy without any recourse unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions in the event of loss or loss of utility value there is no public insurer such as the securities investor protection corporation or the fdic to offer recourse to bakkt or to any investor and the misappropriated digital assets may not easily be traced to the bad actor 

further when cryptocurrency custodial solutions or transfer venues whether involving bakkt systems or others experience system failures or other operational issues such events could result in a reduction in cryptocurrency prices or confidence and impact the success of bakkt and have a material adverse effect on the ability of bakkt to continue as a going concern 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to bakkt’s reputation business and financial condition 

bakkts business involves the collection storage processing and transmission of confidential information and users personal data including financial information and information about how users interact with bakkt’s platform bakkt has built its reputation on the premise that bakkt offers its partners and users a secure and convenient way to manage their digital assets an increasing number of organizations including large merchants businesses technology companies and financial institutions as well as government institutions have disclosed breaches of their information security systems some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks including on their websites mobile applications and infrastructure 

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized improper or illegal access to systems and information including users personal data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated may be difficult to detect quickly and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target unauthorized parties have attempted and bakkt expects that they will continue to attempt to gain access to bakkt’s systems or facilities through various means including but not limited to hacking into bakkt’s systems or facilities or those of its users partners or vendors and attempting to fraudulently induce users of bakkts systems including employees and users into disclosing user names passwords payment card information or 

other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access bakkt’s information technology systems threats can come from a variety of sources including criminal hackers hacktivists statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage and insider threats certain efforts may be supported by significant financial and technological resources making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persisting cyberattacks cyberextortion spear phishing and social engineering schemes the introduction of computer viruses or other malware and the physical destruction of all or portions of bakkt’s information technology and infrastructure could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data in bakkts systems although bakkt has developed systems and processes designed to protect data it manages prevent data loss and other security breaches and effectively respond to known and potential risks and bakkt expects to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections there can be no assurance that these security measures will provide absolute security or prevent breaches or attacks 

bakkt’s information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches and third parties may be able to access bakkts users personal or proprietary information banking digital asset and payment card data or other sensitive data that are stored on or accessible through those systems bakkt has experienced from time to time and may experience in the future breaches of its security measures due to human error malfeasance insider threats system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities actual or perceived breaches of bakkts security could among other things 

• interrupt bakkt’s operations 

• result in bakkt’s systems or services being unavailable 

• result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and other laws 

• materially harm bakkt’s reputation and brand 

• result in significant regulatory scrutiny investigations fines penalties and other legal and financial exposure 

• cause bakkt to incur significant remediation costs 

• lead to loss of user confidence in or decreased use of bakkt’s products and services 

• divert the attention of management from the operation of bakkt’s business 

• result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from bakkt to bakkt’s customers and their business partners as a result of losses to them or claims by them and 

• adversely affect bakkt’s business and results of operations 

in addition any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting the information technology or infrastructure of companies bakkt acquires or of bakkt’s users partners or vendors including data center and cloud computing providers could have similar negative effects actual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches may lead to claims against bakkt 

in addition under payment card rules and its contracts with its card processors if there is a breach of payment card information that bakkt stores or that is stored by its direct payment card processing vendors bakkt could be liable to the payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees bakkt expects to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches financial services regulators in various jurisdictions including the us and the eu have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud which could impose significant costs require bakkt to change its business practices make it more difficult for new users to join bakkt and reduce the ease of use of bakkts products which could harm bakkts business while bakkt maintains insurance policies they may not be adequate to reimburse bakkt for losses caused by security breaches

recent developments 

covid19 

the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions globally and has led governmental authorities to take unprecedented measures to mitigate the spread of the disease including travel bans border closings business closures quarantines and shelterinplace orders and to take actions designed to stabilize markets and promote economic growth 

from an operational perspective our businesses including our exchanges clearing houses listing venues data services businesses and mortgage platforms have remained open and we do not have any plans to close any of our business operations as a result of the covid19 pandemic however due to the covid19 pandemic we have taken preventative measures and implemented contingency plans and currently most of our employees are working remotely in response to government mandates we closed all of our office facilities between early march and late april 2020 with only our operationally essential employees working onsite at our facilities for business continuity purposes as various governments began easing orders requiring office closures in late april we began a phased reopening of certain of our office facilities allowing a limited number of operationally nonessential workers to also work onsite these measures are in compliance as necessary with local government directives and social distancing directives we continue to monitor local government mandates in determining our office reopenings reclosures and workrelated travel 

global health concerns relating to covid19 and preventive measures taken to reduce its spread have created significant volatility in financial markets which has resulted in higher trading volumes for some of our products and increased demand for our services 

the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business will depend largely on future developments including the duration spread and severity of the outbreak the distribution public acceptance and widespread use and effectiveness of vaccines against covid19 and the actions taken to contain the spread of the disease or mitigate its impact we continue to monitor this dynamic situation including guidance and regulations issued by us and other governmental authorities in light of the continually evolving nature of the covid19 outbreak we are not able at this time to estimate the ultimate effect of the pandemic on our business results of operations or financial condition in the future 

acquisition of ellie mae 

on september 4 2020 we acquired ellie mae for aggregate consideration of 114 billion from private equity firm thoma bravo ellie mae is a cloudbased technology solution provider for the mortgage finance industry through its digital lending platform ellie mae provides technology solutions to participants in the mortgage supply chain including over

bakkt transaction 

additionally on january 11 2021 bakkt our majorityowned indirect subsidiary entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger or the merger agreement to combine with vpc impact acquisition holdings or vih a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by victory park capital pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement vih plans to domesticate and become a delaware corporation the “domestication” and be renamed “bakkt holdings inc” “bakkt pubco” and following the domestication a subsidiary of vih plans to merge with and into bakkt the “merger” with bakkt surviving the merger upon the consummation of the merger the “closing” bakkt pubco plans to be organized in an “upc” structure in which substantially all of the assets and the business of bakkt pubco will be held by bakkt and its subsidiaries and bakkt pubco’s only direct assets will consist of its membership interests in bakkt upon the closing bakkt pubco is expected to have a class of common stock listed on the new york stock exchange 

also on january 11 2021 concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement vih entered into subscription agreements with certain investors collectively the “pipe investors” pursuant to which and on the terms and subject to the conditions of which the pipe investors have collectively subscribed for additional equity in bakkt pubco for an aggregate purchase price equal to 325 million the “pipe investment” the pipe investors include ice and we committed to purchase additional equity in bakkt pubco that would comprise up to 50 million of the pipe investment the pipe investment will be consummated immediately prior to the closing 

as part of the transaction bakkt’s existing equity holders and management will roll 100 of their equity into the combined company assuming no shareholders of vih exercise their redemption rights current bakkt equity holders including ice will own approximately 78 of the combined company vih’s public shareholders will own approximately 8 vpc will own 2 and pipe investors a group that will also include us will own approximately 12 of the issued and outstanding common stock of the combined company at closing ice is expected to have a 65 economic interest in the combined company at the closing which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2021 the proposed transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including the approval of vih’s shareholders and certain regulatory approvals at the closing ice which is expected to own a majority of the common stock of the bakkt pubco immediately following the merger will enter into a voting agreement with bakkt pubco the “voting agreement” pursuant to the voting agreement for so long as we own at least 50 of the total voting power of bakkt pubco common stock we will agree to vote on any matter submitted to a vote or consent of the stockholders of bakkt pubco any shares of common stock of bakkt pubco owned by us in excess of 30 of the outstanding voting power of bakkt pubco in the same percentages for and against the relevant matter as votes are cast by all stockholders of bakkt pubco other than ice as a consequence of the voting agreement and bakkt pubco’s other governance arrangements following the closing we expect to reclassify bakkt pubco as our equity method investment and bakkt will therefore cease to be consolidated with our financial statements 

consolidated financial highlights 

the following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented dollars in millions except per share amounts 





1 the adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance adjusted net income attributable to ice and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ice common stockholders are presented net of taxes these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap see “ nongaap financial measures” below 

• revenues less transactionbased expenses increased 834 million in 2020 from 2019 the increase in revenues includes 7 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker us dollar in 2020 from 2019 

• revenues less transactionbased expenses increased 223 million in 2019 from 2018 the increase in revenues includes 34 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the stronger us dollar in 2019 from 2018 

• operating expenses increased 474 million in 2020 from 2019 the increase in operating expenses includes 2 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker us dollar in 2020 from 2019 

• operating expenses increased 133 million in 2019 from 2018 the increase in operating expenses includes 14 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the stronger us dollar in 2019 from 2018 

• in connection with our acquisition of mers we recorded a 110 million gain in other income during 2018 

• the effective tax rate in 2020 is higher than the effective tax rate in 2019 primarily due to uk tax law changes enacted in july 2020 partially offset by favorable state apportionment changes as a result of our acquisition of ellie mae as well as favorable changes in certain international tax provisions as part of the us federal tax cuts and jobs act or tcja in 2019 

• the effective tax rate in 2019 was higher than the effective tax rate in 2018 primarily due to the 2018 discrete tax benefits from the acquisition of mers and the divestiture of trayport exceeding the net increased tax benefits recorded in 2019 from certain international tax provisions under the tcja 

business environment and market trends 

our business environment has been characterized by 

• globalization of marketplaces customers and competitors 

• growing customer demand for workflow efficiency and automation 

• commodity interest rate and financial markets uncertainty 

• growing demand for data to inform customers risk management and investment decisions 

• evolving increasing and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions 

• price volatility increasing customers demand for risk management services 

• increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies 

• customers preference to manage risk in markets demonstrating the greatest depth of liquidity and product diversity 

• the evolution of existing products and new product innovation to serve emerging customer needs and changing industry agreements 

• rising demand for speed data data capacity and connectivity by market participants necessitating increased investment in technology and 

• consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading clearing and listings 

recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets centralized clearing and access to data all of which are important aspects of our product offering however some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered in addition some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several nonus regulations are inconsistent with us rules as the evolution continues legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data as a result it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us as discussed more fully in item 1 “ business  regulation” included in this annual report brexit the implementation of mifid ii and other regulations may result in operational regulatory andor business risk 

we have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or transaction activity in any one asset class in addition we have increased our portion of nontransaction and clearing revenues from 34 in 2014 to 48 in 2020 this nontransaction revenue includes data services listings and various mortgage technology solutions 

many of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels we anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends including the following 

• increasing global regulatory demands 

• greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations 

• greater emphasis on risk management 

• market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes 

• the move to passive investing and indexation 

• ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets 

• increased automation of fixed income and other less automated markets 

• the development of new data products 

• the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity 

• new entrants and 

• increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions 

we continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams and prudently manage expenses in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data clearing markets and technology solutions 

segment results 

we previously operated as two reportable business segments but effective october 1 2020 we realigned our businesses as part of a review of and changes in our organizational structure following our acquisition of ellie mae as a result we changed our internal financial reporting and determined that a change in reportable segments had occurred prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change our segments do not engage in intersegment transactions 

as of december 31 2020 our business is conducted through three reportable business segments comprised of the following 

• our exchanges segment includes our trade execution and clearing within our global futures network and nyse businesses various data and connectivity services that are directly related to those exchange platforms administration fees and our nyse listings business trade execution and clearing products include energy agricultural and metals financial futures and options cash equities equity options otc and other 

• our fixed income and data services segment includes trade execution and clearing within our ice bonds and cds businesses pricing and reference data analytics indices consolidated feeds and our ice global network businesses and 

• our mortgage technology segment includes our mers simplifile and ellie mae mortgage services businesses this segment includes origination technology network and closing solutions data and analytics registrations and other 

while revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than one segment we directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so otherwise we use a prorata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all segments our october 1 2020 change in business segment presentation triggered a reallocation of our segment operating expenses prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change 

for details on trends in recent prior year periods refer to our 2019 and 2018 annual reports on form 10k

the 222 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 and 2019 was driven by a 148 million increase in net income and the noncash impact of deferred taxes of 125 million partially offset by the timing of nyse collections on increased billings of 119 million and higher income taxes paid as a result of the uk government accelerating its required income tax installment payments in 2020 the remaining change is due to fluctuations in our working capital and the timing of various payments such as transactionrelated expenses

we have a 37 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility or the credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement with wells fargo bank na as primary administrative agent issuing lender and swingline lender bank of america na as syndication agent backup administrative agent and swingline lender and the lenders party thereto as of december 31 2020 of the 37 billion that is currently available for borrowing under the credit facility 24 billion is required to backstop the amount outstanding under our commercial paper program and 171 million is required to support certain brokerdealer and other subsidiary commitments the amount required to backstop the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings the remaining 11 billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes including but not limited to acting as a backstop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program 

on august 21 2020 we entered into a 750 million 18month senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility with a maturity date of february 21 2022 we borrowed in full under the facility on september 3 2020 and the proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the ellie mae acquisition we had the option to prepay the facility in whole or in part at any time and paid off the full balance of the loan on december 16 2020 interest on borrowings under this term loan facility were based on the principal amount outstanding at libor plus an applicable margin which was equal to 1125

our commercial paper program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable shortterm interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to delever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities we had net issuances of 11 billion under our commercial paper program during 2020 

upon maturity of our commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper to mitigate this risk we maintain an undrawn backstop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount which meets or exceeds the amount issued under our commercial paper program at any time if we were not able to issue new commercial paper we have the option of drawing on the backstop revolving facility however electing to do so would result in higher interest expense

capital return 

in december 2019 our board approved an aggregate of 24 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective january 1 2020 the 24 billion replaced the previous amount approved by the board 

during 2020 we repurchased 136 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of 12 billion including 104 million shares at a cost of 948 million under our rule 10b51 trading plan and 32 million shares at a cost of 299 million on the open market in 2019 we repurchased 174 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of 15 billion including 161 million shares at a cost of 14 billion under our rule 10b51 trading plan and 13 million shares at a cost of 100 million on the open market shares repurchased are held in treasury stock 

we discontinued stock repurchases and terminated our rule 10b51 trading plan in august 2020 in connection with our ellie mae acquisition the remaining balance of board approved funds for future repurchase is 12 billion the approval of our board for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock in addition our board may increase or decrease the amount available for repurchases from time to time 

from time to time we enter into rule 10b51 trading plans as authorized by our board to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock the timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a rule 10b51 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions in making a determination regarding any stock repurchases management considers multiple factors including overall stock market conditions our common stock price performance the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings our expected free cash flow and working capital needs our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources 

during 2020 we paid cash dividends of 120 per share of our common stock in the aggregate including quarterly dividends of 030 per share for an aggregate payout of 669 million which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years 

future capital requirements 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate of growth across our segments strategic plans and acquisitions available sources for financing activities required and discretionary technology and clearing initiatives regulatory requirements the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products the geographic mix of our business and potential stock repurchases 

we currently expect to incur capital expenditures including operational and real estate capital expenditures and to incur software development costs that are eligible for capitalization ranging in the aggregate between 400 million and 

430 million in 2021 which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology business integration and the continued growth of our businesses 

in december 2019 our board approved an aggregate of 24 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective on january 1 2020 as of december 31 2020 we had 12 billion authorized for future repurchases of our common stock refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional details on our stock repurchase program 

our board has adopted a quarterly dividend policy providing that dividends will be approved quarterly by the board or the audit committee taking into account factors such as our evolving business model prevailing business conditions our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives and our financial results and capital requirements without a predetermined net income payout ratio for the first quarter of 2021 we announced a 033 per share dividend payable on march 31 2021 to stockholders of record as of march 17 2021 

other than the facilities for the ice clearing houses our credit facility and our commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have for liquidity and capital resources with third parties see notes 10 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion in the event of any strategic acquisitions mergers or investments or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders we may incur additional debt issue additional equity to raise necessary funds repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend however we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us see “risk factors and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

nongaap measures 

we use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent gaap measures or that supplement the information provided by our gaap measures we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance 

we use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance including in this annual report and believe that these measures when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than gaap measures alone in addition we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making periodtoperiod comparisons of results because the adjustments to gaap are not reflective of our core business performance 

these financial measures are not presented in accordance with or as an alternative to gaap financial measures and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies we encourage investors to review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report including our consolidated financial statements to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons 

the table below outlines our adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income attributable to ice common stockholders and adjusted earnings per share which are nongaap measures that are calculated by making adjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance these measures including the adjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments in millions except for percentages and per share amounts are as follows 



amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles are included in nongaap adjustments as excluding these noncash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results 

acquisitionrelated transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses except for those that are directly related to the announcement closing financing or termination of a transaction however we adjust for the acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs relating to acquisitions such as ellie mae and interactive data given the 

magnitude of the 114 billion and 56 billion purchase prices respectively of these acquisitions we also adjust for the acquisitionrelated transaction costs related to the expected merger between bakkt and vih due to the significance of the transaction the integration of interactive data was completed by june 2018 in 2020 we also included a 10 million adjustment for bridge2 solutions acquisition costs resulting from a bakkt incentive award market condition estimation adjustment as an acquisitionrelated success fee this adjustment was directly related to the march 2020 capital call to fund the acquisition of bridge2 solutions and we believe is therefore appropriate since we exclude costs directly related to financing a transaction 

the extinguishment payment on the 2020 senior notes is included as a nongaap adjustment as it relates to the june 2020 early redemption of senior notes with an original maturity of december 1 2020 as a result of our new senior notes offering in may 2020 these costs include both a makewhole redemption payment and duplicative interest and are not considered part of our normal operations we also adjust for preacquisition interest expense on the august 2020 debt issued to fund a portion of the purchase price of our ellie mae acquisition as we do not consider this to be reflective of our normal operations 

we include the 2019 impairment of exchange registration intangible assets on ice futures singapore as a nongaap adjustment this impairment is not based on our core business operations but rather was a result of the estimated fair value of an acquired intangible asset falling below its carrying value see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

we include the 2020 and 2019 promissory note impairment charges on work performed by the original plan processor on the cat as nongaap adjustments these are included as nongaap adjustments as these are not considered a part of our core business operations see additional discussion on the cat above in item 1a risk factors in this annual report 

in addition we also include the following items as nongaap adjustments as each of these are not considered a part of our core business operations 

• 2020 impairment of software developed at our bakkt subsidiary since it relates to the buildout of a fundamental software design vs a recurring upgrade 

• 2020 accrual for potential legal settlements 

• 2020 accruals relating to a regulatory settlement 

• 2020 the 35 million gain on the fair value adjustment of our euroclear equity investment and the 20 million gain on the sale of our bids equity investment 

• 2018 the gain recognized on our initial majority investment in mers in connection with our acquisition of 100 of the remaining mers interests 

• 2018 the impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets and employee severance costs related to the closure of ice futures canada and ice clear canada and 

• 2018 a subsequent adjustment to reduce the gain on the divestiture of trayport 

the tax items in nongaap adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pretax nongaap adjustments or tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance the following taxrelated items are included as nongaap adjustments 

• deferred tax adjustments on acquisitionrelated intangibles including the impact of uk and us state tax law changes and apportionment updates as well as foreign tax law changes which resulted in deferred tax expensebenefit of 36 million 8 million and 5 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

• deferred tax benefits of 11 million in 2018 resulting from changes in estimates as a result of the enactment of the tcja which reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and 

• other tax adjustments of 3 million in 2019 for audit settlement payments primarily related to preacquisition tax matters in connection with our acquisition of nyse in 2013 and other tax adjustments in 2018 including a 17 million tax benefit on the sale of trayport partially offset by an audit settlement for a preacquisition period in connection with our acquisition of nyse in 2013

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as described in notes 3 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this annual report certain clearing house collateral and bakkt custodial assets are reported offbalance sheet we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following presents our contractual obligations which we intend to fund from existing cash as well as cash flow from operations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2020 in millions 



purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments listed above 841 billion in cash margin deposits guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund the cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them ice ngx administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts it has an equal and offsetting claim to and from its respective participants on opposite sides of the physicallysettled contract each of which is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable 

we have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits or utbs as of december 31 2020 our cumulative utbs were 188 million and interest and penalties related to utbs were 39 million we are under examination by various tax authorities we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax interest and penalties if any that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our utbs 

as of december 31 2020 we through nyse have net obligations of 130 million related to our pension and other benefit programs the date of payment under these net obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs 

in addition the future funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the sros and brokerdealers to date however funding has been provided solely by the sros and future funding is expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the sec and subsequently collected by industry members see  nongaap measures above 

new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us 

critical accounting policies 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and reevaluate them on a periodic basis based on these factors we make estimates and judgments about among other things the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies among others affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results assets and liabilities 

goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 

assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets including identified intangible assets we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles such as customer relationships trademarks technology trading products data exchange registrations backlog trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift our judgments and estimates may change which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not 

in performing the allocation of the acquisitions purchase price to assets and liabilities we consider among other factors the intended use of the acquired assets analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business at the acquisition date a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist we continue to review and assess our estimates assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by gaap which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition accordingly these estimates and assumptions are subject to change which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements estimation uncertainty may exist due to the sensitivity of the respective fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of an acquired business in our discounted cash flow models significant assumptions typically include revenue growth rates and expense synergies that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate 

our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and we have identified four reporting units which have been updated in 2020 to reflect our new segment presentation our reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are the nyse other exchanges fixed income and data services and mortgage technology reporting units these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinitelived intangibles to its estimated fair value 

in accordance with our adoption of accounting standards update 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  or asu2017 for both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible impairment testing we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite 

lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if the fair value of the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the difference alternatively we may choose to bypass the qualitative option and perform quantitative testing to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value for our goodwill impairment testing we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and apply the quantitative approach for our testing of indefinitelived intangible assets we apply qualitative and quantitative approaches 

application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows longterm growth rates of our business operating margins discount rates weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets these estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment and changes to these estimates and assumptions as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor impairment during 2019 we recorded an impairment charge of 31 million on the remaining value of exchange registration intangible assets on ice futures singapore as a result of a decrease in fair value determined during our annual impairment testing we did not record any impairments in 2020 as a result of our goodwill or indefinitelived impairment testing 

we are also required to evaluate other finitelived intangible assets for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable if impairment indicators are present then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these longlived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable if an asset is not recoverable the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us uk and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse 

sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 or sab 118 provided guidance for companies that had not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja in the period of enactment allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts as of december 31 2018 we had completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tcja we reaffirmed our position that we were not subject to transition tax under the tcja as of december 31 2017 in addition we concluded that the 764 million of deferred tax benefit recorded in the 2017 financial statements was a reasonable estimate of the tcja’s impact on our deferred tax and no further adjustments are necessary 

the fasb staff also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of global intangible lowtaxed income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred we have completed our analysis of the effects of these provisions and have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred 

we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position if the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 

we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing 

and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter at any point in time many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities changes in facts and circumstances issuance of new regulations and resolution of tax audits 

we believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 




 

item 7 a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a result of our operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure manage monitor and report risk exposures which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2020 and 2019 our cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments were 20 billion and 22 billion respectively of which 245 million and 282 million respectively were denominated in pounds sterling euros or canadian dollars and the remaining amounts are denominated in us dollars we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes a hypothetical 50 decrease in shortterm interest rates would decrease annual pretax earnings by 5 million as of december 31 2020 assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2020 we had 165 billion in outstanding debt of which 129 billion relates to our fixed rate senior notes the remaining amount outstanding of 36 billion relates to 24 billion outstanding under our commercial paper program and 12 billion of floating rate senior notes each of which bear interest at fluctuating rates and 6 million under a line of credit at our ice india subsidiary a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates relating to the amounts of floating rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2020 would decrease annual pretax earnings by 36 million assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper program decreased from 184 as of december 31 2019 to 040 as of december 31 2020 the decrease in the commercial paper program weighted average interest rate was primarily due to the decision by the us federal reserve to decrease the federal funds shortterm interest rate by 150 basis points in march 2020 due to the impact of covid19 on financial markets which impacted the liquidity and pricing volatility for all commercial paper issuances the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in shortterm interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as an international business we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling canadian dollars or euros and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros certain assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2020 and 2019 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table dollars in millions except exchange rates 





1 represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year 

we have a significant part of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros in both 2020 and 2019 13 of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros and in 2020 and 2019 11 and 12 respectively of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes the us equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly 

foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables occurs through our operations which are received in or paid in pounds sterling canadian dollars or euros due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of 5 million in both 2020 and 2019 inclusive of the impact of foreign currency hedging transactions the foreign currency transaction gainslosses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar a 10 adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2020 assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity would result in a foreign currency loss of 15 million 

we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2020 and 2019 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities 

we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using a current rate of exchange with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account a component of equity our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below in millions 



foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss within our balance sheet see the table below for the portion of equity attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments as well as the activity by year included within our statement of other comprehensive income the impact of 

the foreign currency exchange rate differences in the table below were primarily driven by fluctuations of the pound sterling as compared to the us dollar which were 13665 13260 and 12756 as of december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 



the future impact on our business relating to the uk leaving the eu and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time including future impacts on currency exchange rates 

credit risk 

we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests 

clearing house cash deposit risks 

the ice clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit market and liquidity risks refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ice clearing houses cash and cash equivalent deposits which were 841 billion as of december 31 2020 while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits as the ice clearing houses may pass on interest revenues minus costs to the clearing members this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated 

• credit risk when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures credit risk is managed by using exposure limits depending on the credit profile of the counterparty as well as the nature and maturity of transactions our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk we seek to substantially mitigate the credit risk associated with investments by placing them with governments wellcapitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties 

an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties our policies require diversification of counterparties banks financial institutions bond issuers and funds so as to avoid a concentration of risk 

• liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency in the right place and at the right time to mitigate this risk the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets for example holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks 

• interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise and cause the value of securities we hold or invest in to decline if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity and interest rates had risen the sale might be made at a loss relative to the carrying value our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments for example where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements the clearing houses invest 

cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities in addition the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt for example us treasury securities and supranational debt instruments euro cash deposits only with short dated maturities 

• security issuer risk security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on the payment when the security matures or debt is serviced this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments 

• investment counterparty risk investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and thus fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral to securities of high quality issuers when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements our clearing houses take delivery of the securities underlying the reverse repurchase arrangement in custody accounts under clearing house control additionally the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount the typical haircut for high quality sovereign debt is 2 of the reverse repurchase amount which provides additional excess collateral thus in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the counterparty’s obligation 

the ice clearing houses may use thirdparty investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house such advisors do not hold clearing member cash or cash equivalent deposits or the underlying investments clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians including jpmorgan chase bank na citibank na bny mellon bmo harris na and euroclear bank brussels for nonus dollar deposits the ice clearing houses employ or may employ multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives 

• crosscurrency margin deposit risk each of the ice clearing houses may permit posting of crosscurrency collateral to satisfy margin requirements for example accepting margin deposits denominated in us dollars to secure a euro margin obligation the ice clearing houses mitigate the risk of a currency value exposure by applying a “haircut” to the currency posted as margin at a level viewed as sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of currency volatility crosscurrency balances are markedtomarket on a daily basis should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a sameday basis 

impact of inflation 

we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant in the event of inflation we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants as the prices that we charge are not governed by longterm contracts

 regulation of our securities business 

 regulation of our data business

regulatory changes 

domestic and foreign policy makers continue to review their legal frameworks governing financial markets and periodically change the laws and regulations that apply to our business and to our customers’ businesses our key areas of focus on these evolving efforts are 



leverage ratio requirements the final rule also revised the treatment of the leverage ratio capital requirement for derivatives that a bank centrally clears on behalf of its clients to permit both cash and noncash forms of initial margin and variation margin received from a client to offset the replacement cost and potential future exposure for client cleared derivatives only the compliance date for the revised regulation is january 1 2022 however early adoption is permitted beginning april 1 2020 

 in addition in october 2019 the sec proposed a change to rule 608 that would eliminate the provision allowing market data fee changes proposed by nms plans to become immediately effective further in january 2020 the sec requested comment on a proposed order directing the exchanges and finra to submit a plan to create a new single nms plan to replace the three existing nms plans that govern the dissemination of realtime consolidated equity market data for nms stocks if implemented these changes could impact nyse’s revenues from the consolidated “sip” feeds

item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe could materially adversely affect us other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect us in the future if any of the risks discussed below actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected accordingly you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this annual report 

global economic political and financial market events or conditions may negatively impact our business 

adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment government shutdowns currency fluctuations interest rate changes geopolitical events climate change international trade disputes including the imposition of tariffs or other protectionist measures actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending and in turn impact our business if our customers reduce spending workforce trading activity or demand for financial data as a result of challenges in the prevailing economic markets our revenues could decline 

a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from market data fees and fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets our market databased revenues are largely subscriptionbased or recurring and are generated from a range of global financial and commodity markets including pricing and reference data exchange data analytics feeds index services desktops and connectivity solutions for our transactionbased revenues we derive a significant percentage from trading in global energy and agriculturalrelated futures and options contracts as well as equity transactions and global interest rate contracts the market data subscriptions and trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of spending or trading activity for any reason including 

 a reduction in our overall trading volume could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenues a reduction in trading volumes could also result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for our market data which would further reduce our overall revenue 

further nyse’s revenue increases when more companies are seeking access to public markets and on the nyse specifically a stagnation or a decline in the ipo market or issuers choosing to list on venues other than the nyse could have an adverse effect on our revenues 

the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the uks exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

in 2016 a majority of voters in the uk approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit brexit has created political and economic uncertainty and instability in the global markets including currency and credit markets particularly in the uk and eu in addition political and economic uncertainty surrounding the terms of brexit has in the past led to and the outcome of brexit could lead to certain macroeconomic conditions that adversely affect our business adverse macroeconomic consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates legal uncertainty potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate andor prohibitive laws and regulations may adversely affect both demand for our products and services and our ability to deliver our products and services into the eu the long term effects of brexit will depend in part on any agreements the uk makes or does not make to retain access to eu markets following a transitional period 

following the formation of a majority conservative government in december 2019 the uk withdrew from the eu on january 31 2020 the future relationship between the uk and the eu remains uncertain as the uk and the eu work through the transition period that provides time for them to negotiate the details of their future relationship the transition period is currently expected to end on december 31 2020 and if no agreement is reached the default scenario would be a “nodeal” brexit in the event of a nodeal brexit the uk will leave the eu with no agreements in place beyond any temporary arrangements that have or may be put in place by the eu or individual eu member states and the uk as part of nodeal contingency efforts and those conferred by mutual membership of the world trade organization given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what financial trade and legal implications the uk leaving the eu with no agreements in place would have and how such withdrawal would affect us a large portion of our operations are conducted in the uk as a result a nodeal brexit could restrict access to our services by persons located in the eu or make access more expensive which could adversely affect our operations and profitability 

our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to increased legislation and regulatory scrutiny and we face the risk of changes to our regulatory environment and business in the future 

we are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in many jurisdictions around the world and in particular in the us and the uk we face the risk of significant actions by regulatory and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments which may affect our business the activity of our market participants and our results among other things as a result of regulators and tax authorities enforcing existing laws and regulations we could be censured fined prohibited from pursuing certain acquisitions or engaging in some of our business activities subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities including fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory pricing restrictions also known as frand or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees including settlement payments interest payments and penalty payments in many cases our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions 

there is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could be imposed this could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients’ overall trading volume through our exchanges and demand for our market data and other services the us government in particular has indicated a goal of reforming many aspects of existing financial services regulations some areas identified as subject to potential change amendment or repeal include the doddfrank act and the authorities of the federal reserve and fsoc however it is unknown at this time the effect that such passage adoption or modification will have positively or negatively on our industry or on us 

there is also increasing public concern regarding data privacy and data protection and many jurisdictions have passed laws in this area such as the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions the laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us regulation of privacy and data protection often times require monitoring of and changes to our data practices in regard to the collection use disclosure storage transfer andor security of personal and sensitive information 

these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our stockholders and creditors for example the adoption and implementation of position limit rules in the us and the eu could have an impact on our commodities business if comparable trading venues in foreign jurisdictions are not subject to equivalent rules position limits became effective in the eu beginning january 2018 and in certain cases the position limits are either lower or higher than the limits in us equivalent contracts these divergent regulations may cause us to move products from one jurisdiction to another as a result of business risks and competitive challenges could significantly increase the regulatory compliance costs for our customers and could significantly impact trading activity which could have a negative impact on our business 

us and eu legal and regulatory developments in response to the global financial crisis in particular the doddfrank act emir emir 22 mifid ii and the bmr have significantly altered and propose to further alter the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability the enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes most likely to affect our businesses are position limit rules in the us and the eu nondiscriminatory access provisions of mifid ii interoperability and margin rules in emir enhanced regulatory capital liquidity and leverage rules in basel iii and capital requirements directive iv access rules under the bmr the nonharmonization of margin requirements implementation of a financial transaction tax access to our benchmarks and maintaining our exchanges’ abilities to operate as sros with related immunity for the discharge of their regulatory functions as the operator of global businesses the lack of harmonization in international financial reform efforts could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in multiple jurisdictions 

the doddfrank act established enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the fsoc ice clear credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the fsoc and as a result is subject to additional oversight by the cftc compliance with these requirements has resulted in and will continue to result in additional operating costs 

in 2016 the sec approved a plan to establish a marketwide consolidated audit trail or cat to improve regulators’ ability to monitor trading activity in 2018 the first phase of implementation went live and required sro participants to begin reporting to the cat due to delays in implementation and failure to implement required functionality there is an increased risk to sros which include us of regulatory action by the sec in addition to increased risk in connection with our regulatory obligations implementation of the cat could result in significant additional expenditures which may not be reimbursed funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the sros and brokerdealers to date however funding has been provided solely by the sros partly in exchange for promissory notes which increases the risk that sros including us will not be reimbursed for costs expended to date due to delays and failures in implementation and functionality by the original plan processor as well as recently published proposals by the sec for an amended timeline and implementation structure we recorded promissory note impairment charges of 16 million in 2019 we believe the risk that sros are not reimbursed has increased resulting in this impairment until the sec approves a funding model that shares the cost of the cat between the sros and brokerdealers the sros may continue to incur additional costs which may become significant and may not be reimbursed as of december 31 2019  we have accrued approximately 7 million as a receivable in connection with our portion of expenses related to the cat implementation 

we are subject to tax laws regulations rulings and audits in multiple us and nonus jurisdictions that could have a significant impact on our business and lead to additional expenditures for us or our customers for example there have been discussions in various jurisdictions around financial transaction or digital service tax frameworks implementation of any new or amended taxes or regulations could impact our global operations or trading volumes 

other enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations 

our compliance and risk management methods as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations might not be effective which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators 

our ability to comply with existing rules regulations and laws and changing rules regulations and laws largely depends on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel regulators periodically review our ability to selfregulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including selfregulatory standards in particular certain of our businesses associated with the nyse group are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations policies and procedures if we fail to comply with any of these obligations regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business 

our acquisitions expose us to new regulatory requirements for example as a result of our acquisition of interactive data we operate an secregistered investment adviser investment advisers are subject to significant regulatory obligations under the investment advisers act prior to this acquisition none of our businesses were registered under the investment advisers act compliance with the investment advisers act and other regulatory requirements gives rise to costs and expenses that may be material in addition our acquisition of the bondpoint ats in january 2018 and our acquisition of tmc bonds in july 2018 exposes us to increased exposure to regulatory scrutiny from the sec finra and msrb 

our regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders embargo future business activity or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses we have settled certain regulatory actions in the past including nyses settlement with the sec in march 2018 in which we agreed to pay a 14 million civil monetary penalty we continue to face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity of our business any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our financial condition operating results or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business further any settlement consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or regulatory agencies begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities finally the implementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to remain competitive and grow our business 

our business is subject to the impact of financial markets volatility including the prices and interest rates underlying our derivative products due to conditions that are beyond our control 

trading volume in our markets and products is largely driven by the degree of volatility  the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations  in prices and levels of the underlying commodities securities indices financial benchmarks or other instruments volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates opportunities for investment and speculative or arbitrage trading were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices or levels of the underlying commodities securities indices benchmarks or other instruments of our products we could experience lower trading volumes slower growth or declines in revenues 

factors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility and thus trading volumes include 

 any one or more of these factors which are beyond our control may reduce trading activity which could make our markets less attractive as a source of liquidity and in turn could further discourage existing and potential market participants and thus accelerate a decline in the level of trading activity and potentially related services such as data or clearing further lower market volatility could also result in more exchanges competing for trading volumes to maintain their growth if any of these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets could be jeopardized because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our current products and services decline for any reason we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues which would cause our net income to decline 

systems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry could negatively impact us 

highprofile system failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our business and result in a loss of confidence in our technology and our markets regulatory investigations fines and penalties and business activity slowdown or interruptions further regulators have imposed requirements for trading platforms that have been costly for us to implement and could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services in particular the sec’s regulation systems compliance and integrity or regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations subject portions of our securities and derivatives trading platforms and other technological systems related to our clearing houses trade repositories and the us sef to more extensive regulation and oversight ensuring our compliance with the requirements of regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations requires significant implementation costs as well as increased ongoing administrative expenses and burdens in addition any expansion of the ice systems that are determined to be in scope for regulation sci could result in significant additional expenditures 

our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cyberattacks hacking and other cybersecurity risks especially in light of our role in the global financial marketplace which could result in wrongful manipulation disclosure destruction or use of our information or that of a third party or which could make our participants unable or reluctant to use our electronic platforms 

the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to reliably transact on our electronic platforms and provide financial data services are critical elements of our operations some of our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential client and other data including client portfolio information if anyone gains improper access to our electronic platforms networks or databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify our confidential information or that of a third party breaches of our cybersecurity measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business our networks and those of our participants thirdparty service providers and external market infrastructures may be vulnerable to compromise unauthorized access security technology failure computer viruses social engineering denial of service attacks terrorism ransomware attacks firewall or encryption failures or other security problems resulting in loss of data integrity information disclosure unavailability or fraud the financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of political protest activism and financial gain and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for cyberattack and other information security threats further former employees of companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly 

although we have not been subject to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity events including distributed denial of service attacks malware infections phishing web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size for example we experienced a coordinated set of sophisticated distributed denial of service or ddos attacks in 2019 that activated our detection and response measures which mitigated the impact in response to these threats we also engaged our threat intelligence and risk assessment functions to perform rootcause analysis and continue to refine controls while we operate an information security program that is designed to prevent detect track and mitigate cyber incidents and that has detected and mitigated such incidents in the past we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against future attacks losses or reduced trading volume in our markets any such attacks could result in reputational damage cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose customers cause us to experience lower current and future trading volumes or incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive position in addition given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or disable or degrade systems a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected and we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely the extent of a particular cyber incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while such an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it which may compound damages before the incident is discovered or remediated additionally as threats continue to evolve and increase and as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous we may be required 

to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities which could adversely impact our net income 

further cybersecurity threats to and incidents involving vendors and other thirdparties who support our activities  particularly those with lesssophisticated defenses  could impact us during 2019 we became aware of three separate vendors who were materially impacted by significant ransomware attacks although we were able to shift reliance away from each of these vendors quickly these incidents demonstrate the potential for cybersecurity incidents of third parties to have a material impact despite the efforts we make to minimize concentration risk and ensure the cyber resiliency of our vendors 

owning clearing houses exposes us to risks including risks related to defaults by clearing members risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses 

there are risks inherent in operating clearing houses including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members market liquidity risks defaults by clearing members and risks associated with custody and investing margin or guaranty fund assets provided by clearing members to our clearing houses which could subject our business to substantial losses for example clearing members have transferred an aggregate amount of cash in ice clear europe relating to margin and guaranty funds of 325 billion as of december 31 2019 and a total of 650 billion for all of our clearing houses as of december 31 2019  the ice clearing houses may use thirdparty investment advisors for investment of cash assets subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house and may add or change the investment managers from time to time to the extent available ice clear credit holds the us dollar cash and us treasuries that clearing members transfer to satisfy their original margin and guaranty fund requirements at its account at the federal reserve with respect to other clearing member cash posted ice clear credit currently selfmanages and uses external investment managers to invest such cash margin and guaranty fund deposits 

we have an obligation to return margin payments and guaranty fund contributions to clearing members to the extent that the relevant member’s risk based on its open contracts to the clearing house is reduced if a number of clearing members substantially reduce their open interest or default the concentration of risks within our clearing houses will be spread among a smaller pool of clearing members which would make it more difficult to absorb and manage risk in the event of a further clearing member’s default 

although our clearing houses have policies and procedures to help ensure that clearing members can satisfy their obligations such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a members or counterparty’s default in addition although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards it is a complex process and there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect us from the risks of clearing these products we cannot assure you that these measures and safeguards will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default we have contributed our own capital to the front of the guaranty fund of the clearing houses that could be used in the event of a default furthermore in september 2019 we added a layer of insurance to our clearing member default protection the default insurance layer resides after and in addition to the ice clear credit ice clear europe and ice clear us skin in the game contributions and before the guaranty fund contributions of the nondefaulting clearing members the default insurance has a threeyear term subject to renewal notwithstanding these actions the default of any one of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and cause our customers to lose confidence in the guaranty of our clearing houses 

a decline in the value of securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions by our clearing houses or default by a sovereign government issuer could pose additional risks of default by clearing members 

our clearing houses hold a substantial amount of assets as margin or guaranty fund contributions which comprise us and other sovereign treasury securities as of december 31 2019  our clearing houses held 582 billion of noncash margin or guaranty fund contributions in us and other sovereign treasury securities 445 billion of this amount was comprised of us treasury securities 24 billion of french treasury securities 16 billion of german treasury securities 14 billion of uk treasury securities and 83 billion of other european japanese and triparty treasury securities sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest and most liquid securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived credit worthiness of major governments however the markets for such securities have experienced significant volatility during the past decade due to ongoing financial challenges in some of the major european countries and the us government’s negotiations regarding taxation spending cuts and raising the debt ceiling which is the maximum amount of debt that the us government can legally incur in addition if there is a collapse in a specific currency relied upon by our clearing houses our clearing houses would face significant expenses in changing 

their systems and such an event could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates to mitigate this risk our clearing houses currently apply a discount or “haircut” to the market values for all sovereign securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions however market conditions could change more quickly than we adjust the amount of the haircuts and the haircuts could be insufficient in the event of a sudden market event 

if the value of these securities declines significantly our clearing houses will need to collect additional margin or guaranty fund contributions from their clearing members which may be difficult for the members to supply in a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government if a clearing member cannot supply the additional margin or guaranty fund contributions which may include cash in a currency acceptable to the clearing house the clearing house would deem the clearing member in default if any clearing members default as a result of the reduction in the value of margin or guaranty fund contributions our clearing houses and trading business could suffer substantial losses as a result of the loss of any capital that has been contributed to the clearing house’s guaranty funds and a loss of confidence by clearing members in the clearing house resulting in a reduction in volumes of future cleared transactions 

further our clearing houses invest large sums through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions in the event that a reverse repo counterparty defaults the value of the sovereign securities we hold as collateral might not be sufficient to cover our losses our clearing houses may also make demand deposits with banks that are secured only to the value of fdic insurance or other national deposit guarantee schemes which is small and therefore the deposits may in significant part be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent 

owning and operating equity and options exchanges exposes us to additional risks including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject 

owning and operating equity and options exchanges for which the revenues are primarily derived from trading activity market data and listing fees exposes us to additional risks adverse economic conditions and regulatory changes similar to those discussed above including changes to the number of exchanges that are permitted to conduct closing auctions could result in decreased trading volume on our exchanges discourage market participants from listing on our equity and options exchanges or cause them to forgo new offerings any of these could reduce our revenues including market data revenue 

our exchanges are operated as forprofit businesses but have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled specifically our exchanges are responsible for enforcing listed company compliance with applicable listing standards overseeing regulatory policy determinations rule interpretation and regulationrelated rule development and conducting trading reviews any failure by one of our exchanges with selfregulatory responsibility to comply with and enforce compliance by their members with exchange rules and securities laws could significantly harm our reputation prompt regulatory scrutiny result in the payment of fines or penalties and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we must allocate significant resources to fulfill our selfregulatory responsibilities the forprofit exchanges’ goal of maximizing stockholder value might contradict the exchanges’ selfregulatory responsibilities in addition the listing of our common stock on the nyse could potentially create a conflict between the exchange’s regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities on the one hand and our commercial and economic interest on the other hand while we have structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful 

further changes in the rules and operations of our securities markets must be reviewed and approved by the sec approval of such changes by the sec cannot be guaranteed and the sec could delay either the approval process or the initiation of the public comment process any denial or delay in approving changes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we face intense competition 

we face intense competition in all aspects of our business and our competitors both domestic and international are numerous we currently compete with 



 trends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings finally many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and ats businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business some of our competitors may have greater capital and resources offer a wide range of products and services or operate under less stringent regulatory regimes than we do 

we also face pricing competition in many areas of our business a decline in our fees due to competitive pressure the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for example ice data services’ business has benefited from a high renewal rate in its subscriptionbased business but we cannot assure you that this will continue we also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings modify the pricing for our products or retain our current customers or attract new customers if we are not able to compete successfully our business could be materially impacted including our ability to remain as an operating entity 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we have achieved a tremendous amount of growth since becoming a public company in 2005 our growth is highly dependent on customer demand for our core products and services favorable economic conditions and our ability to invest in our personnel facilities infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls adverse economic conditions could reduce customer demand for our products and services which may place a significant strain on our management and resources and could force us to defer existing or future planned opportunities we regularly evaluate our existing operations service capacity and business efficiencies and as a result of such evaluations we may undertake strategic initiatives outside of and within our businesses in addition we may not be successful in executing on our strategies to support our growth organically or through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances 

regulatory changes or court rulings may have an adverse impact on our ability to derive revenue from market data and connectivity fees 

regulatory developments or court rulings could reduce the amount of revenue that we obtain from market data and connectivity fees with respect to our us equities and equity options exchanges our ability to assess fees for market data products and certain connectivity fees are subject to review by the sec there continues to be opposing industry viewpoints and litigation as to the extent that our us equities and equity options exchanges should be able to charge for market data and market access and the manner in which we set such exchange fees could be reassessed in october 2018 the sec issued an order setting aside certain market data fees imposed by nyse arca inc and nasdaq stock market llc that were challenged by the securities industry and financial markets association or sifma finding that the exchanges had not met their statutory obligation to demonstrate that the fees were consistent with the exchange act ie that these fees are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory simultaneously the sec remanded over 400 market data fee and other filings back to the exchanges and the national market system plans for consideration under the standards set out in the sifma order and an earlier order issued by the sec relating to a separate litigation matter 

if new constraints are placed on our ability to charge for market data or market access it could have a negative impact on our revenues we cannot predict whether or in what form any regulatory or other changes will take effect or their 

impact on our business a determination by the sec or a court for example that the sec must link market data fees to marginal costs take a more active role in the market data ratesetting process or reduce the current levels of market data fees could have an adverse effect on our market data revenues 

separately our european exchanges are currently authorized to sell trade information on a nondiscriminatory basis at a reasonable cost this regulatory position could be modified or interpreted by the ec or future european court decisions in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our european market data revenues 

failure to administer and evolve our benchmarks and indices in a manner that maintains the reliability and relevance of the benchmark or index damage to our reputation related to the administration of benchmarks and indices including libor and the potential replacement of and transition from benchmarks and indices including libor could adversely affect our business 

certain of our subsidiaries produce and license multiple global benchmarks and indices across asset classes and a significant portion of our trading and clearing volume references these benchmarks and indices to ensure continued trading and clearing in these benchmarkrelated products and the continued licensing and use of these benchmarks and indices our subsidiaries must be able to demonstrate that these benchmarks and indices are administered with integrity and are not readily subject to manipulation and must also continue to evolve these benchmarks and indices as necessary to maintain their reliability and relevance as an example our subsidiary iba is the administrator of various global benchmarks including libor iba assumed the administration of libor following various cases of attempted manipulation and misconduct related to the libor benchmark that emerged following the financial crisis any failures negative publicity or lawsuits related to our subsidiaries administration of benchmarks and indices including libor could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and indices and could harm our business and our reputation in 2019 ice and certain affiliates were named as defendants in three virtually identical proposed class action lawsuits regarding the administration of libor that allege that ice and certain affiliates along with 18 multinational banks engaged in a conspiracy to set the us dollar libor benchmark at artificially low levels ice and its affiliates intend to vigorously defend this action 

the replacement of or transition from our subsidiaries benchmarks and indices including libor or any other changes or reforms to the determination or administration of such benchmarks and indices could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results in july 2017 the fca stated its intention that it would no longer be necessary to sustain libor through its influence or legal powers beyond 2021 as such there is no guarantee that any libor settings will continue to be published after yearend 2021 alternative risk free reference rates have been selected for the various libor currencies by working groups in each relevant jurisdiction and global regulators have advocated for a transition from libor to these alternative rates by yearend 2021 in the us the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york or new york fed convened the alternative reference rates committee which selected the sofr as the alternative risk free rate for us dollars the new york fed started publishing sofr in april 2018 and developed a “paced transition plan” of key steps and milestones to encourage its adoption the transition from libor to alternative rates in the various libor currencies is at different stages and is proceeding at different speeds we continue to monitor industry and regulatory developments but it is not yet possible to predict with certainty how the transition from libor will be implemented whether recommendations and proposals from industry groups will be broadly accepted and what effect the transition from libor may have on the markets that use the benchmark today 

we may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities 

we intend to launch new products and services and continue to explore and pursue other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may spend substantial time and money developing new product offerings or improving current product offerings if these offerings are not successful we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to recover the costs of such initiatives obtaining any required regulatory approval associated with these offerings may also result in delays or restrictions on our ability to benefit fully from these offerings further we may seek to enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry introducing or maintaining our offerings in certain countries may also be subject to a number of other risks including currency exchange rate risk difficulties enforcing agreements or collecting receivables longer payment cycles compliance with the laws or regulations of these countries and political and regulatory uncertainties 

in addition in light of consolidation in the exchange data services and clearing sectors and competition for opportunities we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully our competitors could merge making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge 

with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors also offering new products and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives that are necessary for our success 

we have made substantial progress toward developing and deploying new technology platforms to improve our equity exchange business and data services business we may experience disruptions or encounter unexpected challenges in deploying these new systems further the costs to complete the remaining work may exceed our current expectations any significant cost increases or disruptions to product quality sales effectiveness or client service or to our other business operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences we may not be able to compete effectively 

our success depends on our ability to maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our technology to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary and acquired technology the financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change change in use patterns change in client preferences frequent product and service introductions and the emergence of new industry standards and practices these changes could render our existing proprietary technology uncompetitive or obsolete we have implemented a new trading technology system at nyse and if there are trading disruptions or if the new system has inadequate performance we could suffer material losses incur reputational damage or be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology to our clients’ requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and costeffective manner any failure to remain abreast of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to client preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our results 

our use of open source software could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services and subject us to litigation 

we use some opensource software in our technology most often as small components within a larger product or service to augment algorithms functionalities or libraries we create and we may use more opensource software in the future opensource code is also contained in some thirdparty software we rely on we could be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of the license for such opensource software the terms of many opensource licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us or other courts and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services further opensource licensors generally do not provide technology support maintenance warranties or assurance of title or controls on the origin of the software which can also lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software 

our business may be harmed by computer and communication systems failures and delays 

our business depends on the integrity reliability and security of our infrastructure which is highly dependent on our computer and communication systems we support and maintain many of the systems that comprise our electronic platforms and our failure to monitor or maintain these systems or to find replacements for defective components within a system in a timely and costeffective manner when necessary could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business our customers rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate and highquality financial market data analytics and related solutions our timely reliable delivery of highquality products and services is subject to an array of technical production processes that enable our delivery platforms to leverage an extensive range of content databases our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans including our ability to recover from the loss of one of our primary data centers may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach our systems or those of our thirdparty providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 



 we have experienced system failures in the past due to telecommunication failures and hardware and software malfunctions and defects and could experience in the future system failures due to power or telecommunications failures human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyberattacks intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar events these situations could result in damage to our business reputation and participant dissatisfaction with our electronic platform which could prompt participants to trade elsewhere or expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions as a consequence our business financial condition and operating results could suffer materially 

our regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in volume of order and trading transaction traffic and to provide processing and clearing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses could be adversely affected 

we currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or satisfy our debt service obligations 

as of december 31 2019  we had 78 billion of outstanding debt this level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt service obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our peers and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities as we use our available resources to reduce and refinance our consolidated debt our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue future business opportunities may be further restrained in addition the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio test and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other matters further a portion of our outstanding debt has been in commercial paper which is subject to interest rate changes rising interest rates will result in an increase in our interest expense we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could materially affect our financial condition 

our longterm and shortterm debt is currently rated by moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s these ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time and it is possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade our credit ratings in the future in particular our inability to sustain reduced debt on a consolidated basis may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings a significant downgrade of our credit ratings could impact customers’ willingness to use our clearing houses make parties less willing to do business with us and could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase the cost of our commercial paper and any future debt funding we may obtain 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

since we conduct operations in several different countries including the us uk eu and canada substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling euros and canadian dollars because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar 

against the other currencies may affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

external events such as brexit and the negotiations regarding the terms thereof and the passage of us taxation reform legislation have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially among the us dollar the british pound sterling and the euro if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the uk eu the us or other key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further the value of the pound sterling and euro and the global credit markets may further weaken general financial instability in countries in the eu could have a contagion effect on the region and contribute to the general instability and uncertainty in the eu events that adversely affect our uk and eu clients and suppliers could in turn have a materially adverse effect on our international business results and our operating results 

for additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk refer to “ foreign currency exchange rate risk” in item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk which is included in this annual report” 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill other intangible assets or investments 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2019  we had goodwill of  133 billion and net other intangible assets of  103 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties 

during 2019 we recorded an impairment charge of 31 million on the remaining value of our exchange registration intangible assets on ice futures singapore as a result of a decrease in fair value we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may result in asset impairments an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill other intangible assets and other investments and assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 

for additional information on our goodwill other intangible assets and investments refer to notes 3 4 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements and “ critical accounting policies  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets” in item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which are included in this annual report 

we may face liability for content contained in our data products and services 

we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation libel copyright or trademark infringement fraud or negligence or based on other theories of liability in each case relating to the data articles commentary ratings information or other content we distribute in our financial data services if such data or other content or information that we distribute has errors is delayed or has design defects we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our corporate website or those websites that we own and operate through links to other websites use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for significant amounts any such claim even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us could involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and a negative impact on our reputation 

in addition we license and redistribute data and content from various third parties and the terms of these licenses change frequently our thirdparty data and content suppliers may audit our use of and our clients’ use of and payment for data and content from time to time in the ordinary course of business including audits currently underway such thirdparty data and content suppliers may assert that we or our clients owe additional amounts under the terms of the applicable license agreements that we inappropriately distributed the thirdparty data or that we or our clients used the data or content in a manner that exceeded the scope of the applicable license agreement or without a license agreement we have and expect to continue to spend and allocate resources to develop and acquire the use of technology and other intellectual property rights to manage these risks and track thirdparty data usage but we cannot be assured that we will not incur liability we may incur costs to investigate any allegations and may be required to pay damages to or make unexpected settlement payments to these data and content suppliers and these costs and payments could be material 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties including trademarks service marks trade names trade secrets copyrights and patents we cannot assure you that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property additionally we may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively further we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights which may require significant financial and managerial resources as a result we may choose not to enforce our infringed intellectual property rights depending on our strategic evaluation and judgment regarding the best use of our resources the relative strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the recourse available to us 

in addition our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may have obtained and may be expected to obtain in the future patent and intellectual property rights related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents and intellectual property rights that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services as a result we may face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents and intellectual property rights held by others we may be subject to lawsuits or required to stop developing or marketing the products or services obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the holders of the patents and intellectual property or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patents we also could be required to pay damages if we were found to infringe patents held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we rely on thirdparty providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of an important service data or content supplied by any third party or the loss of an exclusive license could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as online service providers hosting service and software providers data processors software and hardware vendors banks local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading clearing data services and other systems we rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with third parties and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for the provision of hosting services we also depend on thirdparty suppliers for data and content including data received from certain competitors clients various government and public record services and financial institutions used in our products and services some of this data is exclusive to particular suppliers and may not be obtained from other suppliers in addition our data suppliers could enter into exclusive contracts with our competitors without our knowledge the general trend toward industry consolidation may increase the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future if these companies were to experience difficulties discontinue providing services to us for any reason or be unable to or fail to provide the type of service agreed to for any reason we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients or increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines our thirdparty data suppliers perform audits on us from time to time in the ordinary course of business to determine if data we license for redistribution has been properly accounted for in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreement as a result of these audits we may incur additional expenses 

many of our clients also rely on third parties to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform if these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients’ inability to transact with our businesses we hold exclusive licenses to list various index futures and contracts in the future litigation or regulatory action may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and contracts trading to a single exchange and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license mifid ii introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of services relating to commodity derivatives across europe and the legislation requires open access to any benchmarks a benchmark is an index or other measure used to determine the value of a financial instrument for example libor or the sp 500 used in europe if unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive 

license were permitted we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products 

we are subject to significant litigation and liability risks 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our participants involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred for example dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platform or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades abusive trading practices security and confidentiality breaches mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants in addition because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by entering them inaccurately a large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets 

in addition we are subject to ongoing legal disputes that could result in the payment of fines penalties or damages and could expose us to additional liability in the future for example in 2017 the us court of appeals for the second circuit or the second circuit issued a decision in city of providence v bats global markets et al a proposed class action case in which two of our subsidiaries new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca inc are defendants in vacating the district court’s dismissal of this lawsuit and remanding for further proceedings the second circuit concluded in part that the defendant securities exchanges are not immune from the claims in this case because absolute immunity is available to sros like the new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca inc only when they carry out regulatory functions although our exchanges will continue to have other defenses available to them in securities litigation cases including in this matter limitations on the doctrine of absolute immunity could result in an increased exposure to litigation and to increased liability andor other legal expenses additionally in early 2019 three virtually identical proposed class action lawsuits were filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york asserting that various ice entities including ice benchmark administration engaged in an alleged conspiracy with the libor panel banks to set the usd libor benchmark at artificially low levels for the alleged purpose and effect of depressing payments by those banks to persons who engaged in interest rate transactions with the banks from february 2014 to the present subsequently the plaintiffs refiled these claims as a consolidated amended complaint which ice and the other defendants have moved to dismiss while ice intends to vigorously defend these matters their outcome cannot be determined and adverse rulings could impact our financial condition and continued administration of the libor benchmark 

further we could incur significant expenses defending claims even those without merit which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us including those we are involved with due to acquisition activity may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we may have to establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for a summary of our legal proceedings and claims 

we may fail to complete or realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our acquisitions which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we have completed many acquisitions and plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to integrate these businesses into our existing operations and realize anticipated cost savings revenue synergies and growth opportunities we generally set aggressive timelines for realizing savings which assumes we successfully undertake a variety of actions including but not limited to integrating technology eliminating redundancies and effecting organizational restructurings that are themselves subject to a variety of risks and may be subject to regulatory approvals that we do not control the process of integrating acquired companies is time consuming and could disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties including inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants regulators and others require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of the business 

there is a risk however that we may not integrate these acquired companies in a manner that permits our expected cost savings and revenue synergies to be fully realized in the time periods expected or at all in addition a variety of factors 

including but not limited to regulatory conditions governmental competition approvals currency fluctuations and difficulty integrating technology platforms may adversely affect our ability to complete our acquisitions or realize our anticipated cost savings and synergies 

we may also not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures or alliances that we have entered into or may enter into for a number of reasons including regulatory or government approvals or changes global market changes contractual obligations competing products and in some instances our lack of or limited control over the management of the business further strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future 

as a result of any future acquisition we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest expend cash incur debt assume actual and contingent liabilities inherit existing or pending litigation or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets further we cannot assure you that any such financing or equity investments will be available with terms that will be favorable to us or available at all 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

given our prominence in the global securities industry and the location of many of our properties and personnel in us and european financial centers including lower manhattan we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees in addition terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets including trading on exchanges any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

damage to our reputation could damage our business 

our business is highly competitive and our customers typically have options on where to conduct their business our management team and business operations benefit from being highly regarded in our industry maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and for maintaining our relationships with our regulators negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services operations risk management compliance with regulations or management team could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our existing business and business prospects 

owning and operating voice broker and electronic fixed income brokerage businesses exposes us to additional risk and these businesses are largely dependent on general market conditions 

our voice broker business provides brokerage services to clients in the form of agency transactions in commodity products in agency transactions customers pay transaction fees for trade execution services in which we connect buyers and sellers who settle their transactions directly in connection with our fixed income business our brokerdealers operate in both an agency and in a matched principal capacity also known as “riskless principal” when trading as matched principal we agree to buy instruments from one customer and sell them to another customer the amount of the fee generally depends on the spread between the buy and sell price of the security that is brokered on our platforms with respect to matched principal transactions a counterparty to a matched principal transaction may fail to fulfill its obligations or we may face liability for an unmatched trade we also face the risk of not being able to collect transaction or subscription based fees for brokerage and related services that we provide to our customers 

our success largely depends on key personnel including our senior management and having adequate succession plans in place because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business the loss of senior management or other key personnel could harm our business 

our future performance depends in large part on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel including our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel competition for key personnel in the various localities and business segments in which we operate is intense our ability to attract and retain key personnel in particular senior management will be dependent on a number of factors including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent there is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who we rely upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives the loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel could harm our business in particular we may have to incur costs to replace senior officers or other key employees who leave and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner 

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders principal and interest on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock is dividends from our subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ice 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for ice these provisions make a change of control less likely which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of us and european equity exchanges for example our organizational documents include provisions that generally restrict any person either alone or together with its related persons from i voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10 of our outstanding voting capital stock including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock or ii beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock further our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to call special stockholders’ meetings or act by written consent and generally authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock in addition provisions of delaware law may have a similar effect such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders as defined under delaware law from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the board of directors 

risks to our business related to our investment in and operation of bakkt 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our majority investment in bakkt and the investment may introduce additional risks to our business due to its newly developed and evolving business model 

we have a majority ownership interest in bakkt holdings llc and by extension its subsidiaries collectively “bakkt” bakkt intends to create an integrated platform that enables consumers and institutions to transact in digital assets which include cryptocurrencies and other assets such as loyalty and rewards points in 2019 bakkt launched a custodial solution for bitcoin futures traded on ice futures us and other related trading products based on those futures in the future bakkt plans to launch additional products and services including a consumer platform that will enable consumers to buy sell store and spend digital assets due to our majority ownership interest in bakkt we have increased financial and reputational risks if there is a failure to launch one or more products or if the launch of a new product is unsuccessful also there can be no assurance that we will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or support from customers to launch products as planned that bakkt will operate as anticipated or that we will realize the expected return on our investment we regularly evaluate our existing operations service capacity and business efficiencies and as a result of 

such evaluations we may undertake strategic initiatives outside of and within our businesses as a result it may take longer than expected for us to realize the expected returns from this investment or such returns may ultimately be less than anticipated furthermore our investment in bakkt entails numerous risks including risks relating to bakkt’s ability to 

 as digital assets and blockchain technologies evolve bakkt may add modify or discontinue certain aspects of its business model relating to the product mix and service offerings future additions and modifications to bakkt’s business will increase the complexity of its business and place significant strain on our and bakkt’s management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we cannot offer any assurance that these or any other additions or modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to bakkt’s or our business 

distributed ledger technology is relatively new and we believe that the application of distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets is novel to the proposed bakkt systems and accordingly we have limited experience applying distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets the creation and operation of an exchange for the transfer of digital assets utilizing a distributed ledger to enable consumers and institutions to confirm that the blockchain underlying these digital assets has not been altered is subject to potential technical legal and regulatory constraints any problems that bakkt encounters with the operation of the bakkt systems including technical legal and regulatory problems could have a material adverse effect on its business and plan of operations 

hiring qualified and experienced personnel in this specialized technology space is difficult due to the high level of competition and scarcity of experience this could put a strain on existing ice employees and delay the work that these employees are performing for ice and ice’s subsidiaries in addition any potential issues or major decisions involving bakkt may divert the attention of management and resources from matters that are core or critical to ice’s business 

at present bakkt is heavily dependent on trading volume from bakkts bitcoin futures contract for its clearing and transaction fee revenues and profits failure to establish the trading volume in bakkts bitcoin futures contract or any subsequent products released by bakkt would negatively impact bakkts business financial condition and operating results and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

digital currency custodial solutions and related technology including bakkt’s systems and custodial arrangements are subject to risks related to a loss of funds due to theft of cryptocurrencies employee or vendor sabotage security and cybersecurity risks system failures and other operational issues and a lack of sufficient insurance which could cause damage to our reputation and brand and bakkt’s reputation and brand 

bakkts systems and custodial solutions involve the processing storage and transmission of cryptocurrencies and data while bakkt will contractually limit the amount of exposure it will have in the event that the cryptocurrencies are stolen or misappropriated we cannot guarantee that these limits will protect us from additional liability and other damage the theft or misappropriation of cryptocurrencies held in custody by bakkt would likely result in financial loss reputational damage potential lack of trust from our customers in other business lines negative press coverage and diversion of management’s time and focus the secure storage and transmission of cryptocurrencies and data over networks will be a critical element of bakkt’s operations despite the defensive measures bakkt may take these threats may come from external factors such as governments organized crime hackers and other third parties such as outsourced or infrastructuresupport providers and application developers or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom bakkt has granted access to its systems 

cryptocurrency transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies may be irretrievable once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain an incorrect transfer of a cryptocurrency generally will not be reversible and bakkt may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft it is possible that through computer or human error or through theft or criminal action the cryptocurrency could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties or to uncontrolled accounts such events would 

have a material adverse effect on the ability of bakkt to continue as a going concern which would have a material adverse effect on our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

while bakkt maintains insurance policies they may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches and bakkt may lose cryptocurrencies valued in excess of the insurance policy without any recourse unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions in the event of loss or loss of utility value there is no public insurer such as the securities investor protection corporation or the fdic to offer recourse to bakkt or to any investor and the misappropriated cryptocurrencies cannot easily be traced to the bad actor 

further when cryptocurrency custodial solutions or transfer venues whether involving bakkt systems or others experience system failures or other operational issues such events could result in a reduction in cryptocurrency prices or confidence and impact the success of bakkt and have a material adverse effect on the ability of bakkt to continue as a going concern 

as bakkt expands into its consumer business its business will involve the collection storage processing and transmission of customers’ personal data including financial information an increasing number of organizations including large merchants businesses technology companies and financial institutions as well as government institutions have disclosed breaches of their information security systems some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks including on their websites mobile applications and infrastructure 

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized improper or illegal access to bakkt’s systems its data or customers’ data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated may be difficult to detect quickly and may only be recognized or detected after they have been launched against a target due to the nature of the bakkt business and industry unauthorized parties have attempted and we expect they will continue to attempt to gain access to bakkt’s systems or facilities through various means including hacking into bakkt’s systems or facilities or those of its customers partners or vendors or attempting to fraudulently induce for example through spear phishing attacks its employees customers partners vendors or other users into disclosing user names passwords payment information or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access our systems certain efforts may be statesponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources making them even more sophisticated and difficult to defend against and detect numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persistent cyberattacks phishing and social engineering schemes could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data in our systems we believe that bakkt is a particularly attractive target for such attacks due to its industry name and brand recognition although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our data customer data systems personnel and facilities from data loss and other security breaches and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections there can be no assurance that these security measures will be sufficient 

bakkt’s information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches and unauthorized third parties may be able to access its customers’ personal or confidential information and other sensitive data that are stored on or accessible through those systems we may experience breaches of our security measures due to human error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities in either bakkt systems or authorized thirdparty systems that bakkt relies on cybersecurity threats to and incidents involving third parties who support our activities  particularly those with lesssophisticated defenses  could impact us despite the efforts we make to ensure their cyber resiliency 

bakkt expects to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches financial services regulators in various jurisdictions including the us have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud which could impose significant costs require us to change our business practices make it more difficult for new customers to join bakkt or reduce the ease of use of our products any of which could harm our business 

regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of our majority ownership interest in bakkt or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects bakkt’s business prospects or operations and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

as cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies with certain governments deeming them illegal and others allowing their use and trade ongoing and future regulatory actions may impact the ability of bakkt to continue to operate and such actions could affect the ability of bakkt to continue as a going concern which would have a material adverse effect on the business prospects or operations of bakkt and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

the cftc has designated bitcoin as a commodity and as such exchangetraded derivatives involving bitcoin are subject to the cftcs jurisdiction and enforcement powers although the cftc has suggested it is not particularly focused on pursuing such enforcement at this time and in fact there may be some limits on its ability to do so without a specific connection to commodities derivatives markets in the event that the cftc does pursue such enforcement and ultimately shuts down an exchange on which bakkt’s bitcoin futures contract is traded it may have a significant adverse impact on bakkts business and plan of operations and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

governments may in the future curtail or outlaw the acquisition use or redemption of cryptocurrencies ownership of holding or trading in cryptocurrencies may then be considered illegal and subject to sanction governments may also take regulatory action that may increase the cost andor subject cryptocurrency companies to additional regulation 

in addition as bakkt expands its business to new products and services it will come under the jurisdiction of additional regulators  both with respect to jurisdiction inside and outside the us and subject matter payments consumer protection and other areas any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws regulations or orders of any governmental authority including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws regulations or orders including those discussed in this risk factor may subject bakkt to significant fines penalties criminal and civil lawsuits forfeiture of significant assets and enforcement result in additional compliance and licensure requirements increase regulatory scrutiny of its business restrict bakkt’s operations and force bakkt to change its business practices make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements bakkt has implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that its employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations 

the characteristics of digital currency have been and may in the future continue to be exploited to facilitate illegal activity such as fraud money laundering tax evasion and ransomware scams if any of our customers do so or are alleged to have done so it could adversely affect us 

digital currencies and the digital currency industry are relatively new and in many cases lightly regulated or largely unregulated some types of digital currency have characteristics such as the speed with which digital currency transactions can be conducted the ability to conduct transactions without the involvement of regulated intermediaries the ability to engage in transactions across multiple jurisdictions the irreversible nature of certain digital currency transactions and encryption technology that anonymizes these transactions that make digital currency particularly susceptible to use in illegal activity such as fraud money laundering tax evasion and ransomware scams 

while we believe that bakkt’s risk management and compliance framework is reasonably designed to detect any such illicit activities we cannot ensure that we will be able to detect any such illegal activity in all instances because the speed irreversibility and anonymity of certain digital currency transactions make them more difficult to track fraudulent transactions may be more likely to occur bakkt may be specifically targeted by individuals seeking to conduct fraudulent transfers and it may be difficult or impossible for us to detect and avoid such transactions in certain circumstances 

bakkt is subject to antimoney laundering and counter terrorist financing laws and regulations globally including the usa patriot act as well as economic and trade sanctions programs including those imposed and administered by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control or ofac under ofac’s economic sanctions program bakkt is prohibited from financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies currently crimea cuba iran north korea and syria and with persons and entities included in ofac sanctions lists including its list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons currently iran sudan and syria have been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states bakkt is also subject to anticorruption laws and regulations globally including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act bakkt has implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that its employees or agents will not violate such laws and regulations a failure by bakkt or its employees or agents to comply with such laws and regulations and subsequent judgment or settlement against bakkt under these laws could subject bakkt to monetary penalties damages andor have a significant reputational impact

item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe could materially adversely affect us other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect us in the future if any of the risks discussed below actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected accordingly you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this annual report 

global economic political and financial market events or conditions may negatively impact our business 

adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment government shutdowns currency fluctuations interest rate changes geopolitical events climate change international trade disputes including the imposition of tariffs or other protectionist measures actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending and in turn impact our business if our customers reduce spending workforce trading activity or demand for financial data as a result of challenges in the prevailing economic markets our revenues could decline 

a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from market data fees and fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets our market databased revenues are largely subscriptionbased or recurring and are generated from a range of global financial and commodity markets including pricing and reference data exchange data analytics feeds index services desktops and connectivity solutions for our transactionbased revenues we derive a significant percentage from trading in global energy and agriculturalrelated futures and options contracts as well as equity transactions and global interest rate contracts the market data subscriptions and trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of spending or trading activity for any reason including 

 a reduction in our overall trading volume could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenues a reduction in trading volumes could also result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for our market data which would further reduce our overall revenue 

further nyse’s revenue increases when more companies are seeking access to public markets and on the nyse specifically a stagnation or a decline in the ipo market or issuers choosing to list on venues other than the nyse could have an adverse effect on our revenues 

the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the uks exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

in 2016 a majority of voters in the uk approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit brexit has created political and economic uncertainty and instability in the global markets including currency and credit markets particularly in the uk and eu in addition political and economic uncertainty surrounding the terms of brexit has in the past led to and the outcome of brexit could lead to certain macroeconomic conditions that adversely affect our business adverse macroeconomic consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates legal uncertainty potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate andor prohibitive laws and regulations may adversely affect both demand for our products and services and our ability to deliver our products and services into the eu the long term effects of brexit will depend in part on any agreements the uk makes or does not make to retain access to eu markets following a transitional period 

following the formation of a majority conservative government in december 2019 the uk withdrew from the eu on january 31 2020 the future relationship between the uk and the eu remains uncertain as the uk and the eu work through the transition period that provides time for them to negotiate the details of their future relationship the transition period is currently expected to end on december 31 2020 and if no agreement is reached the default scenario would be a “nodeal” brexit in the event of a nodeal brexit the uk will leave the eu with no agreements in place beyond any temporary arrangements that have or may be put in place by the eu or individual eu member states and the uk as part of nodeal contingency efforts and those conferred by mutual membership of the world trade organization given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what financial trade and legal implications the uk leaving the eu with no agreements in place would have and how such withdrawal would affect us a large portion of our operations are conducted in the uk as a result a nodeal brexit could restrict access to our services by persons located in the eu or make access more expensive which could adversely affect our operations and profitability 

our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to increased legislation and regulatory scrutiny and we face the risk of changes to our regulatory environment and business in the future 

we are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in many jurisdictions around the world and in particular in the us and the uk we face the risk of significant actions by regulatory and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments which may affect our business the activity of our market participants and our results among other things as a result of regulators and tax authorities enforcing existing laws and regulations we could be censured fined prohibited from pursuing certain acquisitions or engaging in some of our business activities subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities including fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory pricing restrictions also known as frand or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees including settlement payments interest payments and penalty payments in many cases our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions 

there is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could be imposed this could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients’ overall trading volume through our exchanges and demand for our market data and other services the us government in particular has indicated a goal of reforming many aspects of existing financial services regulations some areas identified as subject to potential change amendment or repeal include the doddfrank act and the authorities of the federal reserve and fsoc however it is unknown at this time the effect that such passage adoption or modification will have positively or negatively on our industry or on us 

there is also increasing public concern regarding data privacy and data protection and many jurisdictions have passed laws in this area such as the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions the laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us regulation of privacy and data protection often times require monitoring of and changes to our data practices in regard to the collection use disclosure storage transfer andor security of personal and sensitive information 

these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our stockholders and creditors for example the adoption and implementation of position limit rules in the us and the eu could have an impact on our commodities business if comparable trading venues in foreign jurisdictions are not subject to equivalent rules position limits became effective in the eu beginning january 2018 and in certain cases the position limits are either lower or higher than the limits in us equivalent contracts these divergent regulations may cause us to move products from one jurisdiction to another as a result of business risks and competitive challenges could significantly increase the regulatory compliance costs for our customers and could significantly impact trading activity which could have a negative impact on our business 

us and eu legal and regulatory developments in response to the global financial crisis in particular the doddfrank act emir emir 22 mifid ii and the bmr have significantly altered and propose to further alter the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability the enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes most likely to affect our businesses are position limit rules in the us and the eu nondiscriminatory access provisions of mifid ii interoperability and margin rules in emir enhanced regulatory capital liquidity and leverage rules in basel iii and capital requirements directive iv access rules under the bmr the nonharmonization of margin requirements implementation of a financial transaction tax access to our benchmarks and maintaining our exchanges’ abilities to operate as sros with related immunity for the discharge of their regulatory functions as the operator of global businesses the lack of harmonization in international financial reform efforts could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in multiple jurisdictions 

the doddfrank act established enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the fsoc ice clear credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the fsoc and as a result is subject to additional oversight by the cftc compliance with these requirements has resulted in and will continue to result in additional operating costs 

in 2016 the sec approved a plan to establish a marketwide consolidated audit trail or cat to improve regulators’ ability to monitor trading activity in 2018 the first phase of implementation went live and required sro participants to begin reporting to the cat due to delays in implementation and failure to implement required functionality there is an increased risk to sros which include us of regulatory action by the sec in addition to increased risk in connection with our regulatory obligations implementation of the cat could result in significant additional expenditures which may not be reimbursed funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the sros and brokerdealers to date however funding has been provided solely by the sros partly in exchange for promissory notes which increases the risk that sros including us will not be reimbursed for costs expended to date due to delays and failures in implementation and functionality by the original plan processor as well as recently published proposals by the sec for an amended timeline and implementation structure we recorded promissory note impairment charges of 16 million in 2019 we believe the risk that sros are not reimbursed has increased resulting in this impairment until the sec approves a funding model that shares the cost of the cat between the sros and brokerdealers the sros may continue to incur additional costs which may become significant and may not be reimbursed as of december 31 2019  we have accrued approximately 7 million as a receivable in connection with our portion of expenses related to the cat implementation 

we are subject to tax laws regulations rulings and audits in multiple us and nonus jurisdictions that could have a significant impact on our business and lead to additional expenditures for us or our customers for example there have been discussions in various jurisdictions around financial transaction or digital service tax frameworks implementation of any new or amended taxes or regulations could impact our global operations or trading volumes 

other enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations 

our compliance and risk management methods as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations might not be effective which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators 

our ability to comply with existing rules regulations and laws and changing rules regulations and laws largely depends on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel regulators periodically review our ability to selfregulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including selfregulatory standards in particular certain of our businesses associated with the nyse group are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations policies and procedures if we fail to comply with any of these obligations regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business 

our acquisitions expose us to new regulatory requirements for example as a result of our acquisition of interactive data we operate an secregistered investment adviser investment advisers are subject to significant regulatory obligations under the investment advisers act prior to this acquisition none of our businesses were registered under the investment advisers act compliance with the investment advisers act and other regulatory requirements gives rise to costs and expenses that may be material in addition our acquisition of the bondpoint ats in january 2018 and our acquisition of tmc bonds in july 2018 exposes us to increased exposure to regulatory scrutiny from the sec finra and msrb 

our regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders embargo future business activity or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses we have settled certain regulatory actions in the past including nyses settlement with the sec in march 2018 in which we agreed to pay a 14 million civil monetary penalty we continue to face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity of our business any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our financial condition operating results or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business further any settlement consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or regulatory agencies begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities finally the implementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to remain competitive and grow our business 

our business is subject to the impact of financial markets volatility including the prices and interest rates underlying our derivative products due to conditions that are beyond our control 

trading volume in our markets and products is largely driven by the degree of volatility  the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations  in prices and levels of the underlying commodities securities indices financial benchmarks or other instruments volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates opportunities for investment and speculative or arbitrage trading were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices or levels of the underlying commodities securities indices benchmarks or other instruments of our products we could experience lower trading volumes slower growth or declines in revenues 

factors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility and thus trading volumes include 

 any one or more of these factors which are beyond our control may reduce trading activity which could make our markets less attractive as a source of liquidity and in turn could further discourage existing and potential market participants and thus accelerate a decline in the level of trading activity and potentially related services such as data or clearing further lower market volatility could also result in more exchanges competing for trading volumes to maintain their growth if any of these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets could be jeopardized because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our current products and services decline for any reason we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues which would cause our net income to decline 

systems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry could negatively impact us 

highprofile system failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our business and result in a loss of confidence in our technology and our markets regulatory investigations fines and penalties and business activity slowdown or interruptions further regulators have imposed requirements for trading platforms that have been costly for us to implement and could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services in particular the sec’s regulation systems compliance and integrity or regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations subject portions of our securities and derivatives trading platforms and other technological systems related to our clearing houses trade repositories and the us sef to more extensive regulation and oversight ensuring our compliance with the requirements of regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations requires significant implementation costs as well as increased ongoing administrative expenses and burdens in addition any expansion of the ice systems that are determined to be in scope for regulation sci could result in significant additional expenditures 

our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cyberattacks hacking and other cybersecurity risks especially in light of our role in the global financial marketplace which could result in wrongful manipulation disclosure destruction or use of our information or that of a third party or which could make our participants unable or reluctant to use our electronic platforms 

the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to reliably transact on our electronic platforms and provide financial data services are critical elements of our operations some of our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential client and other data including client portfolio information if anyone gains improper access to our electronic platforms networks or databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify our confidential information or that of a third party breaches of our cybersecurity measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business our networks and those of our participants thirdparty service providers and external market infrastructures may be vulnerable to compromise unauthorized access security technology failure computer viruses social engineering denial of service attacks terrorism ransomware attacks firewall or encryption failures or other security problems resulting in loss of data integrity information disclosure unavailability or fraud the financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of political protest activism and financial gain and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for cyberattack and other information security threats further former employees of companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly 

although we have not been subject to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity events including distributed denial of service attacks malware infections phishing web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size for example we experienced a coordinated set of sophisticated distributed denial of service or ddos attacks in 2019 that activated our detection and response measures which mitigated the impact in response to these threats we also engaged our threat intelligence and risk assessment functions to perform rootcause analysis and continue to refine controls while we operate an information security program that is designed to prevent detect track and mitigate cyber incidents and that has detected and mitigated such incidents in the past we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against future attacks losses or reduced trading volume in our markets any such attacks could result in reputational damage cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose customers cause us to experience lower current and future trading volumes or incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive position in addition given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or disable or degrade systems a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected and we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely the extent of a particular cyber incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while such an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it which may compound damages before the incident is discovered or remediated additionally as threats continue to evolve and increase and as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous we may be required 

to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities which could adversely impact our net income 

further cybersecurity threats to and incidents involving vendors and other thirdparties who support our activities  particularly those with lesssophisticated defenses  could impact us during 2019 we became aware of three separate vendors who were materially impacted by significant ransomware attacks although we were able to shift reliance away from each of these vendors quickly these incidents demonstrate the potential for cybersecurity incidents of third parties to have a material impact despite the efforts we make to minimize concentration risk and ensure the cyber resiliency of our vendors 

owning clearing houses exposes us to risks including risks related to defaults by clearing members risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses 

there are risks inherent in operating clearing houses including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members market liquidity risks defaults by clearing members and risks associated with custody and investing margin or guaranty fund assets provided by clearing members to our clearing houses which could subject our business to substantial losses for example clearing members have transferred an aggregate amount of cash in ice clear europe relating to margin and guaranty funds of 325 billion as of december 31 2019 and a total of 650 billion for all of our clearing houses as of december 31 2019  the ice clearing houses may use thirdparty investment advisors for investment of cash assets subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house and may add or change the investment managers from time to time to the extent available ice clear credit holds the us dollar cash and us treasuries that clearing members transfer to satisfy their original margin and guaranty fund requirements at its account at the federal reserve with respect to other clearing member cash posted ice clear credit currently selfmanages and uses external investment managers to invest such cash margin and guaranty fund deposits 

we have an obligation to return margin payments and guaranty fund contributions to clearing members to the extent that the relevant member’s risk based on its open contracts to the clearing house is reduced if a number of clearing members substantially reduce their open interest or default the concentration of risks within our clearing houses will be spread among a smaller pool of clearing members which would make it more difficult to absorb and manage risk in the event of a further clearing member’s default 

although our clearing houses have policies and procedures to help ensure that clearing members can satisfy their obligations such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a members or counterparty’s default in addition although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards it is a complex process and there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect us from the risks of clearing these products we cannot assure you that these measures and safeguards will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default we have contributed our own capital to the front of the guaranty fund of the clearing houses that could be used in the event of a default furthermore in september 2019 we added a layer of insurance to our clearing member default protection the default insurance layer resides after and in addition to the ice clear credit ice clear europe and ice clear us skin in the game contributions and before the guaranty fund contributions of the nondefaulting clearing members the default insurance has a threeyear term subject to renewal notwithstanding these actions the default of any one of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and cause our customers to lose confidence in the guaranty of our clearing houses 

a decline in the value of securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions by our clearing houses or default by a sovereign government issuer could pose additional risks of default by clearing members 

our clearing houses hold a substantial amount of assets as margin or guaranty fund contributions which comprise us and other sovereign treasury securities as of december 31 2019  our clearing houses held 582 billion of noncash margin or guaranty fund contributions in us and other sovereign treasury securities 445 billion of this amount was comprised of us treasury securities 24 billion of french treasury securities 16 billion of german treasury securities 14 billion of uk treasury securities and 83 billion of other european japanese and triparty treasury securities sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest and most liquid securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived credit worthiness of major governments however the markets for such securities have experienced significant volatility during the past decade due to ongoing financial challenges in some of the major european countries and the us government’s negotiations regarding taxation spending cuts and raising the debt ceiling which is the maximum amount of debt that the us government can legally incur in addition if there is a collapse in a specific currency relied upon by our clearing houses our clearing houses would face significant expenses in changing 

their systems and such an event could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates to mitigate this risk our clearing houses currently apply a discount or “haircut” to the market values for all sovereign securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions however market conditions could change more quickly than we adjust the amount of the haircuts and the haircuts could be insufficient in the event of a sudden market event 

if the value of these securities declines significantly our clearing houses will need to collect additional margin or guaranty fund contributions from their clearing members which may be difficult for the members to supply in a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government if a clearing member cannot supply the additional margin or guaranty fund contributions which may include cash in a currency acceptable to the clearing house the clearing house would deem the clearing member in default if any clearing members default as a result of the reduction in the value of margin or guaranty fund contributions our clearing houses and trading business could suffer substantial losses as a result of the loss of any capital that has been contributed to the clearing house’s guaranty funds and a loss of confidence by clearing members in the clearing house resulting in a reduction in volumes of future cleared transactions 

further our clearing houses invest large sums through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions in the event that a reverse repo counterparty defaults the value of the sovereign securities we hold as collateral might not be sufficient to cover our losses our clearing houses may also make demand deposits with banks that are secured only to the value of fdic insurance or other national deposit guarantee schemes which is small and therefore the deposits may in significant part be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent 

owning and operating equity and options exchanges exposes us to additional risks including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject 

owning and operating equity and options exchanges for which the revenues are primarily derived from trading activity market data and listing fees exposes us to additional risks adverse economic conditions and regulatory changes similar to those discussed above including changes to the number of exchanges that are permitted to conduct closing auctions could result in decreased trading volume on our exchanges discourage market participants from listing on our equity and options exchanges or cause them to forgo new offerings any of these could reduce our revenues including market data revenue 

our exchanges are operated as forprofit businesses but have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled specifically our exchanges are responsible for enforcing listed company compliance with applicable listing standards overseeing regulatory policy determinations rule interpretation and regulationrelated rule development and conducting trading reviews any failure by one of our exchanges with selfregulatory responsibility to comply with and enforce compliance by their members with exchange rules and securities laws could significantly harm our reputation prompt regulatory scrutiny result in the payment of fines or penalties and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we must allocate significant resources to fulfill our selfregulatory responsibilities the forprofit exchanges’ goal of maximizing stockholder value might contradict the exchanges’ selfregulatory responsibilities in addition the listing of our common stock on the nyse could potentially create a conflict between the exchange’s regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities on the one hand and our commercial and economic interest on the other hand while we have structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful 

further changes in the rules and operations of our securities markets must be reviewed and approved by the sec approval of such changes by the sec cannot be guaranteed and the sec could delay either the approval process or the initiation of the public comment process any denial or delay in approving changes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we face intense competition 

we face intense competition in all aspects of our business and our competitors both domestic and international are numerous we currently compete with 



 trends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings finally many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and ats businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business some of our competitors may have greater capital and resources offer a wide range of products and services or operate under less stringent regulatory regimes than we do 

we also face pricing competition in many areas of our business a decline in our fees due to competitive pressure the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for example ice data services’ business has benefited from a high renewal rate in its subscriptionbased business but we cannot assure you that this will continue we also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings modify the pricing for our products or retain our current customers or attract new customers if we are not able to compete successfully our business could be materially impacted including our ability to remain as an operating entity 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we have achieved a tremendous amount of growth since becoming a public company in 2005 our growth is highly dependent on customer demand for our core products and services favorable economic conditions and our ability to invest in our personnel facilities infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls adverse economic conditions could reduce customer demand for our products and services which may place a significant strain on our management and resources and could force us to defer existing or future planned opportunities we regularly evaluate our existing operations service capacity and business efficiencies and as a result of such evaluations we may undertake strategic initiatives outside of and within our businesses in addition we may not be successful in executing on our strategies to support our growth organically or through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances 

regulatory changes or court rulings may have an adverse impact on our ability to derive revenue from market data and connectivity fees 

regulatory developments or court rulings could reduce the amount of revenue that we obtain from market data and connectivity fees with respect to our us equities and equity options exchanges our ability to assess fees for market data products and certain connectivity fees are subject to review by the sec there continues to be opposing industry viewpoints and litigation as to the extent that our us equities and equity options exchanges should be able to charge for market data and market access and the manner in which we set such exchange fees could be reassessed in october 2018 the sec issued an order setting aside certain market data fees imposed by nyse arca inc and nasdaq stock market llc that were challenged by the securities industry and financial markets association or sifma finding that the exchanges had not met their statutory obligation to demonstrate that the fees were consistent with the exchange act ie that these fees are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory simultaneously the sec remanded over 400 market data fee and other filings back to the exchanges and the national market system plans for consideration under the standards set out in the sifma order and an earlier order issued by the sec relating to a separate litigation matter 

if new constraints are placed on our ability to charge for market data or market access it could have a negative impact on our revenues we cannot predict whether or in what form any regulatory or other changes will take effect or their 

impact on our business a determination by the sec or a court for example that the sec must link market data fees to marginal costs take a more active role in the market data ratesetting process or reduce the current levels of market data fees could have an adverse effect on our market data revenues 

separately our european exchanges are currently authorized to sell trade information on a nondiscriminatory basis at a reasonable cost this regulatory position could be modified or interpreted by the ec or future european court decisions in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our european market data revenues 

failure to administer and evolve our benchmarks and indices in a manner that maintains the reliability and relevance of the benchmark or index damage to our reputation related to the administration of benchmarks and indices including libor and the potential replacement of and transition from benchmarks and indices including libor could adversely affect our business 

certain of our subsidiaries produce and license multiple global benchmarks and indices across asset classes and a significant portion of our trading and clearing volume references these benchmarks and indices to ensure continued trading and clearing in these benchmarkrelated products and the continued licensing and use of these benchmarks and indices our subsidiaries must be able to demonstrate that these benchmarks and indices are administered with integrity and are not readily subject to manipulation and must also continue to evolve these benchmarks and indices as necessary to maintain their reliability and relevance as an example our subsidiary iba is the administrator of various global benchmarks including libor iba assumed the administration of libor following various cases of attempted manipulation and misconduct related to the libor benchmark that emerged following the financial crisis any failures negative publicity or lawsuits related to our subsidiaries administration of benchmarks and indices including libor could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and indices and could harm our business and our reputation in 2019 ice and certain affiliates were named as defendants in three virtually identical proposed class action lawsuits regarding the administration of libor that allege that ice and certain affiliates along with 18 multinational banks engaged in a conspiracy to set the us dollar libor benchmark at artificially low levels ice and its affiliates intend to vigorously defend this action 

the replacement of or transition from our subsidiaries benchmarks and indices including libor or any other changes or reforms to the determination or administration of such benchmarks and indices could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results in july 2017 the fca stated its intention that it would no longer be necessary to sustain libor through its influence or legal powers beyond 2021 as such there is no guarantee that any libor settings will continue to be published after yearend 2021 alternative risk free reference rates have been selected for the various libor currencies by working groups in each relevant jurisdiction and global regulators have advocated for a transition from libor to these alternative rates by yearend 2021 in the us the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york or new york fed convened the alternative reference rates committee which selected the sofr as the alternative risk free rate for us dollars the new york fed started publishing sofr in april 2018 and developed a “paced transition plan” of key steps and milestones to encourage its adoption the transition from libor to alternative rates in the various libor currencies is at different stages and is proceeding at different speeds we continue to monitor industry and regulatory developments but it is not yet possible to predict with certainty how the transition from libor will be implemented whether recommendations and proposals from industry groups will be broadly accepted and what effect the transition from libor may have on the markets that use the benchmark today 

we may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities 

we intend to launch new products and services and continue to explore and pursue other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may spend substantial time and money developing new product offerings or improving current product offerings if these offerings are not successful we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to recover the costs of such initiatives obtaining any required regulatory approval associated with these offerings may also result in delays or restrictions on our ability to benefit fully from these offerings further we may seek to enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry introducing or maintaining our offerings in certain countries may also be subject to a number of other risks including currency exchange rate risk difficulties enforcing agreements or collecting receivables longer payment cycles compliance with the laws or regulations of these countries and political and regulatory uncertainties 

in addition in light of consolidation in the exchange data services and clearing sectors and competition for opportunities we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully our competitors could merge making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge 

with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors also offering new products and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives that are necessary for our success 

we have made substantial progress toward developing and deploying new technology platforms to improve our equity exchange business and data services business we may experience disruptions or encounter unexpected challenges in deploying these new systems further the costs to complete the remaining work may exceed our current expectations any significant cost increases or disruptions to product quality sales effectiveness or client service or to our other business operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences we may not be able to compete effectively 

our success depends on our ability to maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our technology to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary and acquired technology the financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change change in use patterns change in client preferences frequent product and service introductions and the emergence of new industry standards and practices these changes could render our existing proprietary technology uncompetitive or obsolete we have implemented a new trading technology system at nyse and if there are trading disruptions or if the new system has inadequate performance we could suffer material losses incur reputational damage or be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology to our clients’ requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and costeffective manner any failure to remain abreast of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to client preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our results 

our use of open source software could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services and subject us to litigation 

we use some opensource software in our technology most often as small components within a larger product or service to augment algorithms functionalities or libraries we create and we may use more opensource software in the future opensource code is also contained in some thirdparty software we rely on we could be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of the license for such opensource software the terms of many opensource licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us or other courts and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services further opensource licensors generally do not provide technology support maintenance warranties or assurance of title or controls on the origin of the software which can also lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software 

our business may be harmed by computer and communication systems failures and delays 

our business depends on the integrity reliability and security of our infrastructure which is highly dependent on our computer and communication systems we support and maintain many of the systems that comprise our electronic platforms and our failure to monitor or maintain these systems or to find replacements for defective components within a system in a timely and costeffective manner when necessary could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business our customers rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate and highquality financial market data analytics and related solutions our timely reliable delivery of highquality products and services is subject to an array of technical production processes that enable our delivery platforms to leverage an extensive range of content databases our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans including our ability to recover from the loss of one of our primary data centers may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach our systems or those of our thirdparty providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 



 we have experienced system failures in the past due to telecommunication failures and hardware and software malfunctions and defects and could experience in the future system failures due to power or telecommunications failures human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyberattacks intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar events these situations could result in damage to our business reputation and participant dissatisfaction with our electronic platform which could prompt participants to trade elsewhere or expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions as a consequence our business financial condition and operating results could suffer materially 

our regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in volume of order and trading transaction traffic and to provide processing and clearing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses could be adversely affected 

we currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or satisfy our debt service obligations 

as of december 31 2019  we had 78 billion of outstanding debt this level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt service obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our peers and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities as we use our available resources to reduce and refinance our consolidated debt our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue future business opportunities may be further restrained in addition the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio test and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other matters further a portion of our outstanding debt has been in commercial paper which is subject to interest rate changes rising interest rates will result in an increase in our interest expense we may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could materially affect our financial condition 

our longterm and shortterm debt is currently rated by moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s these ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time and it is possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade our credit ratings in the future in particular our inability to sustain reduced debt on a consolidated basis may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings a significant downgrade of our credit ratings could impact customers’ willingness to use our clearing houses make parties less willing to do business with us and could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase the cost of our commercial paper and any future debt funding we may obtain 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

since we conduct operations in several different countries including the us uk eu and canada substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling euros and canadian dollars because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar 

against the other currencies may affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

external events such as brexit and the negotiations regarding the terms thereof and the passage of us taxation reform legislation have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially among the us dollar the british pound sterling and the euro if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the uk eu the us or other key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further the value of the pound sterling and euro and the global credit markets may further weaken general financial instability in countries in the eu could have a contagion effect on the region and contribute to the general instability and uncertainty in the eu events that adversely affect our uk and eu clients and suppliers could in turn have a materially adverse effect on our international business results and our operating results 

for additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk refer to “ foreign currency exchange rate risk” in item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk which is included in this annual report” 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill other intangible assets or investments 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2019  we had goodwill of  133 billion and net other intangible assets of  103 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties 

during 2019 we recorded an impairment charge of 31 million on the remaining value of our exchange registration intangible assets on ice futures singapore as a result of a decrease in fair value we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may result in asset impairments an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill other intangible assets and other investments and assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 

for additional information on our goodwill other intangible assets and investments refer to notes 3 4 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements and “ critical accounting policies  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets” in item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which are included in this annual report 

we may face liability for content contained in our data products and services 

we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation libel copyright or trademark infringement fraud or negligence or based on other theories of liability in each case relating to the data articles commentary ratings information or other content we distribute in our financial data services if such data or other content or information that we distribute has errors is delayed or has design defects we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our corporate website or those websites that we own and operate through links to other websites use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for significant amounts any such claim even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us could involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and a negative impact on our reputation 

in addition we license and redistribute data and content from various third parties and the terms of these licenses change frequently our thirdparty data and content suppliers may audit our use of and our clients’ use of and payment for data and content from time to time in the ordinary course of business including audits currently underway such thirdparty data and content suppliers may assert that we or our clients owe additional amounts under the terms of the applicable license agreements that we inappropriately distributed the thirdparty data or that we or our clients used the data or content in a manner that exceeded the scope of the applicable license agreement or without a license agreement we have and expect to continue to spend and allocate resources to develop and acquire the use of technology and other intellectual property rights to manage these risks and track thirdparty data usage but we cannot be assured that we will not incur liability we may incur costs to investigate any allegations and may be required to pay damages to or make unexpected settlement payments to these data and content suppliers and these costs and payments could be material 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties including trademarks service marks trade names trade secrets copyrights and patents we cannot assure you that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property additionally we may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively further we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights which may require significant financial and managerial resources as a result we may choose not to enforce our infringed intellectual property rights depending on our strategic evaluation and judgment regarding the best use of our resources the relative strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the recourse available to us 

in addition our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may have obtained and may be expected to obtain in the future patent and intellectual property rights related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents and intellectual property rights that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services as a result we may face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents and intellectual property rights held by others we may be subject to lawsuits or required to stop developing or marketing the products or services obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the holders of the patents and intellectual property or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patents we also could be required to pay damages if we were found to infringe patents held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we rely on thirdparty providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of an important service data or content supplied by any third party or the loss of an exclusive license could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as online service providers hosting service and software providers data processors software and hardware vendors banks local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading clearing data services and other systems we rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with third parties and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for the provision of hosting services we also depend on thirdparty suppliers for data and content including data received from certain competitors clients various government and public record services and financial institutions used in our products and services some of this data is exclusive to particular suppliers and may not be obtained from other suppliers in addition our data suppliers could enter into exclusive contracts with our competitors without our knowledge the general trend toward industry consolidation may increase the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future if these companies were to experience difficulties discontinue providing services to us for any reason or be unable to or fail to provide the type of service agreed to for any reason we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients or increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines our thirdparty data suppliers perform audits on us from time to time in the ordinary course of business to determine if data we license for redistribution has been properly accounted for in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreement as a result of these audits we may incur additional expenses 

many of our clients also rely on third parties to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform if these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients’ inability to transact with our businesses we hold exclusive licenses to list various index futures and contracts in the future litigation or regulatory action may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and contracts trading to a single exchange and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license mifid ii introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of services relating to commodity derivatives across europe and the legislation requires open access to any benchmarks a benchmark is an index or other measure used to determine the value of a financial instrument for example libor or the sp 500 used in europe if unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive 

license were permitted we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products 

we are subject to significant litigation and liability risks 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our participants involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred for example dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platform or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades abusive trading practices security and confidentiality breaches mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants in addition because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by entering them inaccurately a large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets 

in addition we are subject to ongoing legal disputes that could result in the payment of fines penalties or damages and could expose us to additional liability in the future for example in 2017 the us court of appeals for the second circuit or the second circuit issued a decision in city of providence v bats global markets et al a proposed class action case in which two of our subsidiaries new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca inc are defendants in vacating the district court’s dismissal of this lawsuit and remanding for further proceedings the second circuit concluded in part that the defendant securities exchanges are not immune from the claims in this case because absolute immunity is available to sros like the new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca inc only when they carry out regulatory functions although our exchanges will continue to have other defenses available to them in securities litigation cases including in this matter limitations on the doctrine of absolute immunity could result in an increased exposure to litigation and to increased liability andor other legal expenses additionally in early 2019 three virtually identical proposed class action lawsuits were filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york asserting that various ice entities including ice benchmark administration engaged in an alleged conspiracy with the libor panel banks to set the usd libor benchmark at artificially low levels for the alleged purpose and effect of depressing payments by those banks to persons who engaged in interest rate transactions with the banks from february 2014 to the present subsequently the plaintiffs refiled these claims as a consolidated amended complaint which ice and the other defendants have moved to dismiss while ice intends to vigorously defend these matters their outcome cannot be determined and adverse rulings could impact our financial condition and continued administration of the libor benchmark 

further we could incur significant expenses defending claims even those without merit which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us including those we are involved with due to acquisition activity may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we may have to establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for a summary of our legal proceedings and claims 

we may fail to complete or realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our acquisitions which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we have completed many acquisitions and plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to integrate these businesses into our existing operations and realize anticipated cost savings revenue synergies and growth opportunities we generally set aggressive timelines for realizing savings which assumes we successfully undertake a variety of actions including but not limited to integrating technology eliminating redundancies and effecting organizational restructurings that are themselves subject to a variety of risks and may be subject to regulatory approvals that we do not control the process of integrating acquired companies is time consuming and could disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties including inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants regulators and others require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of the business 

there is a risk however that we may not integrate these acquired companies in a manner that permits our expected cost savings and revenue synergies to be fully realized in the time periods expected or at all in addition a variety of factors 

including but not limited to regulatory conditions governmental competition approvals currency fluctuations and difficulty integrating technology platforms may adversely affect our ability to complete our acquisitions or realize our anticipated cost savings and synergies 

we may also not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures or alliances that we have entered into or may enter into for a number of reasons including regulatory or government approvals or changes global market changes contractual obligations competing products and in some instances our lack of or limited control over the management of the business further strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future 

as a result of any future acquisition we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest expend cash incur debt assume actual and contingent liabilities inherit existing or pending litigation or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets further we cannot assure you that any such financing or equity investments will be available with terms that will be favorable to us or available at all 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

given our prominence in the global securities industry and the location of many of our properties and personnel in us and european financial centers including lower manhattan we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees in addition terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets including trading on exchanges any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

damage to our reputation could damage our business 

our business is highly competitive and our customers typically have options on where to conduct their business our management team and business operations benefit from being highly regarded in our industry maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and for maintaining our relationships with our regulators negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services operations risk management compliance with regulations or management team could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our existing business and business prospects 

owning and operating voice broker and electronic fixed income brokerage businesses exposes us to additional risk and these businesses are largely dependent on general market conditions 

our voice broker business provides brokerage services to clients in the form of agency transactions in commodity products in agency transactions customers pay transaction fees for trade execution services in which we connect buyers and sellers who settle their transactions directly in connection with our fixed income business our brokerdealers operate in both an agency and in a matched principal capacity also known as “riskless principal” when trading as matched principal we agree to buy instruments from one customer and sell them to another customer the amount of the fee generally depends on the spread between the buy and sell price of the security that is brokered on our platforms with respect to matched principal transactions a counterparty to a matched principal transaction may fail to fulfill its obligations or we may face liability for an unmatched trade we also face the risk of not being able to collect transaction or subscription based fees for brokerage and related services that we provide to our customers 

our success largely depends on key personnel including our senior management and having adequate succession plans in place because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business the loss of senior management or other key personnel could harm our business 

our future performance depends in large part on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel including our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel competition for key personnel in the various localities and business segments in which we operate is intense our ability to attract and retain key personnel in particular senior management will be dependent on a number of factors including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent there is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who we rely upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives the loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel could harm our business in particular we may have to incur costs to replace senior officers or other key employees who leave and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner 

effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders principal and interest on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock is dividends from our subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ice 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for ice these provisions make a change of control less likely which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of us and european equity exchanges for example our organizational documents include provisions that generally restrict any person either alone or together with its related persons from i voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10 of our outstanding voting capital stock including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock or ii beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock further our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to call special stockholders’ meetings or act by written consent and generally authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock in addition provisions of delaware law may have a similar effect such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders as defined under delaware law from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the board of directors 

risks to our business related to our investment in and operation of bakkt 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our majority investment in bakkt and the investment may introduce additional risks to our business due to its newly developed and evolving business model 

we have a majority ownership interest in bakkt holdings llc and by extension its subsidiaries collectively “bakkt” bakkt intends to create an integrated platform that enables consumers and institutions to transact in digital assets which include cryptocurrencies and other assets such as loyalty and rewards points in 2019 bakkt launched a custodial solution for bitcoin futures traded on ice futures us and other related trading products based on those futures in the future bakkt plans to launch additional products and services including a consumer platform that will enable consumers to buy sell store and spend digital assets due to our majority ownership interest in bakkt we have increased financial and reputational risks if there is a failure to launch one or more products or if the launch of a new product is unsuccessful also there can be no assurance that we will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or support from customers to launch products as planned that bakkt will operate as anticipated or that we will realize the expected return on our investment we regularly evaluate our existing operations service capacity and business efficiencies and as a result of 

such evaluations we may undertake strategic initiatives outside of and within our businesses as a result it may take longer than expected for us to realize the expected returns from this investment or such returns may ultimately be less than anticipated furthermore our investment in bakkt entails numerous risks including risks relating to bakkt’s ability to 

 as digital assets and blockchain technologies evolve bakkt may add modify or discontinue certain aspects of its business model relating to the product mix and service offerings future additions and modifications to bakkt’s business will increase the complexity of its business and place significant strain on our and bakkt’s management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we cannot offer any assurance that these or any other additions or modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to bakkt’s or our business 

distributed ledger technology is relatively new and we believe that the application of distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets is novel to the proposed bakkt systems and accordingly we have limited experience applying distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets the creation and operation of an exchange for the transfer of digital assets utilizing a distributed ledger to enable consumers and institutions to confirm that the blockchain underlying these digital assets has not been altered is subject to potential technical legal and regulatory constraints any problems that bakkt encounters with the operation of the bakkt systems including technical legal and regulatory problems could have a material adverse effect on its business and plan of operations 

hiring qualified and experienced personnel in this specialized technology space is difficult due to the high level of competition and scarcity of experience this could put a strain on existing ice employees and delay the work that these employees are performing for ice and ice’s subsidiaries in addition any potential issues or major decisions involving bakkt may divert the attention of management and resources from matters that are core or critical to ice’s business 

at present bakkt is heavily dependent on trading volume from bakkts bitcoin futures contract for its clearing and transaction fee revenues and profits failure to establish the trading volume in bakkts bitcoin futures contract or any subsequent products released by bakkt would negatively impact bakkts business financial condition and operating results and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

digital currency custodial solutions and related technology including bakkt’s systems and custodial arrangements are subject to risks related to a loss of funds due to theft of cryptocurrencies employee or vendor sabotage security and cybersecurity risks system failures and other operational issues and a lack of sufficient insurance which could cause damage to our reputation and brand and bakkt’s reputation and brand 

bakkts systems and custodial solutions involve the processing storage and transmission of cryptocurrencies and data while bakkt will contractually limit the amount of exposure it will have in the event that the cryptocurrencies are stolen or misappropriated we cannot guarantee that these limits will protect us from additional liability and other damage the theft or misappropriation of cryptocurrencies held in custody by bakkt would likely result in financial loss reputational damage potential lack of trust from our customers in other business lines negative press coverage and diversion of management’s time and focus the secure storage and transmission of cryptocurrencies and data over networks will be a critical element of bakkt’s operations despite the defensive measures bakkt may take these threats may come from external factors such as governments organized crime hackers and other third parties such as outsourced or infrastructuresupport providers and application developers or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom bakkt has granted access to its systems 

cryptocurrency transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies may be irretrievable once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain an incorrect transfer of a cryptocurrency generally will not be reversible and bakkt may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft it is possible that through computer or human error or through theft or criminal action the cryptocurrency could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties or to uncontrolled accounts such events would 

have a material adverse effect on the ability of bakkt to continue as a going concern which would have a material adverse effect on our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

while bakkt maintains insurance policies they may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches and bakkt may lose cryptocurrencies valued in excess of the insurance policy without any recourse unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions in the event of loss or loss of utility value there is no public insurer such as the securities investor protection corporation or the fdic to offer recourse to bakkt or to any investor and the misappropriated cryptocurrencies cannot easily be traced to the bad actor 

further when cryptocurrency custodial solutions or transfer venues whether involving bakkt systems or others experience system failures or other operational issues such events could result in a reduction in cryptocurrency prices or confidence and impact the success of bakkt and have a material adverse effect on the ability of bakkt to continue as a going concern 

as bakkt expands into its consumer business its business will involve the collection storage processing and transmission of customers’ personal data including financial information an increasing number of organizations including large merchants businesses technology companies and financial institutions as well as government institutions have disclosed breaches of their information security systems some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks including on their websites mobile applications and infrastructure 

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized improper or illegal access to bakkt’s systems its data or customers’ data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated may be difficult to detect quickly and may only be recognized or detected after they have been launched against a target due to the nature of the bakkt business and industry unauthorized parties have attempted and we expect they will continue to attempt to gain access to bakkt’s systems or facilities through various means including hacking into bakkt’s systems or facilities or those of its customers partners or vendors or attempting to fraudulently induce for example through spear phishing attacks its employees customers partners vendors or other users into disclosing user names passwords payment information or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access our systems certain efforts may be statesponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources making them even more sophisticated and difficult to defend against and detect numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persistent cyberattacks phishing and social engineering schemes could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data in our systems we believe that bakkt is a particularly attractive target for such attacks due to its industry name and brand recognition although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our data customer data systems personnel and facilities from data loss and other security breaches and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections there can be no assurance that these security measures will be sufficient 

bakkt’s information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches and unauthorized third parties may be able to access its customers’ personal or confidential information and other sensitive data that are stored on or accessible through those systems we may experience breaches of our security measures due to human error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities in either bakkt systems or authorized thirdparty systems that bakkt relies on cybersecurity threats to and incidents involving third parties who support our activities  particularly those with lesssophisticated defenses  could impact us despite the efforts we make to ensure their cyber resiliency 

bakkt expects to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches financial services regulators in various jurisdictions including the us have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud which could impose significant costs require us to change our business practices make it more difficult for new customers to join bakkt or reduce the ease of use of our products any of which could harm our business 

regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of our majority ownership interest in bakkt or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects bakkt’s business prospects or operations and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

as cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies with certain governments deeming them illegal and others allowing their use and trade ongoing and future regulatory actions may impact the ability of bakkt to continue to operate and such actions could affect the ability of bakkt to continue as a going concern which would have a material adverse effect on the business prospects or operations of bakkt and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

the cftc has designated bitcoin as a commodity and as such exchangetraded derivatives involving bitcoin are subject to the cftcs jurisdiction and enforcement powers although the cftc has suggested it is not particularly focused on pursuing such enforcement at this time and in fact there may be some limits on its ability to do so without a specific connection to commodities derivatives markets in the event that the cftc does pursue such enforcement and ultimately shuts down an exchange on which bakkt’s bitcoin futures contract is traded it may have a significant adverse impact on bakkts business and plan of operations and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

governments may in the future curtail or outlaw the acquisition use or redemption of cryptocurrencies ownership of holding or trading in cryptocurrencies may then be considered illegal and subject to sanction governments may also take regulatory action that may increase the cost andor subject cryptocurrency companies to additional regulation 

in addition as bakkt expands its business to new products and services it will come under the jurisdiction of additional regulators  both with respect to jurisdiction inside and outside the us and subject matter payments consumer protection and other areas any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws regulations or orders of any governmental authority including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws regulations or orders including those discussed in this risk factor may subject bakkt to significant fines penalties criminal and civil lawsuits forfeiture of significant assets and enforcement result in additional compliance and licensure requirements increase regulatory scrutiny of its business restrict bakkt’s operations and force bakkt to change its business practices make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements bakkt has implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that its employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations 

the characteristics of digital currency have been and may in the future continue to be exploited to facilitate illegal activity such as fraud money laundering tax evasion and ransomware scams if any of our customers do so or are alleged to have done so it could adversely affect us 

digital currencies and the digital currency industry are relatively new and in many cases lightly regulated or largely unregulated some types of digital currency have characteristics such as the speed with which digital currency transactions can be conducted the ability to conduct transactions without the involvement of regulated intermediaries the ability to engage in transactions across multiple jurisdictions the irreversible nature of certain digital currency transactions and encryption technology that anonymizes these transactions that make digital currency particularly susceptible to use in illegal activity such as fraud money laundering tax evasion and ransomware scams 

while we believe that bakkt’s risk management and compliance framework is reasonably designed to detect any such illicit activities we cannot ensure that we will be able to detect any such illegal activity in all instances because the speed irreversibility and anonymity of certain digital currency transactions make them more difficult to track fraudulent transactions may be more likely to occur bakkt may be specifically targeted by individuals seeking to conduct fraudulent transfers and it may be difficult or impossible for us to detect and avoid such transactions in certain circumstances 

bakkt is subject to antimoney laundering and counter terrorist financing laws and regulations globally including the usa patriot act as well as economic and trade sanctions programs including those imposed and administered by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control or ofac under ofac’s economic sanctions program bakkt is prohibited from financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies currently crimea cuba iran north korea and syria and with persons and entities included in ofac sanctions lists including its list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons currently iran sudan and syria have been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states bakkt is also subject to anticorruption laws and regulations globally including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act bakkt has implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that its employees or agents will not violate such laws and regulations a failure by bakkt or its employees or agents to comply with such laws and regulations and subsequent judgment or settlement against bakkt under these laws could subject bakkt to monetary penalties damages andor have a significant reputational impact

 business environment and market trends 

our business environment has been characterized by 

 recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets centralized clearing and access to data all of which are important aspects of our product offering however some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered in addition some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several nonus regulations are inconsistent with us rules as the evolution continues legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data as a result it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us as discussed more fully in item 1 “ business  regulation” included in this annual report brexit the implementation of mifid ii and other regulations may result in operational regulatory andor business risk 

we have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class in addition we have increased our portion of nontransaction and clearing revenues from 34 in 2014 to 51 in 2019 this nontransaction revenue includes data services and listings 

we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in our proprietary ice global network and cybersecurity protections to minimize the potential impact of a widescale cyber interruption system outages or global regulatory drive to 

move critical infrastructure andor sensitive financial transactions away from the public internet we believe that our current and historic investments in this space position us well competitively to accommodate increased costs of compliance assurance or incident response however trends in nationalism and data privacy could result in requirements that necessitate increases in staffing or the introduction of local data collection and such requirements could undermine our synergistic centralized service model further a prolonged and impactful cyberattack on any of our market participants could drive the industry away from electronification and reduce the market advantages we have realized through automation 

many of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels we anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends including the following 

 we continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams and prudently manage expenses in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data clearing and markets 

segment results 

our business is conducted through two reportable business segments 

 while revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of both segments we use a prorata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment further we did not allocate expenses to specific revenue streams within these segments since such an allocation is not reasonably possible our two segments do not engage in intersegment transactions for details on trends in recent prior year periods refer to our 2018 and 2017 annual reports on form 10k 

trading and clearing segment 

the following presents selected statements of income data for our trading and clearing segment dollars in millions 

1 the adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance as a result these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with us gaap see “ nongaap financial measures” below 



transaction and clearing revenues 

our transaction and clearing revenues are reported on a net basis except for the nyse transactionbased expenses discussed below and consist of fees collected from our derivatives fixed income cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing rates percontract or rpc are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract net of certain rebates our percontract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors including but not limited to market conditions transaction and clearing volume product mix pricing applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements and new product introductions because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a percontract basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and due to product mix 

in 2019 and 2018  19 and 20 respectively of our trading and clearing segment revenues less transactionbased expenses were billed in pounds sterling or euros due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the 

us dollar our trading and clearing segment revenues less transactionbased expenses were lower by 25 million in 2019 from 2018  

our transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates we recorded rebates of 860 million and 844 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded the increase in the rebates is due primarily to increased volumes in products with higher rates per contract an increase in the number of rebate programs offered and an increase in the number of participants within our energy futures and options programs 

 cds clearing revenues were 132 million and 139 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively the notional value of cds cleared was 147 trillion and 164 trillion in 2019 and 2018  respectively cds clearing revenues decreased in 2019 from 2018 due to lower market volatility partially offset by record buyside participation at our us cds clearing house ice clear credit in terms of number of participants and single name notional cleared 

 

other revenues 

other revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits regulatory penalties and fines fees for use of our facilities regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our us securities exchanges designated market maker service fees technology development fees exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees the increase in other revenues in 2019 from 2018 is primarily due to increased interest income earned on certain clearing margin deposits reflecting higher balances and increased interest rates as well as due to the acquisition of simplifile 

selected operating data 

the following charts and tables present trading activity in our futures and options markets by commodity type based on the total number of contracts traded as well as futures and options rate per contract in millions except for percentages and rate per contract amounts 



open interest is the aggregate number of contracts long or short that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently “open” – in other words contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade exercise expiration or assignment open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange the following charts and table present our yearend open interest for our futures and options contracts in thousands except for percentages 



  

the following charts and tables present selected cash and equity options trading data all trading volume below is presented as average net daily trading volume or adv and is single counted 



handled volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities etfs and crossing session activity internally matched on our exchanges or routed to and executed on an external market center matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities etfs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges 

transactionbased expenses 

our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue these section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government’s costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals and are subject to change we in turn collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced the activity assessment fees are designed to equal the section 31 fees as a result activity assessment fees and the corresponding section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income although the timing of payment by us may vary from collections section 31 fees were 379 million and 357 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively the fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the sec semiannually as required the total amount is included in accrued liabilities and was 138 million as of december 31 2019  

we make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers as well as routing charges made to other exchanges which are included in transactionbased expenses we incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges in that case we route the customer’s order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer the external market center charges us a fee per share denominated in tenths of a cent per share for routing to its system we record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue cash liquidity payments routing and clearing fees were 966 million and 940 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively 

operating expenses operating income and operating margin 

the following chart summarizes our trading and clearing segments operating expenses operating income and operating margin dollars in millions see “ consolidated operating expenses” below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses 



1 the adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with gaap see “ nongaap financial measures” below 

data and listings segment 

the following charts and table present our selected statements of income data for our data and listings segment dollars in millions 

1 the adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance as a result these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with us gaap see “ nongaap financial measures” below 



our data and listings segment represents largely subscriptionbased or recurring revenues from data services and listings services offered across our trading and clearing businesses and ice data services through ice data services we generate revenues from a range of global financial and commodity markets including pricing and reference data exchange data analytics feeds index services desktops and connectivity solutions through nyse nyse american and nyse arca we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and etfs and related corporate actions for listed companies 

in 2019 and 2018  7 and 8 respectively of our data and listings segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros all relating to our data services revenues as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes the us equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly due to the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro during 2019  our data services revenues were lower by 9 million in 2019 than in 2018  

data services revenues 

our data services revenues are primarily subscriptionbased and increased 5 in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to the strong retention rate of existing customers the addition of new customers increased purchases by existing customers and increases in pricing of our products 

 annual subscription value or asv represents at a point in time the data services revenues subscribed for the succeeding 12 months asv does not include new sales contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12month period asv also does not include certain data services revenue streams that are not subscriptionbased revenue from asv businesses has historically represented approximately 90 of our data revenues thus while it is an indicative forwardlooking metric it does not provide a growth forecast of the next 12 months of data services revenues 

as of december 31 2019  asv was 2014 billion which increased 55 compared to the asv as of december 31 2018  this does not adjust for yearoveryear foreign exchange fluctuations or impacts of acquisitions 

listings revenues 

listings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges– original listing fees and annual listing fees original listing fees consist of two components initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions initial listing fees subject to a minimum and maximum amount are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists all listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period these services are provided with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges 

in addition we earn corporate actionsrelated listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares such as stock splits rights issues and sales of additional securities as well as mergers and acquisitions listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges 

in 2019 nyse and nyse american raised the most capital globally with approximately 112 billion raised in ipos and followon offerings from over 300 transactions 

operating expenses operating income and operating margin 

the following chart summarizes our data and listings segments operating expenses operating income and operating margin dollars in millions see “ consolidated operating expenses” below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses 



1 the adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with gaap see “ nongaap financial measures” below 

consolidated operating expenses 

the following presents our consolidated operating expenses dollars in millions 



the majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues except for certain technology and communication expenses including data acquisition costs licensing and other feerelated arrangements and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance 

we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with the growth of our business and to vary from yeartoyear based on the type and level of our acquisitions our integrations and other investments 

in 2019 and 2018  12 and 13  respectively of our operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros due to fluctuations in the us dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro our consolidated operating expenses were 14 million lower in 2019 than in 2018  see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk” below for additional information 

compensation and benefits expenses 

compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes noncapitalized employee wages bonuses noncash or stock compensation certain severance costs benefits and employer taxes the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and individual employee performance the performancebased restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance therefore our compensation and benefits expense will vary yeartoyear based on our financial performance and fluctuations in our number of employees the below chart summarizes the significant drivers of our compensation and benefits expense results for the periods presented dollars in millions except employee headcount 



employee headcount and compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2019 from 2018 primarily due the acquisitions of simplifile in 2019 and chx holdings inc the parent company of the chicago stock exchange or chx tmc bonds and mers in 2018 and the 2018 launch of bakkt employee headcount also increased due to new employees in our ice india office who had previously been our contractors during the three months ended december 31 2019 these new businesses resulted in additional compensation and benefits expense of 57 million in 2019 from 2018 stockbased compensation expenses in the table above relate to employee stock option and restricted stock awards 

professional services expenses 

professional services expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives temporary labor as well as regulatory legal and accounting fees and may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services temporary labor and regulatory accounting and legal proceedings 

professional services expenses decreased in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to lower consulting service fees on regulatory accounting technology and reference data services this was partially offset by higher legal fees associated with regulatory matters litigation matters and consulting work related to strategic initiatives 

acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs 

in 2019 we incurred 2 million in acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs primarily related to professional services costs from our 2019 acquisition of simplifile and other strategic opportunities 

in 2018 we incurred 34 million in acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs primarily relating to employee terminations and lease terminations in connection with our integrations of interactive data securities evaluations and credit market analysis professional services costs from our 2018 acquisitions and a 5 million banker success fee in connection with our acquisition of tmc bonds the integration of interactive data was completed by june 30 2018 

we expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth as a result we may incur acquisitionrelated transaction costs in future periods 

technology and communication expenses 

technology support services consist of costs for running our whollyowned data centers hosting costs paid to thirdparty data centers and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity these costs are driven by system capacity functionality and redundancy requirements communication expenses consist of costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and telecommunications costs 

technology and communications expense also includes fees paid for access to external market data licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume our capacity requirements changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly beginning in the second quarter of 2019 we have reflected amounts owed under certain thirdparty revenue share arrangements as technology and communication operating expenses rather than as had been previously recorded net within transaction and clearing revenues which resulted in an increase in technology and communications expense of 37 million in 2019 from 2018 

total technology and communications expenses also increased in 2019 from 2018 due to 16 million in costs related to our acquisitions of chx tmc bonds and mers in 2018 and simplifile in 2019 and our launch of bakkt the increase in 2019 was offset by additional costs related to data migrations hardware support upgrades and cybersecurity investments of 17 million in 2018 

rent and occupancy expenses 

rent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent maintenance real estate taxes utilities and other related costs we have significant operations located in and around atlanta new york and london with smaller offices located throughout the world see item 2 “ properties” above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses include marketing advertising public relations insurance bank service charges dues and subscriptions travel and entertainment nonincome taxes and other general and administrative costs selling general and administrative expenses increased in 2019 from 2018  primarily due to 5 million in costs related to our 2018 acquisitions of chx tmc bonds and mers our 2019 acquisition of simplifile and our launch of bakkt and increased travel and entertainment and other general and administrative costs partially offset by the release of nonincome tax reserves 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of longlived assets such as buildings leasehold improvements aircraft hardware and networking equipment software furniture fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses as well as on various licensing agreements over their estimated useful lives intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships trading products with finite lives and technology this expense also includes amortization of internallydeveloped and purchased software over its estimated useful life 

we recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions as well as on other intangible assets of 311 million and 289 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively amortization expense increased in 2019 from 2018 as a result of chx tmc bonds and mers intangible assets and the 31 million impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets on ice futures singapore partially offset by the 2018 4 million impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets related to our closure of ice futures canada and ice clear canada 

we recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of 320 million and 293 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively the increase in 2019 over 2018 was primarily due to depreciation resulting from increased software development and networking equipment 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating the following tables present our nonoperating income expenses dollars in millions 



interest income 

interest income increased in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to a rise in shortterm interest rates on various investments as well as higher cash and restricted cash balances at ice clear europe related to our guaranty fund contributions and increased regulatory capital 

interest expense 

interest expense increased in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to an increase in the principal and coupon of our bond refinancing in august 2018 as well as a rise in shortterm interest rates impacting our commercial paper program see “ debt” below 

other income net 

in connection with our equity investment in euroclear we recognized dividend income of 19 million and 15 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively which is included in other income 

in september 2019 we recorded promissory note impairment charges of 16 million on work performed by the original plan processor on the cat due to delays and failures in implementation and functionality by the original plan processor as well as recentlypublished proposals by the sec for an amended timeline and implementation structure we believe the risk that execution venues are not reimbursed has increased resulting in this impairment 

our equity method investments include the options clearing corporation or occ and prior to purchasing the remaining minority stake in mers in october 2018 our majority investment in mers we recognized 62 million and 46 million in equity income as other income related to these investments during 2019 and 2018  respectively 

prior to october 2018 we owned a majority stake in mers and treated it as an equity method investment because we did not have the ability to control its operations on october 3 2018 we completed the purchase of all remaining interests of mers and recognized a 110 million gain on our initial investment value as other income 

we own a 40 interest in the occ which is regulated by the sec and the cftc on february 13 2019 the sec disapproved the occ capital plan that was established in 2015 following the sec disapproval the occ also announced that it will not be providing a refund to clearing members or declaring a dividend to shareholders for the year ended december 31 2018 which resulted in higher reported occ 2018 net income than we had estimated during 2019 we recognized 62 million of equity earnings as our share of estimated occ profits including 19 million related to 2018 earnings which was recognized during 2019 refer to note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional details on our occ investment 

in connection with our adoption of accounting standards update or asu 201707 compensation retirement benefits improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost  or asu 201707 we are recognizing the other components of net benefit cost of our defined benefit plans in the income statement as nonoperating income on a full retrospective basis the combined net periodic expense of these plans was 4 million and 8 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively 

we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of 5 million and 2 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively this was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar foreign currency transaction gains 

and losses are recorded in other income net when the settlement of foreign currency assets liabilities and payables that occur in nonfunctional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the periodend foreign currency exchange rates between periods see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk” included elsewhere in this annual report for more information on these items 

noncontrolling interest 

for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100 and for which we have control over the assets liabilities and management of the entity the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as noncontrolling interests as of december 31 2019  our noncontrolling interests include those related to the nonice limited partners in our cds clearing subsidiaries and the redeemable noncontrolling interests of the nonice partners in bakkt 

during september 2018 we purchased a 32 interest in a nonice limited partner of our cds clearing subsidiaries and the remaining nonice limited partners hold a 267 ownership interest as of december 31 2019  refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 

in december 2018 bakkt holdings llc or bakkt was capitalized with 183 million in initial funding with ice as the majority owner along with a group of other minority investors we hold a call option over these interests subject to certain terms similarly the nonice partners in bakkt hold a put option to require us to repurchase their interests subject to certain terms these minority interests are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests in temporary equity within our consolidated balance sheet 

consolidated income tax provision 

consolidated income tax expense was 521 million and 500 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively the change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pretax income and the changes in our effective tax rate our effective tax rate was 21 and 20 in 2019 and 2018  respectively 

the 2019 effective tax rate is higher than the 2018 effective tax rate primarily due to the 2018 discrete tax benefits from the acquisition of mers and the divestiture of trayport exceeding the net increased tax benefits recorded in 2019 from certain international tax provisions under the tcja 

on december 22 2017 the tcja was signed into law the tcja enacted broad changes to the us federal income tax code including reducing the federal corporation income tax rate from 35 to 21 the reductions in us corporate income tax rates resulted in deferred tax benefits in the period of enactment the impact of the deferred tax benefits lowered the 2017 effective tax rate by 30 and resulted in a deferred tax benefit of 764 million 

see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included in this annual report for additional information on these tax items 

quarterly results of operations 

the following quarterly unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income data has been prepared on substantially the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations for the quarters presented the historical results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for any future period this unaudited condensed consolidated quarterly data should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report the following table sets forth quarterly consolidated statements of income data in millions 



1 other income expense net for the three months ended december 31 2018 includes a 110 million gain in connection with our acquisition of mers 

liquidity and capital resources 

below are charts that reflect our capital allocation the acquisition and integration costs in the chart below includes cash paid for acquisitions net of cash received for divestitures cash paid for equity investments cash paid for noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest and acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs in each year 

we have financed our operations growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures working capital strategic acquisitions and investments stock repurchases dividends and the development of our technology platforms we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt but we may also need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities in the future see “ future capital requirements” below 

see “ recent developments” above for a discussion of the acquisitions that we made during 2019  these acquisitions were funded from borrowing under our commercial paper program along with cash flows from operations 

our commercial paper program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable shortterm interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to delever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities we had net issuances of 360 million under our commercial paper program during 2019  

upon maturity of our commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper to mitigate this risk we maintain an undrawn backstop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount which meets or exceeds the amount issued under our commercial paper program at any time if we were not able to issue new commercial paper we have the option of drawing on the backstop revolving facility however electing to do so would result in higher interest expense for a discussion of our commercial paper program and other indebtedness see “ debt” below 

consolidated cash and cash equivalents were 841 million and 724 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively we had 13 billion and 11 billion in shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

as of december 31 2019  the amount of unrestricted cash held by our nonus subsidiaries was 459 million due to us tax reform the majority of our foreign earnings since january 1 2018 have been subject to immediate us income taxation and consequently the existing nonus unrestricted cash balance can be distributed to the us in the future with no material additional income tax consequences 

our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of nonspeculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash such as overnight deposits term deposits money market funds mutual funds for treasury investments short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets we may invest a portion of our cash in excess of shortterm operating needs in investmentgrade marketable debt securities including government or governmentsponsored agencies and corporate debt securities 

repurchases of our common stock may be made from time to time on the open market through established trading plans in privatelynegotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with all applicable securities laws rules and regulations in 2019 and 2018  we repurchased 174 million shares and 163 million shares respectively of our outstanding common stock at a cost of 15 billion and 12 billion  respectively in 2019 we repurchased 161 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of 14 billion under our rule 10b51 trading plan and 13 million shares at a cost of 100 million on the open market shares repurchased are held in treasury stock 

from time to time we enter into rule 10b51 trading plans as authorized by our board of directors to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock the timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a rule 10b51 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions in making a determination regarding any stock repurchases management considers multiple factors including overall stock market conditions our common stock price performance the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board of directors the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings our expected free cash flow and working capital needs our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources 

in september 2018 our board of directors approved an aggregate of 20 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective january 1 2019 in december 2019 our board of directors approved an aggregate of 24 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective january 1 2020 the 24 billion replaced the previous amount approved by the board of directors we expect this authorization to provide us with capacity for buybacks over six quarters and flexibility to act opportunistically we expect funding for any share repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our commercial paper program or our debt facilities 

we may discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate a rule 10b51 trading plan at any time the approval of our board of directors for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock in addition our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time 

cash flow 

the following table presents the major components of net changes in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents in millions 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital 

the 126 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 from 2018 is primarily a result of an increase in net income excluding certain noncash adjustments such as the 2018 noncash gain on mers and the 31 million impairment loss on the ice futures singapore exchange registration intangible asset in 2019 the remaining increase is due to fluctuations in our working capital and the timing of various payments such as transactionrelated expenses and taxes 

investing activities 

consolidated net cash provided by used in investing activities in 2019 and 2018 relates to cash paid for acquisitions purchases of investments proceeds from term deposits a return of capital related to our investment in occ proceeds from investments related to mers and changes in capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs

for additional details of our debt instruments refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

future capital requirements 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate of growth across our trading and clearing and data and listings segments strategic plans and acquisitions available sources for financing activities required and discretionary technology and clearing initiatives regulatory requirements the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products the geographic mix of our business and potential stock repurchases 

we currently expect to incur capital expenditures including operational and real estate capital expenditures and to incur software development costs that are eligible for capitalization ranging in the aggregate between 290 million and 320 million in 2020 which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology business integration and the continued growth of our businesses 

in december 2019 our board of directors approved an aggregate of 24 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective on january 1 2020 we expect this authorization to provide us with capacity for buybacks over six quarters and flexibility to act opportunistically refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional details on our stock repurchase plans 

our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend policy providing that dividends will be approved quarterly by the board or its audit committee taking into account factors such as our evolving business model prevailing business conditions our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives and our financial results and capital requirements without a predetermined net income payout ratio during 2019  we paid cash dividends of 110 per share of our common stock in the aggregate including quarterly dividends of 0275 per share for an aggregate payout of 621 million  which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years for the first quarter of 2020 we announced a 030 per share dividend payable on march 31 2020 to stockholders of record as of march 17 2020 

other than the facilities for the ice clearing houses our credit facility and our commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have for liquidity and capital resources with third parties see notes 10 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements where discussed further in the event of any strategic acquisitions mergers or investments or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders we may incur additional debt issue additional equity to raise necessary funds repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend however we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us see “risk factors and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

nongaap measures 

we use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent gaap measures or that supplement the information provided by our gaap measures we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business 

that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance 

we use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance including in this annual report and believe that these measures when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than gaap measures alone in addition we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making periodtoperiod comparisons of results because the adjustments to gaap are not reflective of our core business performance 

these financial measures are not presented in accordance with or as an alternative to gaap financial measures and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies we encourage investors to review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report including our consolidated financial statements to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons 

the table below outlines our adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income attributable to ice common stockholders and adjusted earnings per share which are nongaap measures that are calculated by making adjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance these measures including the adjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments in millions except for percentages and per share amounts are as follows 



acquisitionrelated transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses except for those that are directly related to the announcement closing financing or termination of a transaction however we adjust for the acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs relating to interactive data given the magnitude of the 56 billion purchase price of this acquisition the integration of interactive data was completed by june 2018 amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles are included in nongaap adjustments as excluding these noncash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results 

we include the 2019 impairment of exchange registration intangible assets on ice futures singapore as a nongaap adjustment this impairment is not based on our core business operations but rather was a result of the estimated fair value of an acquired intangible asset falling below its carrying value see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

we include the 2019 promissory note impairment charges on work performed by the original plan processor on the cat as a nongaap adjustment this is included as a nongaap adjustment as this is not considered a part of our core business operations see additional discussion on the cat above in item 1a risk factors in this annual report 

in addition we also include the following items as nongaap adjustments as each of these are not considered a part of our core business operations 

 the tax items in nongaap adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pretax nongaap adjustments or tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance the following taxrelated items are included as nongaap adjustments 

 for additional information on these items refer to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and “ recent developments” “ consolidated operating expenses” “ consolidated nonoperating income expenses” and “consolidated income tax provision” above 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as described in notes 3 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this annual report certain clearing house collateral and bakkt custodial assets are reported offbalance sheet we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following presents our contractual obligations which we intend to fund from existing cash as well as cash flow from operations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2019 in millions 



purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments listed above 650 billion in cash margin deposits guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund the cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them ice ngx administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts it has an equal and offsetting claim to and from its respective participants on opposite sides of the physicallysettled contract each of which is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable 

we have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits or utbs as of december 31 2019  our cumulative utbs were 103 million and interest and penalties related to utbs were 33 million we are under examination by various tax authorities we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax interest and penalties if any that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our utbs 

as of december 31 2019  we through nyse have net obligations of 150 million related to our pension and other benefit programs the date of payment under these net obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs 

in addition the future funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the sros and brokerdealers to date however funding has been provided solely by the sros and future funding is expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the sec and subsequently collected by industry members see  nongaap measures above 

new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us 

critical accounting policies 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and reevaluate them on a periodic basis based on these factors we make estimates and judgments about among other things the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies among others affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results assets and liabilities 

goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 

assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets including identified intangible assets we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles such as customer relationships trademarks technology trading products data exchange registrations trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift our judgments and estimates may change which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not 

in performing the allocation of the acquisitions purchase price to assets and liabilities we consider among other factors the intended use of the acquired assets analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business at the acquisition date a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist we continue to review and assess our estimates assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by gaap which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition accordingly these estimates and assumptions are subject to change which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements estimation uncertainty may exist due to the sensitivity of the respective fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of an acquired business in our discounted cash flow models significant assumptions typically include revenue growth rates and expense synergies that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate 

our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and we have identified four reporting units our futures reporting unit our data and listings reporting unit our cash equities reporting unit and our fixed income and credit reporting unit these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinitelived intangibles to its estimated fair value 

goodwill impairment testing consists of a twostep methodology the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value including goodwill and other intangible assets of such reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no impairment loss is recognized and the second step which is a calculation of the impairment is not performed however if the carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value for annual goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill and other intangible assets if we conclude that this is the case we must perform the twostep methodology described above otherwise no further testing is required for annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount for our goodwill impairment testing we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and apply the quantitative approach for our testing of indefinitelived intangible assets we apply qualitative and quantitative approaches 

application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows longterm growth rates of our business operating margins discount rates weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets these estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment and changes to these estimates and assumptions as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor impairment during 2019 we recorded an impairment charge of 31 million on the remaining value of exchange registration intangible assets on ice futures singapore as a result of a decrease in fair value determined during our annual impairment testing 

we are also required to evaluate other finitelived intangible assets for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable if impairment indicators are present then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these longlived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable if an asset is not recoverable the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis

we are subject to income taxes in the us uk and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse 

sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 or sab 118 provided guidance for companies that had not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja in the period of enactment allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts as of december 31 2018 we had completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tcja we reaffirmed our position that we were not subject to transition tax under the tcja as of december 31 2017 in addition we concluded that the 764 million of deferred tax benefit recorded in the 2017 financial statements was a reasonable estimate of the tcja’s impact on our deferred tax and no further adjustments are necessary 

the fasb staff also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of global intangible lowtaxed income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred we have completed our analysis of the effects of these provisions and have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred 

we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position if the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 

we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter at any point in time many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities changes in facts and circumstances issuance of new regulations and resolution of tax audits 

we believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 




 

item 7 a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a result of our operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure manage monitor and report risk exposures which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2019 and 2018  our cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments were 22 billion and 20 billion respectively of which 282 million and 275 million respectively were denominated in pounds sterling euros or canadian dollars and the remaining amounts are denominated in us dollars we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in shortterm interest rates would decrease annual pretax earnings by 15 million as of december 31 2019  assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2019  we had 78 billion in outstanding debt of which 65 billion relates to our senior notes which bear interest at fixed interest rates the remaining amount outstanding of 13 billion relates to our commercial paper program which bears interest at fluctuating rates and therefore subjects us to interest rate risk and a subsidiary line of credit a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program as of december 31 2019 would decrease annual pretax earnings by 13 million  assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper program decreased from 248 as of december 31 2018 to 184 as of december 31 2019 the decrease in the commercial paper program weighted average interest rate was primarily due to the decisions by the us federal reserve to decrease the federal funds shortterm interest rate by 25 basis points in each of july september and october of 2019 the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in shortterm interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as an international business we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling canadian dollars or euros and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros certain assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2019 and 2018 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table dollars in millions except exchange rates 



 we have a significant part of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros in 2019 and 2018  13 and 14  respectively of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros and 12 and 13  respectively of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes the us equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly 

foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables occurs through our operations which are received in or paid in pounds sterling canadian dollars or euros due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of 5 million and 2 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively the foreign currency transaction losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar a 10 adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2019  assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity would result in a foreign currency loss of 2 million 

we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2019 and 2018 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities 

we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using a current rate of exchange with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account a component of equity our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below in millions 



foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within our balance sheet see the table below for the portion of equity attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments 

as well as the activity by year included within our statement of other comprehensive income the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate differences in the table below were primarily driven by fluctuations of the pound sterling as compared to the us dollar which were 13260  12756 and 13510 as of december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 



the future impact on our business relating to the uk leaving the eu and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time including future impacts on currency exchange rates 

credit risk 

we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests 

clearing house cash deposit risks 

the ice clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit market and liquidity risks refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ice clearing houses cash and cash equivalent deposits which were 650 billion as of december 31 2019  while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits as the ice clearing houses may pass on interest revenues minus costs to the clearing members this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated 

 an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties our policies require diversification of counterparties banks financial institutions bond issuers and funds so as to avoid a concentration of risk 



maturities in addition the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt for example us treasury securities and supranational debt instruments euro cash deposits only with short dated maturities 

 the ice clearing houses may use thirdparty investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house such advisors do not hold clearing member cash or cash equivalent deposits or the underlying investments clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians including jpmorgan chase bank na citibank na bny mellon bmo harris na and euroclear bank brussels for nonus dollar deposits the ice clearing houses employ or may employ multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives 

 impact of inflation 

we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant in the event of inflation we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants as the prices that we charge are not governed by longterm contracts

item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe could materially adversely affect us other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect us in the future if any of the risks discussed below actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected accordingly you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this annual report 

global economic political and financial market events or conditions may negatively impact our business 

global economic political and market conditions may impact our business adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment government shutdowns currency fluctuations actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending if our customers reduce spending workforce trading activity or demand for financial data as a result of challenges in the prevailing economic markets our revenues could decline 

a significant portion of our revenues are derived from fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets we derived 44 42 and 43 of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses from our net transactionbased revenues in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively in particular we derive a significant percentage of our net transactionbased revenues from trading in ice brent crude futures and options contracts north american natural gas futures and options contracts sugar futures and options contracts equity transactions and shortterm interest rates contracts including the euribor and short sterling futures and options contracts the trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of trading activity for any reason including 

 a reduction in our overall trading volume could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenues a reduction in trading volumes could also result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for our market data which would further reduce our overall revenue 

further nyse’s revenue increases when more companies are seeking access to public markets and stagnation or a decline in the ipo market could have an adverse effect on our revenues the number of public companies in the us has decreased significantly over the last 20 years 

a prolonged government shutdown could negatively impact our business our regulated exchanges and clearinghouses are required to obtain regulatory approvals from the cftc andor sec in the ordinary course of business and failure or delay to provide these approvals could adversely affect our business and our ability to introduce new products and services 

in addition during a government shutdown the sec may not be able to review the registration statements that are seeking to do an initial public offering which could have a negative impact on our listings business 

as of december 31 2018 we own 100 of mers which operates a national electronic database that tracks changes in mortgage servicing and beneficial ownership interests in us residential loans if there is a continued rise in interest rates or introduction of restrictions or limits on mortgage lending that leads to a reduction in mortgage activity in the us our results could be negatively impacted 

the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the uks exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit the uncertainty surrounding the terms of brexit could negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions that could continue for the foreseeable future since uk voters approved brexit in june 2016 brexit has created political and economic uncertainty and instability in the global markets including currency and credit markets particularly in the uk and eu political and economic uncertainty has in the past led to and the outcome of brexit could lead to certain macroeconomic conditions that adversely affect our business adverse macroeconomic consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates legal uncertainty potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate andor prohibitive laws and regulations may adversely affect both demand for our products and services and our ability to deliver our products and services into the eu the long term effects of brexit will depend in part on any agreements the uk makes or does not make to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently 

in november 2018 the eu and the uk agreed upon the terms of an agreement which sets out the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the eu and includes a transitional period until december 31 2020 if the agreement is not ratified by the eu and uk before the end of march 2019 then absent the uk withdrawing its notice under article 50 or members of the eu agreeing to extend the twoyear notice period the uk will leave the eu with no agreements in place beyond those temporary arrangements which have or may be put in place by the eu or individual eu member states and the uk as part of nodeal contingency efforts and those conferred by mutual membership of the world trade organization given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what financial trade and legal implications the uk leaving the eu with no agreements in place would have and how such withdrawal would affect us impacts could include access to our services by persons located in the eu being prohibited or becoming more expensive which could negatively impact our profitability 

our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to increased legislation and regulatory scrutiny and we face the risk of changes to this regulatory environment and business in the future 

we are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in many jurisdictions around the world and in particular in the us and the uk where the largest portions of our operations are conducted we face the risk of significant actions by regulatory and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments that may affect our business the activity of our market participants and as a consequence our results among other things as a result of regulators and tax authorities enforcing existing laws and regulations we could be censured fined prohibited from pursuing certain acquisitions or engaging in some of our business activities subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities including fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory pricing restrictions also known as frand or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees including settlement payments interest payments and penalty payments in many cases our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions 

there is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could be imposed this could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients’ overall trading volume through our exchanges and demand for our market data and other services the us government in particular has indicated a goal of reforming many aspects of existing financial services regulations some areas identified as subject to potential change amendment or repeal include the doddfrank act and the authorities of the federal reserve and fsoc however it is unknown at this time to what extent new legislation will be passed into law or pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted or modified or the effect that such passage adoption or modification will have positively or negatively on our industry or on us there is also increasing public concern regarding data privacy and data protection and many jurisdictions have passed laws in 

this area such as the european union general data protection regulation and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us 

these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our stockholders and creditors for example the adoption and implementation of position limit rules in the us and the eu could have an impact on our commodities business if comparable trading venues in foreign jurisdictions are not subject to equivalent rules position limits became effective in the eu beginning january 2018 and in certain cases the position limits are lower than us equivalent contracts and in other cases position limits are higher than us equivalent contracts these divergent regulations may cause us to move products from one jurisdiction to another as a result of business risks and competitive challenges and could significantly increase the regulatory compliance costs for our customers which could have a negative impact on our business 

us and eu legal and regulatory developments in response to the global financial crisis in particular the doddfrank act emir mifid ii and the bmr have significantly altered and propose to further alter the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability the enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes most likely to affect our businesses are position limit rules in the us and the eu nondiscriminatory access provisions of mifid ii interoperability and margin rules in emir enhanced regulatory capital liquidity and leverage rules in basel iii and capital requirements directive iv access rules under the bmr the nonharmonization of margin requirements implementation of a financial transaction tax access to our benchmarks and maintaining our exchanges’ abilities to operate as sros with related immunity for the discharge of their regulatory functions as the operator of global businesses the lack of harmonization in international financial reform efforts could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in multiple jurisdictions 

the doddfrank act established enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the fsoc ice clear credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the fsoc and as a result is subject to additional oversight by the cftc 

in 2016 the sec approved a plan to establish a marketwide consolidated audit trail or cat to improve regulators’ ability to monitor trading activity in 2018 the first phase of implementation went live and required participants to begin reporting to the cat with a phased implementation of the provisions of the cat through 2019 due to delays in implementation and failure to implement required functionality there is an increased risk to execution venues which includes us of regulatory action by the sec in addition to increased risk in connection with our regulatory obligations implementation of the cat could result in significant additional expenditures which may not be reimbursed funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the execution venues and industry members to date however funding has been provided solely by the execution venues in exchange for promissory notes expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the sec and are collected to fund the cat until the sec approves a funding model that shares the cost of the cat between the execution venues and industry members the execution venues may continue to incur additional significant costs and there is a risk such funding model may result in the uncollectibility of the issued promissory notes as of december 31 2018 we have accrued approximately 16 million as a receivable in connection with our portion of expenses related to the cat implementation 

we are subject to tax laws regulations rulings and audits in multiple us and nonus jurisdictions that could have a significant impact on our business and lead to additional expenditures for us or our customers for example there have been discussions in various jurisdictions around financial transaction or digital service tax frameworks implementation of any new or amended taxes or regulations could impact our global operations or trading volumes if adopted 

other enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations 

our business is subject to the impact of financial markets volatility including the prices and interest rates underlying our derivative products due to conditions that are beyond our control 

trading volume in our markets and products is largely driven by the degree of volatility  the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations  in prices and levels of the underlying commodities securities indices financial benchmarks or other instruments volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates opportunities for investment and speculative or arbitrage trading were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices or levels of the underlying commodities securities indices benchmarks or other instruments of our products we could experience lower trading volumes slower growth or declines in revenues 

factors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility and thus trading volumes include 

 any one or more of these factors which are beyond our control may reduce trading activity which could make our markets less attractive as a source of liquidity and in turn could further discourage existing and potential market participants and thus accelerate a decline in the level of trading activity and potentially related services such as data or clearing further lower market volatility could also result in more exchanges competing for trading volumes to maintain their growth if any of these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets could be jeopardized because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our current products and services decline for any reason we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues which would cause our net income to decline 

systems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry could negatively impact us 

highprofile system failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry could negatively impact our business and result in a loss of confidence in our technology and our markets regulatory investigations fines and penalties and business activity slowdown or interruptions further regulators have imposed requirements for trading platforms that have been costly for us to implement and could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services in particular the sec’s regulation systems compliance and integrity or regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations subject portions of our securities and derivatives trading platforms and other technological systems related to our clearing houses trade repositories and the us sef to more extensive regulation and oversight ensuring our compliance with the requirements of regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations requires significant implementation costs as well as increased ongoing administrative expenses and burdens in addition any expansion of the ice systems that are determined to be in scope for regulation sci could result in significant additional expenditures 

our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cyberattacks hacking and other cyber security risks especially in light of our role in the global financial marketplace which could result in wrongful manipulation disclosure or use of our information or that of a third party or which could make our participants unable or reluctant to use our electronic platform 

the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to reliably transact on our electronic platforms and provide financial data services are critical elements of our operations some of our products and services involve the 

storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential client data including client portfolio information if anyone gains improper access to our electronic platforms networks or databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify our confidential information or that of a third party breaches of our cybersecurity measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business our networks and those of our participants thirdparty service providers and external market infrastructures may be vulnerable to compromise unauthorized access security technology failure computer viruses social engineering denial of service attacks terrorism “ransom” attacks firewall or encryption failures or other security problems resulting in loss of data integrity information disclosure unavailability or fraud the financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of political protest activism and financial gain and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for cyberattack and other information security threats further former employees of certain companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly 

although we have not been the victim of cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity events including distributed denial of service attacks malware infections phishing web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size for example we detected and responded to the exploitation of a legacy web server in september 2018 while our controls prevented the attack from establishing persistent network access or expanding laterally into additional systems we did invoke our incident response procedures to eliminate the vector of attack and forensically confirm the limited extent of any data that was exposed further we exercised our thirdparty incident response arrangements to independently validate our findings while we operate an information security program that is designed to prevent detect track and mitigate cyber incidents and that has detected and mitigated such incidents in the past we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against attacks losses or reduced trading volume in our markets as a result of any security breach hacking or cyberattack any such attacks could result in reputational damage cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose customers cause us to experience lower current and future trading volumes or incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive position in addition given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or disable or degrade systems a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected and we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely the extent of a particular cyber incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while such an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it which may compound damages before the incident is discovered or remediated additionally as threats continue to evolve and increase and as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities which could adversely impact our net income 

owning clearing houses exposes us to risks including risks related to defaults by clearing members risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses 

there are risks inherent in operating clearing houses including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members market liquidity risks defaults by clearing members and risks associated with custody and investing margin or guaranty fund assets provided by clearing members to our clearing houses which could subject our business to substantial losses for example clearing members have transferred an aggregate amount of cash in ice clear europe relating to margin and guaranty funds of 309 billion as of december 31 2018  and a total of 640 billion for all of our clearing houses as of december 31 2018  ice clear europe and ice clear us use thirdparty investment managers for investment of cash assets and may add or change the investment managers from time to time to the extent available ice clear credit holds the us dollar cash and us treasuries that clearing members transfer to satisfy their original margin and guaranty fund requirements at its account at the federal reserve with respect to other clearing member cash posted ice clear credit currently selfmanages and uses external investment managers to invest such cash margin and guaranty fund deposits 

we have an obligation to return margin payments and guaranty fund contributions to clearing members to the extent that the relevant member’s risk based on its open contracts to the clearing house is reduced if a number of clearing members 

substantially reduce their open interest or default the concentration of risks within our clearing houses will be spread among a smaller pool of clearing members which would make it more difficult to absorb and manage risk in the event of a further clearing member’s default 

although our clearing houses have policies and procedures to help ensure that clearing members can satisfy their obligations such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a members or counterparty’s default in addition although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards it is a complex process and there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect us from the risks of clearing these products we cannot assure you that these measures and safeguards will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default we have contributed our own capital to the front of the guaranty fund of the clearing houses that could be used in the event of a default furthermore the default of any one of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and cause our customers to lose confidence in the guaranty of our clearing houses 

a decline in the value of securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions by our clearing houses or default by a sovereign government issuer could pose additional risks of default by clearing members 

our clearing houses hold a substantial amount of assets as margin or guaranty fund contributions which comprise us and other sovereign treasury securities as of december 31 2018  our clearing houses held 543 billion of noncash margin or guaranty fund contributions in us and other sovereign treasury securities 415 billion of this amount was comprised of us treasury securities 18 billion of french treasury securities 17 billion of german treasury securities 12 billion of italian treasury securities 14 billion of uk treasury securities and 66 billion of other european japanese and triparty treasury securities sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest and most liquid securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived credit worthiness of major governments however the markets for such securities have experienced significant volatility during the past decade and as of late due to ongoing financial challenges in some of the major european countries and the us government’s negotiations regarding taxation spending cuts and raising the debt ceiling which is the maximum amount of debt that the us government can legally incur in addition if there is a collapse of the euro our clearing houses would face significant expenses in changing their systems and such an event could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates to mitigate this risk our clearing houses currently apply a discount or “haircut” to the market values for all sovereign securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions however market conditions could change more quickly than we adjust the amount of the haircuts and the haircuts could be insufficient in the event of a sudden market event 

notwithstanding the current intraday margin and valuation checks conducted by our clearing houses and our policies and practices to limit exposures our clearing houses will need to continue to monitor the volatility and value of sovereign treasury securities if the value of these securities declines significantly our clearing houses will need to collect additional margin or guaranty fund contributions from their clearing members which may be difficult for the members to supply in a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government in addition our clearing houses may be required to impose a more significant discount on the value of sovereign treasury securities posted as margin or guaranty fund contributions if there is uncertainty regarding the future value of these securities which would trigger the need for additional margin or guaranty fund contributions by the clearing members if a clearing member cannot supply the additional margin or guaranty fund contributions which may include cash in a currency acceptable to the clearing house the clearing house would deem the clearing member in default if any clearing members default as a result of the reduction in the value of margin or guaranty fund contributions our clearing houses and trading business could suffer substantial losses as a result of the loss of any capital that has been contributed to the clearing house’s guaranty funds and a loss of confidence by clearing members in the clearing house resulting in a reduction in volumes of future cleared transactions 

further our clearing houses invest large sums through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions in the event that a reverse repo counterparty defaults the value of the sovereign securities we hold as collateral might not be sufficient to cover our losses our clearing houses may also make demand deposits with banks that are secured only to the value of federal deposit insurance corporation or fdic insurance or other national deposit guarantee schemes which is small and therefore the deposits may in significant part be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent 

owning and operating equity and options exchanges exposes us to additional risks including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject 

owning and operating equity and options exchanges for which the revenues are primarily derived from trading activity market data and listing fees exposes us to additional risks adverse economic conditions and regulatory changes similar to those discussed above including changes to the number of exchanges that are permitted to conduct closing auctions could result in decreased trading volume on our exchanges discourage market participants from listing on our equity and options exchanges or cause them to forgo new offerings any of these could reduce our revenues including market data revenue 

our exchanges are operated as forprofit businesses but have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled specifically our exchanges are responsible for enforcing listed company compliance with applicable listing standards overseeing regulatory policy determinations rule interpretation and regulationrelated rule development and conducting trading reviews any failure by one of our exchanges with selfregulatory responsibility to comply with and enforce compliance by their members with exchange rules and securities laws could significantly harm our reputation prompt regulatory scrutiny result in the payment of fines or penalties and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we must allocate significant resources to fulfill our selfregulatory responsibilities the forprofit exchanges’ goal of maximizing stockholder value might contradict the exchanges’ selfregulatory responsibilities the listing of our common stock on the nyse could potentially create a conflict between the exchange’s regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities on the one hand and our commercial and economic interest on the other hand while we have structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful 

further changes in the rules and operations of our securities markets must be reviewed and approved by the sec approval of such changes by the sec cannot be guaranteed and the sec could delay either the approval process or the initiation of the public comment process any denial or delay in approving changes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our compliance and risk management methods as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations might not be effective which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators 

our ability to comply with complex and changing laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel regulators periodically review our exchanges’ ability to selfregulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including selfregulatory standards in particular certain of our businesses associated with the nyse group are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations policies and procedures if we fail to comply with any of these obligations regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business 

our acquisitions expose us to new regulatory requirements for example as a result of our acquisitions of interactive data and securities evaluations we operate two secregistered investment advisers investment advisers are subject to significant regulatory obligations under the investment advisers act prior to these acquisitions none of our businesses were registered under the investment advisers act compliance with the investment advisers act and other regulatory requirements gives rise to costs and expenses that may be material in addition our acquisition of the bondpoint ats in january 2018 exposes us to increased exposure to regulatory scrutiny from the sec and finra and our acquisition of tmc bonds in july 2018 exposes us to regulatory scrutiny from finra 

our regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses we will continue to face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our financial condition operating results or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business further any settlement consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or regulatory agencies begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities finally the implementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to remain competitive and grow our business 

we face intense competition 

we face intense competition in all aspects of our business and our competitors both domestic and international are numerous we currently compete with 

 trends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings finally many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and ats businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business 

we also face pricing competition in many areas of our business a decline in our fees due to competitive pressure the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for example ice data services’ business has benefited from a high renewal rate in its subscriptionbased business but we cannot assure you that this will continue we also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings modify the pricing for our products or retain our current customers or attract new customers if we are not able to compete successfully our business could be materially impacted including our ability to remain as an operating entity 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we have achieved a tremendous amount of growth since becoming a public company in 2005 our growth is highly dependent on customer demand for our core products and services favorable economic conditions and our ability to invest in our personnel facilities infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls adverse economic conditions could reduce customer demand for our products and services which may place a significant strain on our management and resources and could force us to defer existing or future planned opportunities we regularly evaluate our existing operations service capacity and business efficiencies and as a result of such evaluations we may undertake strategic initiatives outside of and within our businesses in addition we may not be successful in executing on our strategies to support our growth organically or through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances 

failure to evolve our benchmarks and indices in a manner that maintains the relevance of the benchmark or index damage to our reputation resulting from our administration of libor or other benchmarks and indices and the potential replacement of libor could adversely affect our business 

we operate multiple global benchmark products and indices across our asset classes and a significant portion of our volume is based on these products to ensure continued trading in our benchmark products and indices we must be able to demonstrate that our products are not readily subject to manipulation and we must continue to evolve our products to maintain their relevance our subsidiary iba is the administrator for various benchmarks including libor iba’s administration of libor is the result of the libor scandal which was a series of fraudulent actions taken by banks that were submitting false libor rates to profit from trades or to give the impression that the banks were more creditworthy than they were any failures negative publicity or lawsuits resulting from our administration of libor or other benchmarks could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and could harm our business and our reputation 

in january 2019 we were named as a defendant in two virtually identical proposed class action lawsuits regarding the administration of libor that allege that we and 18 multinational banks engaged in a conspiracy to set the libor benchmark at artificially low levels also in july 2017 the fca announced the desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 there is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of libor or of any particular replacement rate the federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions announced replacement of us dollar libor with a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by us treasury securities called the sofr the first publication of sofr was released in april 2018 whether or not sofr attains market traction as a libor replacement tool remains in question and the future of libor at this time is uncertain as a result it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes establishment of alternative references rates or other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the uk or elsewhere the elimination of libor or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities 

we intend to launch new products and services and continue to explore and pursue other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may spend substantial time and money developing new product offerings or improving current product offerings if these offerings are not successful we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to recover the costs of such initiatives obtaining any required regulatory approval associated with these offerings may also result in delays or restrictions on our ability to benefit fully from these offerings further we may seek to enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry introducing or maintaining our offerings in certain countries may also be subject to a number of other risks including currency exchange rate risk difficulties enforcing agreements or collecting receivables longer payment cycles compliance with the laws or regulations of these countries and political and regulatory uncertainties 

in addition in light of consolidation in the exchange data services and clearing sectors and competition for opportunities we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully our competitors could merge making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors also offering new products and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives that are necessary for our success 

we have made substantial progress toward developing and deploying new technology platforms to improve our equity exchange business and data services business we may experience disruptions or encounter unexpected challenges in deploying these new systems further the costs to complete the remaining work may exceed our current expectations any significant cost increases or disruptions to product quality sales effectiveness or client service or to our other business operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences we may not be able to compete effectively 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary and acquired technology the financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change change in use patterns change in client preferences frequent product and service introductions and the emergence of new industry standards and practices these changes could render our existing proprietary technology uncompetitive or obsolete we are in the process of implementing a new trading technology system at nyse and if there are trading disruptions or if the new system has inadequate performance we could suffer material losses incur reputational damage or be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny 

further we use some opensource software in our technology most often as small components within a larger product or service to augment algorithms functionalities or libraries we create and we may use more opensource software in the future opensource code is also contained in some thirdparty software we rely on we could be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of the license for such opensource software the terms of many opensource licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us or other courts and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology to our clients’ requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and costeffective manner any failure to remain abreast 

of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to client preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our results 

our business may be harmed by computer and communication systems failures and delays 

our business depends on the integrity reliability and security of our infrastructure which is highly dependent on our computer and communication systems we support and maintain many of the systems that comprise our electronic platforms and our failure to monitor or maintain these systems or to find replacements for defective components within a system in a timely and costeffective manner when necessary could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business our customers rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate and highquality financial market data analytics and related solutions our timely reliable delivery of highquality products and services is subject to an array of technical production processes that enable our delivery platforms to leverage an extensive range of content databases our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach our systems or those of our thirdparty providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

 we could experience system failures due to power or telecommunications failures human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyberattacks intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar events if any one or more of these situations were to arise they could result in damage to our business reputation and participant dissatisfaction with our electronic platform which could prompt participants to trade elsewhere or expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions as a consequence our business financial condition and operating results could suffer materially 

our regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in volume of order and trading transaction traffic and to provide processing and clearing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses could be adversely affected 

we currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or satisfy our debt service obligations 

as of december 31 2018 we had 74 billion of outstanding debt this level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt service obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities as we use our available resources to reduce and refinance our consolidated debt our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue future business opportunities may be further restrained in addition the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio test and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of 

liens and other matters further a portion of our outstanding debt has been in commercial paper which is subject to interest rate changes rising interest rates will result in an increase in our interest expense 

our longterm and shortterm debt is currently rated by moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s these ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time and it is possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade our credit ratings in the future in particular our inability to sustain reduced debt on a consolidated basis may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings a significant downgrade of our credit ratings could impact customers’ willingness to use our clearing houses make parties less willing to do business with us and could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase the cost of our commercial paper and any future debt funding we may obtain 

we may fail to complete or realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our recent acquisitions and future acquisitions which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we have completed many acquisitions and plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to integrate these businesses into our existing operations and realize anticipated cost savings revenue synergies and growth opportunities we generally set aggressive timelines for realizing savings   which assumes we successfully undertake a variety of actions including but not limited to integrating technology eliminating redundancies and effecting organizational restructurings that are themselves subject to a variety of risks and may be subject to regulatory approvals that we do not control the process of integrating acquired companies is time consuming and could disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties including inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants regulators and others require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of the business 

there is a risk however that we may not integrate these acquired companies in a manner that permits our expected cost savings and revenue synergies to be fully realized in the time periods expected or at all in addition a variety of factors including but not limited to regulatory conditions governmental competition approvals currency fluctuations and difficulty integrating technology platforms may adversely affect our ability to complete our acquisitions or realize our anticipated cost savings and synergies 

we may also not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures or alliances that we have entered into or may enter into for a number of reasons including regulatory or government approvals or changes global market changes contractual obligations competing products and in some instances our lack of or limited control over the management of the business further strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future 

as a result of any future acquisition we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest expend cash incur debt assume actual and contingent liabilities inherit existing or pending litigation or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets further we cannot assure you that any such financing or equity investments will be available with terms that will be favorable to us or available at all 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

since we conduct operations in several different countries including the us uk eu and canada substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling euros and canadian dollars because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

external events such as brexit and the negotiations regarding the terms thereof the passage of us taxation reform legislation and recent actions of the us administration under president donald trump each have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially among the us dollar the british pound sterling and the euro if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the uk eu the us or other 

key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further the value of the pound sterling and euro and the global credit markets may further weaken general financial instability in countries in the eu could have a contagion effect on the region and contribute to the general instability and uncertainty in the eu events that adversely affect our uk and eu clients and suppliers could in turn have a materially adverse effect on our international business results and our operating results 

for additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk refer to “ foreign currency exchange rate risk” in item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk which is included in this annual report” 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill other intangible assets or investments 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2018  we had goodwill of  131 billion  and net other intangible assets of  105 billion  relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties 

our equity investments including our investments in euroclear and coinbase global inc among others are now subject to valuation under asu 201601 in accordance with asu 201601 we will only adjust the fair value of these investments if and when there is an observable price change in an orderly transaction of a similar or identical investment or indication of impairment and any change in the fair value will be recognized in net income 

we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may result in asset impairments an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill other intangible assets and other investments and assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 

for additional information on our goodwill other intangible assets and investments refer to notes 3 4 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements and “ critical accounting policies  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets” in item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which are included in this annual report 

we may face liability for content contained in our data products and services 

we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation libel copyright or trademark infringement fraud or negligence or based on other theories of liability in each case relating to the data articles commentary ratings information or other content we distribute in our financial data services if such data or other content or information that we distribute has errors is delayed or has design defects we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our corporate website or those websites that we own and operate through links to other websites use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for significant amounts any such claim even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us could involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and a negative impact on our reputation 

in addition we license and redistribute data and content from various third parties and the terms of these licenses change frequently our thirdparty data and content suppliers may audit our use of and our clients’ use of and payment for data and content from time to time in the ordinary course of business including audits currently underway such thirdparty data and content suppliers may assert that we or our clients owe additional amounts under the terms of the applicable license agreements that we inappropriately distributed the thirdparty data or that we or our clients used the data or content in a manner that exceeded the scope of the applicable license agreement or without a license agreement we have and expect to continue to spend and allocate resources to develop and acquire the use of technology and other intellectual property rights to manage these risks and track thirdparty data usage but we cannot be assured that we will not incur liability we may incur costs to investigate any allegations and may be required to pay damages to or make unexpected settlement payments to these data and content suppliers and these costs and payments could be material 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties including trademarks service marks trade names trade secrets copyrights and patents we cannot assure you 

that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property additionally we may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively further we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights which may require significant financial and managerial resources as a result we may choose not to enforce our infringed intellectual property rights depending on our strategic evaluation and judgment regarding the best use of our resources the relative strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the recourse available to us 

in addition our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may have obtained and may be expected to obtain in the future patent and intellectual property rights related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents and intellectual property rights that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services as a result we may face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents and intellectual property rights held by others we may be subject to lawsuits or required to stop developing or marketing the products or services obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the holders of the patents and intellectual property or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patents we also could be required to pay damages if we were found to infringe patents held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

regulatory changes or court rulings may have an adverse impact on our ability to derive revenue from market data and connectivity fees 

regulatory developments or court rulings in the us could reduce the amount of revenue that we obtain from market data and connectivity fees with respect to our us equities and equity options exchanges our ability to assess fees for market data products and certain connectivity fees are subject to review by the sec there continues to be opposing industry viewpoints and litigation as to the extent that our us equities and equity options exchanges should be able to charge for market data and market access and the manner in which we set such exchange fees could be reassessed in october 2018 the sec unanimously issued an opinion setting aside certain market data fees imposed by nyse arca inc and nasdaq stock market llc which were challenged by the securities industry and financial markets association or sifma finding that the exchanges had not met their statutory obligation to demonstrate that the fees were consistent with the exchange act ie that these fees are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory simultaneously the sec remanded over 400 market data fee and other filings back to the exchanges and the national market system plans for consideration under the standards set out in the sifma order and an earlier order issued by the sec relating to a separate litigation matter 

if new constraints are placed on our ability to charge for market data it could have a negative impact on our revenues we cannot predict whether or in what form any regulatory or other changes will take effect or their impact on our business a determination by the sec or a court for example that the sec must link market data fees to marginal costs take a more active role in the market data ratesetting process or reduce the current levels of market data fees could have an adverse effect on our market data revenues 

separately our european exchanges are currently authorized to sell trade information on a nondiscriminatory basis at a reasonable cost this regulatory position could be modified or interpreted by the european commission or future european court decisions in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our european market data revenues 

we rely on thirdparty providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of an important service data or content supplied by any third party or the loss of an exclusive license could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as online service providers hosting service and software providers data processors software and hardware vendors banks local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading clearing data services and other systems we rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with third parties and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for 

the provision of hosting services we also depend on thirdparty suppliers for data and content including data received from certain competitors clients various government and public record services and financial institutions used in our products and services some of this data is exclusive to particular suppliers and may not be obtained from other suppliers in addition our data suppliers could enter into exclusive contracts with our competitors without our knowledge the general trend toward industry consolidation may increase the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future if these companies were to discontinue providing services to us for any reason or fail to provide the type of service agreed to we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients or increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines our thirdparty data suppliers perform audits on us from time to time in the ordinary course of business to determine if data we license for redistribution has been properly accounted for in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreement as a result of these audits we may incur additional expenses 

many of our clients also rely on third parties to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform if these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients’ inability to transact with our businesses we hold exclusive licenses to list various index futures and contracts in the future litigation or regulatory action may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and contracts trading to a single exchange and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license mifid ii introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of services relating to commodity derivatives across europe and the legislation requires open access to any benchmarks a benchmark is an index or other measure used to determine the value of a financial instrument for example libor or the sp 500 used in europe if unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive license were permitted we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products 

we are subject to significant litigation and liability risks 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our participants involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred for example dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platform or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades abusive trading practices security and confidentiality breaches mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants in addition because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by entering them inaccurately a large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets 

in addition we are subject to ongoing legal disputes that could result in the payment of fines penalties or damages and could expose us to additional liability in the future for example on december 19 2017 the us court of appeals for the second circuit or the second circuit issued its decision in city of providence v bats global markets et al two of our subsidiaries new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca inc are defendants in this case in vacating the district court’s dismissal of this lawsuit and remanding for further proceedings the second circuit concluded in part that the defendant securities exchanges are not immune from the claims in this case because absolute immunity is available to an sro like the new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca inc only when they carry out regulatory functions although our exchanges will continue to have other defenses available to them in securities litigation cases including in this matter limitations on the doctrine of absolute immunity could result in an increased exposure to litigation and to increased liability andor other legal expenses additionally in january 2019 two virtually identical proposed class action lawsuits were filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york asserting that various ice entities including ice benchmark administration engaged in an alleged conspiracy with the libor panel banks to set the libor benchmark at artificially low levels for the alleged purpose and effect of depressing payments by those banks to persons who engaged in interest rate transactions with the banks from february 2014 to the present while ice intends to vigorously defend these matters their outcome cannot be determined and adverse rulings could impact our financial condition and continued administration of the libor benchmark 

further we could incur significant expenses defending claims even those without merit which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us including those we are involved with due to acquisition activity may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we may have to establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered 

probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for a summary of our legal proceedings and claims 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

given our prominence in the global securities industry and the location of many of our properties and personnel in us and european financial centers including lower manhattan we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees in addition terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets including trading on exchanges any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

damage to our reputation could damage our business 

our business is highly competitive and our customers typically have options on where to conduct their business our management team and business operations benefit from being highly regarded in our industry maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and for maintaining our relationships with our regulators negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services operations risk management compliance with regulations or management team could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our existing business and business prospects 

owning and operating voice broker and electronic fixed income brokerage businesses exposes us to additional risk and these businesses are largely dependent on general market conditions 

our voice broker business provides brokerage services to clients in the form of agency transactions in commodity products in agency transactions customers pay transaction fees for trade execution services in which we connect buyers and sellers who settle their transactions directly in connection with our fixed income business our brokerdealers operate in both an agency and in a matched principal capacity also known as “riskless principal” when trading as matched principal we agree to buy instruments from one customer and sell them to another customer the amount of the fee generally depends on the spread between the buy and sell price of the security that is brokered on our platforms with respect to matched principal transactions a counterparty to a matched principal transaction may fail to fulfill its obligations or we may face liability for an unmatched trade we also face the risk of not being able to collect transaction or subscription based fees for brokerage and related services that we provide to our customers 

our success largely depends on key personnel including our senior management because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business the loss of senior management or other key personnel could harm our business 

our future performance depends in large part on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel including our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel competition for key personnel in the various localities and business segments in which we operate is intense our ability to attract and retain key personnel in particular senior management will be dependent on a number of factors including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent there is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who we rely upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives the loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel could harm our business in particular we may have to incur costs to replace senior officers or other key employees who leave and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner 

we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders principal and interest on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock is dividends from our subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results   

provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ice 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for ice these provisions make a change of control less likely which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of us and european equity exchanges for example our organizational documents include provisions that generally restrict any person either alone or together with its related persons from i voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10 of our outstanding voting capital stock including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock or ii beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock further our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to call special stockholders’ meetings or act by written consent and generally authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock in addition provisions of delaware law may have a similar effect such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders as defined under delaware law from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the board of directors 

risks to our business related to our investment in and operation of bakkt 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our majority investment in bakkt and the investment may introduce additional risks to our business due to its newly developed and evolving business model 

on august 3 2018 we formed a new company bakkt llc along with a group of organizations we have a majority ownership interest in bakkt bakkt intends to create an integrated platform that enables consumers and institutions to transact in digital assets and plans to include regulated trading clearing and custodial solutions for digital assets due to our majority ownership interest in bakkt we have increased financial and reputational risks if there is a failure to launch or if the launch of this new business is unsuccessful also there can be no assurance that we will receive the necessary regulatory approvals and support from customers to launch bakkt as planned or that bakkt will operate as anticipated or that we will realize the expected return on our investment we regularly evaluate our existing operations service capacity and business efficiencies and as a result of such evaluations we may undertake strategic initiatives outside of and within our businesses as a result it may take longer than expected for us to realize the expected returns from this investment or such returns may ultimately be less than anticipated furthermore our investment in bakkt entails numerous risks including risks relating to bakkt’s ability to 

 as digital assets and blockchain technologies become more widely available bakkt expects the services and products associated with them to continue to develop and evolve as a result from time to time bakkt may add modify or discontinue certain aspects of its business model relating to the product mix and service offerings future additions and modifications to bakkt’s business will increase the complexity of its business and place significant strain on our and bakkt’s management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we cannot offer any assurance that these or any other additions or modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to bakkt’s or our business 

distributed ledger technology is relatively new and we believe that the application of distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets is novel to the proposed bakkt systems and accordingly we have limited experience applying distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets the creation and operation of an exchange for the transfer of digital assets utilizing a distributed ledger to enable consumers and institutions to confirm that the blockchain underlying these digital assets has not been altered is subject to potential technical legal and regulatory constraints any problems that bakkt encounters with the operation of the bakkt systems including technical legal and regulatory problems could have a material adverse effect on its business and plan of operations 

hiring qualified and experienced personnel in this specialized technology space is difficult due to the high level of competition and scarcity of experience bakkt may have difficulty finding hiring and integrating qualified employees this could put a strain on existing ice employees and delay the work that these employees are performing for ice and ice’s subsidiaries in addition any potential issues or major decisions involving bakkt may divert the attention of management and resources from matters that are core or critical to ice’s business 

we anticipate that at the time of its launch bakkt will be dependent solely on trading volume from one product offering bakkts bitcoin futures contract for its clearing and transaction fee revenues and profits failure to establish the trading volume in bakkts bitcoin futures contract or any subsequent products released by bakkt would negatively impact bakkts business financial condition and operating results and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

digital currency custodial solutions and related technology including bakkt’s systems and custodial arrangements are subject to risks related to a loss of funds due to theft of cryptocurrencies employee or vendor sabotage security and cybersecurity risks system failures and other operational issues and a lack of sufficient insurance which could cause damage to our reputation and brand and bakkt’s reputation and brand 

bakkts systems and custodial solutions involve the processing storage and transmission of cryptocurrencies and data while bakkt will contractually limit the amount of exposure it will have in the event that the cryptocurrencies are stolen or misappropriated we cannot guarantee that these limits will protect us from additional liability and other damage the theft or misappropriation of cryptocurrencies held in custody by bakkt would likely result in financial loss reputational damage potential lack of trust from our customers in other business lines negative press coverage and diversion of management’s time and focus the secure storage and transmission of cryptocurrencies and data over networks will be a critical element of bakkt’s operations despite the defensive measures bakkt may take these threats may come from external factors such as governments organized crime hackers and other third parties such as outsourced or infrastructuresupport providers and application developers or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom bakkt has granted access to its systems 

cryptocurrency transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies may be irretrievable once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain an incorrect transfer of a cryptocurrency generally will not be reversible and bakkt may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft it is possible that through computer or human error or through theft or criminal action the cryptocurrency could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties or to uncontrolled accounts such events would have a material adverse effect on the ability of bakkt to continue as a going concern which would have a material adverse effect on our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

although the cryptocurrencies held by bakkt are insured bakkt may lose cryptocurrencies valued in excess of the insurance policy without any recourse unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions in the event of loss or loss of utility value there is no public insurer such as the securities investor protection corporation or the fdic to offer recourse to bakkt or to any investor and the misappropriated cryptocurrencies cannot easily be traced to the bad actor 

further when cryptocurrency custodial solutions or transfer venues whether involving bakkt systems or others experience system failures or other operational issues such events could result in a reduction in cryptocurrency prices or confidence and impact the success of bakkt and have a material adverse effect on the ability of bakkt to continue as a going concern 

regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of our majority ownership interest in bakkt or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects bakkt’s business prospects or operations and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

as cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies with certain governments deeming them illegal and others allowing their use and trade ongoing and future regulatory actions may impact the ability of bakkt to continue to operate and such actions could affect the ability 

of bakkt to continue as a going concern which would have a material adverse effect on the business prospects or operations of bakkt and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

the cftc designated bitcoin as a commodity and as such exchangetraded derivatives involving bitcoin are subject to the cftcs jurisdiction and enforcement powers although the cftc has suggested it is not particularly focused on pursuing such enforcement at this time and in fact there may be some limits on its ability to do so without a specific connection to commodities derivatives markets in the event that the cftc does pursue such enforcement and ultimately shuts down an exchange on which bakkt’s bitcoin futures contract is traded it may have a significant adverse impact on bakkts business and plan of operations and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

governments may in the future curtail or outlaw the acquisition use or redemption of cryptocurrencies ownership of holding or trading in cryptocurrencies may then be considered illegal and subject to sanction governments may also take regulatory action that may increase the cost andor subject cryptocurrency companies to additional regulation

item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe could materially adversely affect us other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect us in the future if any of the risks discussed below actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected accordingly you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this annual report 

global economic political and financial market events or conditions may negatively impact our business 

global economic political and market conditions may impact our business adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment government shutdowns currency fluctuations actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending if our customers reduce spending workforce trading activity or demand for financial data as a result of challenges in the prevailing economic markets our revenues could decline 

a significant portion of our revenues are derived from fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets we derived 44 42 and 43 of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses from our net transactionbased revenues in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively in particular we derive a significant percentage of our net transactionbased revenues from trading in ice brent crude futures and options contracts north american natural gas futures and options contracts sugar futures and options contracts equity transactions and shortterm interest rates contracts including the euribor and short sterling futures and options contracts the trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of trading activity for any reason including 

 a reduction in our overall trading volume could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenues a reduction in trading volumes could also result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for our market data which would further reduce our overall revenue 

further nyse’s revenue increases when more companies are seeking access to public markets and stagnation or a decline in the ipo market could have an adverse effect on our revenues the number of public companies in the us has decreased significantly over the last 20 years 

a prolonged government shutdown could negatively impact our business our regulated exchanges and clearinghouses are required to obtain regulatory approvals from the cftc andor sec in the ordinary course of business and failure or delay to provide these approvals could adversely affect our business and our ability to introduce new products and services 

in addition during a government shutdown the sec may not be able to review the registration statements that are seeking to do an initial public offering which could have a negative impact on our listings business 

as of december 31 2018 we own 100 of mers which operates a national electronic database that tracks changes in mortgage servicing and beneficial ownership interests in us residential loans if there is a continued rise in interest rates or introduction of restrictions or limits on mortgage lending that leads to a reduction in mortgage activity in the us our results could be negatively impacted 

the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the uks exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit the uncertainty surrounding the terms of brexit could negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions that could continue for the foreseeable future since uk voters approved brexit in june 2016 brexit has created political and economic uncertainty and instability in the global markets including currency and credit markets particularly in the uk and eu political and economic uncertainty has in the past led to and the outcome of brexit could lead to certain macroeconomic conditions that adversely affect our business adverse macroeconomic consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates legal uncertainty potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate andor prohibitive laws and regulations may adversely affect both demand for our products and services and our ability to deliver our products and services into the eu the long term effects of brexit will depend in part on any agreements the uk makes or does not make to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently 

in november 2018 the eu and the uk agreed upon the terms of an agreement which sets out the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the eu and includes a transitional period until december 31 2020 if the agreement is not ratified by the eu and uk before the end of march 2019 then absent the uk withdrawing its notice under article 50 or members of the eu agreeing to extend the twoyear notice period the uk will leave the eu with no agreements in place beyond those temporary arrangements which have or may be put in place by the eu or individual eu member states and the uk as part of nodeal contingency efforts and those conferred by mutual membership of the world trade organization given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what financial trade and legal implications the uk leaving the eu with no agreements in place would have and how such withdrawal would affect us impacts could include access to our services by persons located in the eu being prohibited or becoming more expensive which could negatively impact our profitability 

our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to increased legislation and regulatory scrutiny and we face the risk of changes to this regulatory environment and business in the future 

we are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in many jurisdictions around the world and in particular in the us and the uk where the largest portions of our operations are conducted we face the risk of significant actions by regulatory and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments that may affect our business the activity of our market participants and as a consequence our results among other things as a result of regulators and tax authorities enforcing existing laws and regulations we could be censured fined prohibited from pursuing certain acquisitions or engaging in some of our business activities subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities including fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory pricing restrictions also known as frand or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees including settlement payments interest payments and penalty payments in many cases our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions 

there is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could be imposed this could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients’ overall trading volume through our exchanges and demand for our market data and other services the us government in particular has indicated a goal of reforming many aspects of existing financial services regulations some areas identified as subject to potential change amendment or repeal include the doddfrank act and the authorities of the federal reserve and fsoc however it is unknown at this time to what extent new legislation will be passed into law or pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted or modified or the effect that such passage adoption or modification will have positively or negatively on our industry or on us there is also increasing public concern regarding data privacy and data protection and many jurisdictions have passed laws in 

this area such as the european union general data protection regulation and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us 

these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our stockholders and creditors for example the adoption and implementation of position limit rules in the us and the eu could have an impact on our commodities business if comparable trading venues in foreign jurisdictions are not subject to equivalent rules position limits became effective in the eu beginning january 2018 and in certain cases the position limits are lower than us equivalent contracts and in other cases position limits are higher than us equivalent contracts these divergent regulations may cause us to move products from one jurisdiction to another as a result of business risks and competitive challenges and could significantly increase the regulatory compliance costs for our customers which could have a negative impact on our business 

us and eu legal and regulatory developments in response to the global financial crisis in particular the doddfrank act emir mifid ii and the bmr have significantly altered and propose to further alter the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability the enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes most likely to affect our businesses are position limit rules in the us and the eu nondiscriminatory access provisions of mifid ii interoperability and margin rules in emir enhanced regulatory capital liquidity and leverage rules in basel iii and capital requirements directive iv access rules under the bmr the nonharmonization of margin requirements implementation of a financial transaction tax access to our benchmarks and maintaining our exchanges’ abilities to operate as sros with related immunity for the discharge of their regulatory functions as the operator of global businesses the lack of harmonization in international financial reform efforts could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in multiple jurisdictions 

the doddfrank act established enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the fsoc ice clear credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the fsoc and as a result is subject to additional oversight by the cftc 

in 2016 the sec approved a plan to establish a marketwide consolidated audit trail or cat to improve regulators’ ability to monitor trading activity in 2018 the first phase of implementation went live and required participants to begin reporting to the cat with a phased implementation of the provisions of the cat through 2019 due to delays in implementation and failure to implement required functionality there is an increased risk to execution venues which includes us of regulatory action by the sec in addition to increased risk in connection with our regulatory obligations implementation of the cat could result in significant additional expenditures which may not be reimbursed funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the execution venues and industry members to date however funding has been provided solely by the execution venues in exchange for promissory notes expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the sec and are collected to fund the cat until the sec approves a funding model that shares the cost of the cat between the execution venues and industry members the execution venues may continue to incur additional significant costs and there is a risk such funding model may result in the uncollectibility of the issued promissory notes as of december 31 2018 we have accrued approximately 16 million as a receivable in connection with our portion of expenses related to the cat implementation 

we are subject to tax laws regulations rulings and audits in multiple us and nonus jurisdictions that could have a significant impact on our business and lead to additional expenditures for us or our customers for example there have been discussions in various jurisdictions around financial transaction or digital service tax frameworks implementation of any new or amended taxes or regulations could impact our global operations or trading volumes if adopted 

other enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations 

our business is subject to the impact of financial markets volatility including the prices and interest rates underlying our derivative products due to conditions that are beyond our control 

trading volume in our markets and products is largely driven by the degree of volatility  the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations  in prices and levels of the underlying commodities securities indices financial benchmarks or other instruments volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates opportunities for investment and speculative or arbitrage trading were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices or levels of the underlying commodities securities indices benchmarks or other instruments of our products we could experience lower trading volumes slower growth or declines in revenues 

factors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility and thus trading volumes include 

 any one or more of these factors which are beyond our control may reduce trading activity which could make our markets less attractive as a source of liquidity and in turn could further discourage existing and potential market participants and thus accelerate a decline in the level of trading activity and potentially related services such as data or clearing further lower market volatility could also result in more exchanges competing for trading volumes to maintain their growth if any of these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets could be jeopardized because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our current products and services decline for any reason we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues which would cause our net income to decline 

systems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry could negatively impact us 

highprofile system failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry could negatively impact our business and result in a loss of confidence in our technology and our markets regulatory investigations fines and penalties and business activity slowdown or interruptions further regulators have imposed requirements for trading platforms that have been costly for us to implement and could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services in particular the sec’s regulation systems compliance and integrity or regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations subject portions of our securities and derivatives trading platforms and other technological systems related to our clearing houses trade repositories and the us sef to more extensive regulation and oversight ensuring our compliance with the requirements of regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations requires significant implementation costs as well as increased ongoing administrative expenses and burdens in addition any expansion of the ice systems that are determined to be in scope for regulation sci could result in significant additional expenditures 

our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cyberattacks hacking and other cyber security risks especially in light of our role in the global financial marketplace which could result in wrongful manipulation disclosure or use of our information or that of a third party or which could make our participants unable or reluctant to use our electronic platform 

the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to reliably transact on our electronic platforms and provide financial data services are critical elements of our operations some of our products and services involve the 

storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential client data including client portfolio information if anyone gains improper access to our electronic platforms networks or databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify our confidential information or that of a third party breaches of our cybersecurity measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business our networks and those of our participants thirdparty service providers and external market infrastructures may be vulnerable to compromise unauthorized access security technology failure computer viruses social engineering denial of service attacks terrorism “ransom” attacks firewall or encryption failures or other security problems resulting in loss of data integrity information disclosure unavailability or fraud the financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of political protest activism and financial gain and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for cyberattack and other information security threats further former employees of certain companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly 

although we have not been the victim of cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity events including distributed denial of service attacks malware infections phishing web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size for example we detected and responded to the exploitation of a legacy web server in september 2018 while our controls prevented the attack from establishing persistent network access or expanding laterally into additional systems we did invoke our incident response procedures to eliminate the vector of attack and forensically confirm the limited extent of any data that was exposed further we exercised our thirdparty incident response arrangements to independently validate our findings while we operate an information security program that is designed to prevent detect track and mitigate cyber incidents and that has detected and mitigated such incidents in the past we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against attacks losses or reduced trading volume in our markets as a result of any security breach hacking or cyberattack any such attacks could result in reputational damage cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose customers cause us to experience lower current and future trading volumes or incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive position in addition given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or disable or degrade systems a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected and we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely the extent of a particular cyber incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while such an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it which may compound damages before the incident is discovered or remediated additionally as threats continue to evolve and increase and as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities which could adversely impact our net income 

owning clearing houses exposes us to risks including risks related to defaults by clearing members risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses 

there are risks inherent in operating clearing houses including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members market liquidity risks defaults by clearing members and risks associated with custody and investing margin or guaranty fund assets provided by clearing members to our clearing houses which could subject our business to substantial losses for example clearing members have transferred an aggregate amount of cash in ice clear europe relating to margin and guaranty funds of 309 billion as of december 31 2018  and a total of 640 billion for all of our clearing houses as of december 31 2018  ice clear europe and ice clear us use thirdparty investment managers for investment of cash assets and may add or change the investment managers from time to time to the extent available ice clear credit holds the us dollar cash and us treasuries that clearing members transfer to satisfy their original margin and guaranty fund requirements at its account at the federal reserve with respect to other clearing member cash posted ice clear credit currently selfmanages and uses external investment managers to invest such cash margin and guaranty fund deposits 

we have an obligation to return margin payments and guaranty fund contributions to clearing members to the extent that the relevant member’s risk based on its open contracts to the clearing house is reduced if a number of clearing members 

substantially reduce their open interest or default the concentration of risks within our clearing houses will be spread among a smaller pool of clearing members which would make it more difficult to absorb and manage risk in the event of a further clearing member’s default 

although our clearing houses have policies and procedures to help ensure that clearing members can satisfy their obligations such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a members or counterparty’s default in addition although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards it is a complex process and there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect us from the risks of clearing these products we cannot assure you that these measures and safeguards will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default we have contributed our own capital to the front of the guaranty fund of the clearing houses that could be used in the event of a default furthermore the default of any one of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and cause our customers to lose confidence in the guaranty of our clearing houses 

a decline in the value of securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions by our clearing houses or default by a sovereign government issuer could pose additional risks of default by clearing members 

our clearing houses hold a substantial amount of assets as margin or guaranty fund contributions which comprise us and other sovereign treasury securities as of december 31 2018  our clearing houses held 543 billion of noncash margin or guaranty fund contributions in us and other sovereign treasury securities 415 billion of this amount was comprised of us treasury securities 18 billion of french treasury securities 17 billion of german treasury securities 12 billion of italian treasury securities 14 billion of uk treasury securities and 66 billion of other european japanese and triparty treasury securities sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest and most liquid securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived credit worthiness of major governments however the markets for such securities have experienced significant volatility during the past decade and as of late due to ongoing financial challenges in some of the major european countries and the us government’s negotiations regarding taxation spending cuts and raising the debt ceiling which is the maximum amount of debt that the us government can legally incur in addition if there is a collapse of the euro our clearing houses would face significant expenses in changing their systems and such an event could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates to mitigate this risk our clearing houses currently apply a discount or “haircut” to the market values for all sovereign securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions however market conditions could change more quickly than we adjust the amount of the haircuts and the haircuts could be insufficient in the event of a sudden market event 

notwithstanding the current intraday margin and valuation checks conducted by our clearing houses and our policies and practices to limit exposures our clearing houses will need to continue to monitor the volatility and value of sovereign treasury securities if the value of these securities declines significantly our clearing houses will need to collect additional margin or guaranty fund contributions from their clearing members which may be difficult for the members to supply in a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government in addition our clearing houses may be required to impose a more significant discount on the value of sovereign treasury securities posted as margin or guaranty fund contributions if there is uncertainty regarding the future value of these securities which would trigger the need for additional margin or guaranty fund contributions by the clearing members if a clearing member cannot supply the additional margin or guaranty fund contributions which may include cash in a currency acceptable to the clearing house the clearing house would deem the clearing member in default if any clearing members default as a result of the reduction in the value of margin or guaranty fund contributions our clearing houses and trading business could suffer substantial losses as a result of the loss of any capital that has been contributed to the clearing house’s guaranty funds and a loss of confidence by clearing members in the clearing house resulting in a reduction in volumes of future cleared transactions 

further our clearing houses invest large sums through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions in the event that a reverse repo counterparty defaults the value of the sovereign securities we hold as collateral might not be sufficient to cover our losses our clearing houses may also make demand deposits with banks that are secured only to the value of federal deposit insurance corporation or fdic insurance or other national deposit guarantee schemes which is small and therefore the deposits may in significant part be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent 

owning and operating equity and options exchanges exposes us to additional risks including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject 

owning and operating equity and options exchanges for which the revenues are primarily derived from trading activity market data and listing fees exposes us to additional risks adverse economic conditions and regulatory changes similar to those discussed above including changes to the number of exchanges that are permitted to conduct closing auctions could result in decreased trading volume on our exchanges discourage market participants from listing on our equity and options exchanges or cause them to forgo new offerings any of these could reduce our revenues including market data revenue 

our exchanges are operated as forprofit businesses but have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled specifically our exchanges are responsible for enforcing listed company compliance with applicable listing standards overseeing regulatory policy determinations rule interpretation and regulationrelated rule development and conducting trading reviews any failure by one of our exchanges with selfregulatory responsibility to comply with and enforce compliance by their members with exchange rules and securities laws could significantly harm our reputation prompt regulatory scrutiny result in the payment of fines or penalties and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we must allocate significant resources to fulfill our selfregulatory responsibilities the forprofit exchanges’ goal of maximizing stockholder value might contradict the exchanges’ selfregulatory responsibilities the listing of our common stock on the nyse could potentially create a conflict between the exchange’s regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities on the one hand and our commercial and economic interest on the other hand while we have structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful 

further changes in the rules and operations of our securities markets must be reviewed and approved by the sec approval of such changes by the sec cannot be guaranteed and the sec could delay either the approval process or the initiation of the public comment process any denial or delay in approving changes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our compliance and risk management methods as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations might not be effective which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators 

our ability to comply with complex and changing laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel regulators periodically review our exchanges’ ability to selfregulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including selfregulatory standards in particular certain of our businesses associated with the nyse group are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations policies and procedures if we fail to comply with any of these obligations regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business 

our acquisitions expose us to new regulatory requirements for example as a result of our acquisitions of interactive data and securities evaluations we operate two secregistered investment advisers investment advisers are subject to significant regulatory obligations under the investment advisers act prior to these acquisitions none of our businesses were registered under the investment advisers act compliance with the investment advisers act and other regulatory requirements gives rise to costs and expenses that may be material in addition our acquisition of the bondpoint ats in january 2018 exposes us to increased exposure to regulatory scrutiny from the sec and finra and our acquisition of tmc bonds in july 2018 exposes us to regulatory scrutiny from finra 

our regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses we will continue to face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our financial condition operating results or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business further any settlement consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or regulatory agencies begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities finally the implementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to remain competitive and grow our business 

we face intense competition 

we face intense competition in all aspects of our business and our competitors both domestic and international are numerous we currently compete with 

 trends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings finally many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and ats businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business 

we also face pricing competition in many areas of our business a decline in our fees due to competitive pressure the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for example ice data services’ business has benefited from a high renewal rate in its subscriptionbased business but we cannot assure you that this will continue we also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings modify the pricing for our products or retain our current customers or attract new customers if we are not able to compete successfully our business could be materially impacted including our ability to remain as an operating entity 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we have achieved a tremendous amount of growth since becoming a public company in 2005 our growth is highly dependent on customer demand for our core products and services favorable economic conditions and our ability to invest in our personnel facilities infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls adverse economic conditions could reduce customer demand for our products and services which may place a significant strain on our management and resources and could force us to defer existing or future planned opportunities we regularly evaluate our existing operations service capacity and business efficiencies and as a result of such evaluations we may undertake strategic initiatives outside of and within our businesses in addition we may not be successful in executing on our strategies to support our growth organically or through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances 

failure to evolve our benchmarks and indices in a manner that maintains the relevance of the benchmark or index damage to our reputation resulting from our administration of libor or other benchmarks and indices and the potential replacement of libor could adversely affect our business 

we operate multiple global benchmark products and indices across our asset classes and a significant portion of our volume is based on these products to ensure continued trading in our benchmark products and indices we must be able to demonstrate that our products are not readily subject to manipulation and we must continue to evolve our products to maintain their relevance our subsidiary iba is the administrator for various benchmarks including libor iba’s administration of libor is the result of the libor scandal which was a series of fraudulent actions taken by banks that were submitting false libor rates to profit from trades or to give the impression that the banks were more creditworthy than they were any failures negative publicity or lawsuits resulting from our administration of libor or other benchmarks could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and could harm our business and our reputation 

in january 2019 we were named as a defendant in two virtually identical proposed class action lawsuits regarding the administration of libor that allege that we and 18 multinational banks engaged in a conspiracy to set the libor benchmark at artificially low levels also in july 2017 the fca announced the desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 there is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of libor or of any particular replacement rate the federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions announced replacement of us dollar libor with a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by us treasury securities called the sofr the first publication of sofr was released in april 2018 whether or not sofr attains market traction as a libor replacement tool remains in question and the future of libor at this time is uncertain as a result it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes establishment of alternative references rates or other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the uk or elsewhere the elimination of libor or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities 

we intend to launch new products and services and continue to explore and pursue other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may spend substantial time and money developing new product offerings or improving current product offerings if these offerings are not successful we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to recover the costs of such initiatives obtaining any required regulatory approval associated with these offerings may also result in delays or restrictions on our ability to benefit fully from these offerings further we may seek to enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry introducing or maintaining our offerings in certain countries may also be subject to a number of other risks including currency exchange rate risk difficulties enforcing agreements or collecting receivables longer payment cycles compliance with the laws or regulations of these countries and political and regulatory uncertainties 

in addition in light of consolidation in the exchange data services and clearing sectors and competition for opportunities we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully our competitors could merge making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors also offering new products and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives that are necessary for our success 

we have made substantial progress toward developing and deploying new technology platforms to improve our equity exchange business and data services business we may experience disruptions or encounter unexpected challenges in deploying these new systems further the costs to complete the remaining work may exceed our current expectations any significant cost increases or disruptions to product quality sales effectiveness or client service or to our other business operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences we may not be able to compete effectively 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary and acquired technology the financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change change in use patterns change in client preferences frequent product and service introductions and the emergence of new industry standards and practices these changes could render our existing proprietary technology uncompetitive or obsolete we are in the process of implementing a new trading technology system at nyse and if there are trading disruptions or if the new system has inadequate performance we could suffer material losses incur reputational damage or be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny 

further we use some opensource software in our technology most often as small components within a larger product or service to augment algorithms functionalities or libraries we create and we may use more opensource software in the future opensource code is also contained in some thirdparty software we rely on we could be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of the license for such opensource software the terms of many opensource licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us or other courts and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology to our clients’ requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and costeffective manner any failure to remain abreast 

of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to client preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our results 

our business may be harmed by computer and communication systems failures and delays 

our business depends on the integrity reliability and security of our infrastructure which is highly dependent on our computer and communication systems we support and maintain many of the systems that comprise our electronic platforms and our failure to monitor or maintain these systems or to find replacements for defective components within a system in a timely and costeffective manner when necessary could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business our customers rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate and highquality financial market data analytics and related solutions our timely reliable delivery of highquality products and services is subject to an array of technical production processes that enable our delivery platforms to leverage an extensive range of content databases our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach our systems or those of our thirdparty providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

 we could experience system failures due to power or telecommunications failures human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyberattacks intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar events if any one or more of these situations were to arise they could result in damage to our business reputation and participant dissatisfaction with our electronic platform which could prompt participants to trade elsewhere or expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions as a consequence our business financial condition and operating results could suffer materially 

our regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in volume of order and trading transaction traffic and to provide processing and clearing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses could be adversely affected 

we currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or satisfy our debt service obligations 

as of december 31 2018 we had 74 billion of outstanding debt this level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt service obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities as we use our available resources to reduce and refinance our consolidated debt our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue future business opportunities may be further restrained in addition the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio test and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of 

liens and other matters further a portion of our outstanding debt has been in commercial paper which is subject to interest rate changes rising interest rates will result in an increase in our interest expense 

our longterm and shortterm debt is currently rated by moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s these ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time and it is possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade our credit ratings in the future in particular our inability to sustain reduced debt on a consolidated basis may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings a significant downgrade of our credit ratings could impact customers’ willingness to use our clearing houses make parties less willing to do business with us and could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase the cost of our commercial paper and any future debt funding we may obtain 

we may fail to complete or realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our recent acquisitions and future acquisitions which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we have completed many acquisitions and plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to integrate these businesses into our existing operations and realize anticipated cost savings revenue synergies and growth opportunities we generally set aggressive timelines for realizing savings   which assumes we successfully undertake a variety of actions including but not limited to integrating technology eliminating redundancies and effecting organizational restructurings that are themselves subject to a variety of risks and may be subject to regulatory approvals that we do not control the process of integrating acquired companies is time consuming and could disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties including inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants regulators and others require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of the business 

there is a risk however that we may not integrate these acquired companies in a manner that permits our expected cost savings and revenue synergies to be fully realized in the time periods expected or at all in addition a variety of factors including but not limited to regulatory conditions governmental competition approvals currency fluctuations and difficulty integrating technology platforms may adversely affect our ability to complete our acquisitions or realize our anticipated cost savings and synergies 

we may also not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures or alliances that we have entered into or may enter into for a number of reasons including regulatory or government approvals or changes global market changes contractual obligations competing products and in some instances our lack of or limited control over the management of the business further strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future 

as a result of any future acquisition we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest expend cash incur debt assume actual and contingent liabilities inherit existing or pending litigation or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets further we cannot assure you that any such financing or equity investments will be available with terms that will be favorable to us or available at all 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

since we conduct operations in several different countries including the us uk eu and canada substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling euros and canadian dollars because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

external events such as brexit and the negotiations regarding the terms thereof the passage of us taxation reform legislation and recent actions of the us administration under president donald trump each have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially among the us dollar the british pound sterling and the euro if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the uk eu the us or other 

key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further the value of the pound sterling and euro and the global credit markets may further weaken general financial instability in countries in the eu could have a contagion effect on the region and contribute to the general instability and uncertainty in the eu events that adversely affect our uk and eu clients and suppliers could in turn have a materially adverse effect on our international business results and our operating results 

for additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk refer to “ foreign currency exchange rate risk” in item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk which is included in this annual report” 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill other intangible assets or investments 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2018  we had goodwill of  131 billion  and net other intangible assets of  105 billion  relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties 

our equity investments including our investments in euroclear and coinbase global inc among others are now subject to valuation under asu 201601 in accordance with asu 201601 we will only adjust the fair value of these investments if and when there is an observable price change in an orderly transaction of a similar or identical investment or indication of impairment and any change in the fair value will be recognized in net income 

we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may result in asset impairments an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill other intangible assets and other investments and assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 

for additional information on our goodwill other intangible assets and investments refer to notes 3 4 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements and “ critical accounting policies  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets” in item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which are included in this annual report 

we may face liability for content contained in our data products and services 

we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation libel copyright or trademark infringement fraud or negligence or based on other theories of liability in each case relating to the data articles commentary ratings information or other content we distribute in our financial data services if such data or other content or information that we distribute has errors is delayed or has design defects we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our corporate website or those websites that we own and operate through links to other websites use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for significant amounts any such claim even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us could involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and a negative impact on our reputation 

in addition we license and redistribute data and content from various third parties and the terms of these licenses change frequently our thirdparty data and content suppliers may audit our use of and our clients’ use of and payment for data and content from time to time in the ordinary course of business including audits currently underway such thirdparty data and content suppliers may assert that we or our clients owe additional amounts under the terms of the applicable license agreements that we inappropriately distributed the thirdparty data or that we or our clients used the data or content in a manner that exceeded the scope of the applicable license agreement or without a license agreement we have and expect to continue to spend and allocate resources to develop and acquire the use of technology and other intellectual property rights to manage these risks and track thirdparty data usage but we cannot be assured that we will not incur liability we may incur costs to investigate any allegations and may be required to pay damages to or make unexpected settlement payments to these data and content suppliers and these costs and payments could be material 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties including trademarks service marks trade names trade secrets copyrights and patents we cannot assure you 

that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property additionally we may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively further we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights which may require significant financial and managerial resources as a result we may choose not to enforce our infringed intellectual property rights depending on our strategic evaluation and judgment regarding the best use of our resources the relative strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the recourse available to us 

in addition our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may have obtained and may be expected to obtain in the future patent and intellectual property rights related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents and intellectual property rights that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services as a result we may face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents and intellectual property rights held by others we may be subject to lawsuits or required to stop developing or marketing the products or services obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the holders of the patents and intellectual property or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patents we also could be required to pay damages if we were found to infringe patents held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

regulatory changes or court rulings may have an adverse impact on our ability to derive revenue from market data and connectivity fees 

regulatory developments or court rulings in the us could reduce the amount of revenue that we obtain from market data and connectivity fees with respect to our us equities and equity options exchanges our ability to assess fees for market data products and certain connectivity fees are subject to review by the sec there continues to be opposing industry viewpoints and litigation as to the extent that our us equities and equity options exchanges should be able to charge for market data and market access and the manner in which we set such exchange fees could be reassessed in october 2018 the sec unanimously issued an opinion setting aside certain market data fees imposed by nyse arca inc and nasdaq stock market llc which were challenged by the securities industry and financial markets association or sifma finding that the exchanges had not met their statutory obligation to demonstrate that the fees were consistent with the exchange act ie that these fees are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory simultaneously the sec remanded over 400 market data fee and other filings back to the exchanges and the national market system plans for consideration under the standards set out in the sifma order and an earlier order issued by the sec relating to a separate litigation matter 

if new constraints are placed on our ability to charge for market data it could have a negative impact on our revenues we cannot predict whether or in what form any regulatory or other changes will take effect or their impact on our business a determination by the sec or a court for example that the sec must link market data fees to marginal costs take a more active role in the market data ratesetting process or reduce the current levels of market data fees could have an adverse effect on our market data revenues 

separately our european exchanges are currently authorized to sell trade information on a nondiscriminatory basis at a reasonable cost this regulatory position could be modified or interpreted by the european commission or future european court decisions in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our european market data revenues 

we rely on thirdparty providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of an important service data or content supplied by any third party or the loss of an exclusive license could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as online service providers hosting service and software providers data processors software and hardware vendors banks local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading clearing data services and other systems we rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with third parties and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for 

the provision of hosting services we also depend on thirdparty suppliers for data and content including data received from certain competitors clients various government and public record services and financial institutions used in our products and services some of this data is exclusive to particular suppliers and may not be obtained from other suppliers in addition our data suppliers could enter into exclusive contracts with our competitors without our knowledge the general trend toward industry consolidation may increase the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future if these companies were to discontinue providing services to us for any reason or fail to provide the type of service agreed to we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients or increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines our thirdparty data suppliers perform audits on us from time to time in the ordinary course of business to determine if data we license for redistribution has been properly accounted for in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreement as a result of these audits we may incur additional expenses 

many of our clients also rely on third parties to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform if these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients’ inability to transact with our businesses we hold exclusive licenses to list various index futures and contracts in the future litigation or regulatory action may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and contracts trading to a single exchange and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license mifid ii introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of services relating to commodity derivatives across europe and the legislation requires open access to any benchmarks a benchmark is an index or other measure used to determine the value of a financial instrument for example libor or the sp 500 used in europe if unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive license were permitted we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products 

we are subject to significant litigation and liability risks 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our participants involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred for example dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platform or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades abusive trading practices security and confidentiality breaches mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants in addition because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by entering them inaccurately a large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets 

in addition we are subject to ongoing legal disputes that could result in the payment of fines penalties or damages and could expose us to additional liability in the future for example on december 19 2017 the us court of appeals for the second circuit or the second circuit issued its decision in city of providence v bats global markets et al two of our subsidiaries new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca inc are defendants in this case in vacating the district court’s dismissal of this lawsuit and remanding for further proceedings the second circuit concluded in part that the defendant securities exchanges are not immune from the claims in this case because absolute immunity is available to an sro like the new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca inc only when they carry out regulatory functions although our exchanges will continue to have other defenses available to them in securities litigation cases including in this matter limitations on the doctrine of absolute immunity could result in an increased exposure to litigation and to increased liability andor other legal expenses additionally in january 2019 two virtually identical proposed class action lawsuits were filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york asserting that various ice entities including ice benchmark administration engaged in an alleged conspiracy with the libor panel banks to set the libor benchmark at artificially low levels for the alleged purpose and effect of depressing payments by those banks to persons who engaged in interest rate transactions with the banks from february 2014 to the present while ice intends to vigorously defend these matters their outcome cannot be determined and adverse rulings could impact our financial condition and continued administration of the libor benchmark 

further we could incur significant expenses defending claims even those without merit which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us including those we are involved with due to acquisition activity may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we may have to establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered 

probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for a summary of our legal proceedings and claims 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

given our prominence in the global securities industry and the location of many of our properties and personnel in us and european financial centers including lower manhattan we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees in addition terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets including trading on exchanges any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

damage to our reputation could damage our business 

our business is highly competitive and our customers typically have options on where to conduct their business our management team and business operations benefit from being highly regarded in our industry maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and for maintaining our relationships with our regulators negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services operations risk management compliance with regulations or management team could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our existing business and business prospects 

owning and operating voice broker and electronic fixed income brokerage businesses exposes us to additional risk and these businesses are largely dependent on general market conditions 

our voice broker business provides brokerage services to clients in the form of agency transactions in commodity products in agency transactions customers pay transaction fees for trade execution services in which we connect buyers and sellers who settle their transactions directly in connection with our fixed income business our brokerdealers operate in both an agency and in a matched principal capacity also known as “riskless principal” when trading as matched principal we agree to buy instruments from one customer and sell them to another customer the amount of the fee generally depends on the spread between the buy and sell price of the security that is brokered on our platforms with respect to matched principal transactions a counterparty to a matched principal transaction may fail to fulfill its obligations or we may face liability for an unmatched trade we also face the risk of not being able to collect transaction or subscription based fees for brokerage and related services that we provide to our customers 

our success largely depends on key personnel including our senior management because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business the loss of senior management or other key personnel could harm our business 

our future performance depends in large part on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel including our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel competition for key personnel in the various localities and business segments in which we operate is intense our ability to attract and retain key personnel in particular senior management will be dependent on a number of factors including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent there is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who we rely upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives the loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel could harm our business in particular we may have to incur costs to replace senior officers or other key employees who leave and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner 

we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders principal and interest on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock is dividends from our subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results   

provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ice 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for ice these provisions make a change of control less likely which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of us and european equity exchanges for example our organizational documents include provisions that generally restrict any person either alone or together with its related persons from i voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10 of our outstanding voting capital stock including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock or ii beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock further our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to call special stockholders’ meetings or act by written consent and generally authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock in addition provisions of delaware law may have a similar effect such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders as defined under delaware law from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the board of directors 

risks to our business related to our investment in and operation of bakkt 

we may not realize the expected benefits of our majority investment in bakkt and the investment may introduce additional risks to our business due to its newly developed and evolving business model 

on august 3 2018 we formed a new company bakkt llc along with a group of organizations we have a majority ownership interest in bakkt bakkt intends to create an integrated platform that enables consumers and institutions to transact in digital assets and plans to include regulated trading clearing and custodial solutions for digital assets due to our majority ownership interest in bakkt we have increased financial and reputational risks if there is a failure to launch or if the launch of this new business is unsuccessful also there can be no assurance that we will receive the necessary regulatory approvals and support from customers to launch bakkt as planned or that bakkt will operate as anticipated or that we will realize the expected return on our investment we regularly evaluate our existing operations service capacity and business efficiencies and as a result of such evaluations we may undertake strategic initiatives outside of and within our businesses as a result it may take longer than expected for us to realize the expected returns from this investment or such returns may ultimately be less than anticipated furthermore our investment in bakkt entails numerous risks including risks relating to bakkt’s ability to 

 as digital assets and blockchain technologies become more widely available bakkt expects the services and products associated with them to continue to develop and evolve as a result from time to time bakkt may add modify or discontinue certain aspects of its business model relating to the product mix and service offerings future additions and modifications to bakkt’s business will increase the complexity of its business and place significant strain on our and bakkt’s management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we cannot offer any assurance that these or any other additions or modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to bakkt’s or our business 

distributed ledger technology is relatively new and we believe that the application of distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets is novel to the proposed bakkt systems and accordingly we have limited experience applying distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets the creation and operation of an exchange for the transfer of digital assets utilizing a distributed ledger to enable consumers and institutions to confirm that the blockchain underlying these digital assets has not been altered is subject to potential technical legal and regulatory constraints any problems that bakkt encounters with the operation of the bakkt systems including technical legal and regulatory problems could have a material adverse effect on its business and plan of operations 

hiring qualified and experienced personnel in this specialized technology space is difficult due to the high level of competition and scarcity of experience bakkt may have difficulty finding hiring and integrating qualified employees this could put a strain on existing ice employees and delay the work that these employees are performing for ice and ice’s subsidiaries in addition any potential issues or major decisions involving bakkt may divert the attention of management and resources from matters that are core or critical to ice’s business 

we anticipate that at the time of its launch bakkt will be dependent solely on trading volume from one product offering bakkts bitcoin futures contract for its clearing and transaction fee revenues and profits failure to establish the trading volume in bakkts bitcoin futures contract or any subsequent products released by bakkt would negatively impact bakkts business financial condition and operating results and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

digital currency custodial solutions and related technology including bakkt’s systems and custodial arrangements are subject to risks related to a loss of funds due to theft of cryptocurrencies employee or vendor sabotage security and cybersecurity risks system failures and other operational issues and a lack of sufficient insurance which could cause damage to our reputation and brand and bakkt’s reputation and brand 

bakkts systems and custodial solutions involve the processing storage and transmission of cryptocurrencies and data while bakkt will contractually limit the amount of exposure it will have in the event that the cryptocurrencies are stolen or misappropriated we cannot guarantee that these limits will protect us from additional liability and other damage the theft or misappropriation of cryptocurrencies held in custody by bakkt would likely result in financial loss reputational damage potential lack of trust from our customers in other business lines negative press coverage and diversion of management’s time and focus the secure storage and transmission of cryptocurrencies and data over networks will be a critical element of bakkt’s operations despite the defensive measures bakkt may take these threats may come from external factors such as governments organized crime hackers and other third parties such as outsourced or infrastructuresupport providers and application developers or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom bakkt has granted access to its systems 

cryptocurrency transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies may be irretrievable once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain an incorrect transfer of a cryptocurrency generally will not be reversible and bakkt may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft it is possible that through computer or human error or through theft or criminal action the cryptocurrency could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties or to uncontrolled accounts such events would have a material adverse effect on the ability of bakkt to continue as a going concern which would have a material adverse effect on our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

although the cryptocurrencies held by bakkt are insured bakkt may lose cryptocurrencies valued in excess of the insurance policy without any recourse unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions in the event of loss or loss of utility value there is no public insurer such as the securities investor protection corporation or the fdic to offer recourse to bakkt or to any investor and the misappropriated cryptocurrencies cannot easily be traced to the bad actor 

further when cryptocurrency custodial solutions or transfer venues whether involving bakkt systems or others experience system failures or other operational issues such events could result in a reduction in cryptocurrency prices or confidence and impact the success of bakkt and have a material adverse effect on the ability of bakkt to continue as a going concern 

regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of our majority ownership interest in bakkt or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects bakkt’s business prospects or operations and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

as cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies with certain governments deeming them illegal and others allowing their use and trade ongoing and future regulatory actions may impact the ability of bakkt to continue to operate and such actions could affect the ability 

of bakkt to continue as a going concern which would have a material adverse effect on the business prospects or operations of bakkt and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

the cftc designated bitcoin as a commodity and as such exchangetraded derivatives involving bitcoin are subject to the cftcs jurisdiction and enforcement powers although the cftc has suggested it is not particularly focused on pursuing such enforcement at this time and in fact there may be some limits on its ability to do so without a specific connection to commodities derivatives markets in the event that the cftc does pursue such enforcement and ultimately shuts down an exchange on which bakkt’s bitcoin futures contract is traded it may have a significant adverse impact on bakkts business and plan of operations and consequently our majority ownership interest in bakkt 

governments may in the future curtail or outlaw the acquisition use or redemption of cryptocurrencies ownership of holding or trading in cryptocurrencies may then be considered illegal and subject to sanction governments may also take regulatory action that may increase the cost andor subject cryptocurrency companies to additional regulation

 business environment and market trends 

our business environment has been characterized by 

 price volatility increases the need to hedge risk and creates demand among market participants for the exchange of risk through trading and clearing market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market’s strength in addition the ability to evolve existing products to serve emerging needs develop new products and respond to competitive dynamics in pricing exclusivity and consolidation is important to our business 

recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets centralized clearing and access to data all of which are important aspects of our product offering however some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered in addition some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several of the mifid ii regulations are inconsistent with us rules as the evolution continues legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data as a result it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us as discussed more fully in item 1 “ business  regulation” included in this annual report brexit the implementation of mifid ii and other regulations may result in operational regulatory andor business risk 

in recent years low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a relatively slow economic recovery lower growth in asia and the eu may also continue to affect global financial markets in addition economic and regulatory uncertainty coupled with periods of high market volatility around geopolitical events low interest rates and low natural gas prices has affected our clients’ activities in recent years the duration of these trends will determine the continued impact on our business 

we have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class in addition we have increased our portion of nontransaction and clearing revenues from 39 in 2014 to 56 in 2018 this nontransaction revenue includes data services and listings 

many of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels we anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends including the following 

 we continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams as well as on our companywide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data clearing and markets 

segment results 

our business is conducted through two reportable business segments 

 while revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of both segments we use a prorata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment further we did not allocate expenses to specific revenue streams within these segments since such an allocation is not reasonably possible our two segments do not engage in intersegment transactions 

trading and clearing segment 

the following presents selected statements of income data for our trading and clearing segment dollars in millions 

1 the adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance as a result these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with us gaap see “ nongaap financial measures” below 



transaction and clearing revenues 

our transaction and clearing revenues are reported on a net basis except for the nyse transactionbased expenses discussed below and consist of fees collected from our derivatives fixed income cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing in our derivatives markets we earn transaction and clearing revenues from both counterparties to each contract that is traded andor cleared and in our equity and equity options markets we receive trade execution fees as well as routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution 

rates percontract or rpc are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract net of certain rebates our percontract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors including but not limited to market conditions transaction and clearing volume product mix pricing applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements and new product introductions because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a percontract basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and due to product mix 

in 2018  2017  and 2016  20 20 and 19 respectively of our trading and clearing segment revenues less transactionbased expenses were billed in pounds sterling or euros due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro over the last two years compared to the us dollar our trading and clearing segment revenues less transactionbased expenses were higher by 18 million in 2018  from 2017  and were lower by 14 million in 2017  from 2016  

our transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates we recorded rebates of 844 million 749 million and 674 million in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded the increase in the rebates is due primarily to an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts an increase in our traded volume and an increase in the number of rebate programs 

 total oil volume increased 3 in 2018  from 2017  and increased 14 in 2017  from 2016  ice brent crude futures and options volume was flat in 2018  from 2017  and increased 15 in 2017  from 2016  ice wti crude futures and options volume increased 5 in 2018  from 2017  and increased 14 in 2017  from 2016  the volume increases were primarily due to increased oil price volatility related to shifting supply and demand dynamics globally broader market volatility in oil products equities and foreign exchange rates acts of central governments outcomes of elections and uncertainty around the organization of petroleum exporting countries or opec policy our record gasoil futures and options volume in 2018  increased 11 from 2017  and increased 13 in 2017  from 2016  gasoil futures and options increased during 2018  and 2017  primarily due to increased demand for distillates strong economic activity in europe and asia and regulatory uncertainty 

our global natural gas futures and options volume decreased 4 in 2018  from 2017  and decreased 1 in 2017  from 2016  the volume decrease in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to lower us price volatility reducing our commercial customers’ need to hedge the henry hub contract and depressed gas prices driven by a continued surplus of natural gas during 2018  as compared to 2017  our 2018 henry hub natural gas volume decrease was partially offset by increased volumes in our north american basis market and ttf gas in europe our record ttf gas volumes in 2018 were driven by changing natural gas dynamics due to the continued globalization of natural gas emission futures and options volumes increased 73 in 2018  from 2017  and increased 1 in 2017  from 2016  our record emissions volumes in 2018 were driven by higher carbon prices and supplydemand dynamics impacted by regulatory uncertainty 

 other financial futures and options volume decreased 9 in 2018  from 2017  and decreased 19 in 2017  from 2016  the decrease was primarily due to the termination of our exclusive license to list futures and options contracts on the russell ®  indices excluding the futures and options contracts on the russell ®  indices other financial futures and options volume increased 18 in 2018  from 2017  other financial futures and options revenues were 124 million 133 million and 141 million in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 



2018 commencement of trading of nyse national and the july 2018 acquisition of chx cash equities handled volume decreased 17 in 2017  from 2016  primarily due to reduced us equities market volatility during 2017 as compared to 2016  cash equities revenues net of transactionbased expenses were 220 million 196 million and 223 million in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

equity options volume increased 43 in 2018  from 2017  primarily due to heightened volatility in the us equity markets as well as increased market share in 2018 due to greater volatility equity options volume decreased 13 in 2017  from 2016 primarily due to lower us equity market volatility and the restructuring of the nyse american options business equity options revenues net of transactionbased expenses were 107 million 90 million and 98 million in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively

for nyse cash equities market share increased in 2018 due to increased equity market volatility the commencement of trading on nyse national and the acquisition of chx nyse cash equities market share declined during 2017 due to historically low volatility driving more trading to offexchange trading venues particularly darkpools for nyse equity options 2018 market share improved due to greater equity market volatility and decreased in 2017 due to a strategic focus on maximizing revenues in an extremely competitive environment 

transactionbased expenses 

our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue these section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government’s costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals we in turn collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced the activity assessment fees are designed to equal the section 31 fees as a result activity assessment fees and the corresponding section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income although the timing of payment by us may vary from collections the fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the sec semiannually as required the total amount is included in accrued liabilities and was 105 million as of december 31 2018  

we make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers as well as routing charges made to other exchanges included in transactionbased expenses we incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges in that case we route the customer’s order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer the external market center charges us a fee per share denominated in tenths of a cent per share for routing to its system we record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue 

operating expenses operating income and operating margin 

our trading and clearing segment operating expenses increased 130 million in 2018  from 2017  and decreased 45 million in 2017  from 2016  partially related to the 33 million creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense recorded in 2016 see “ consolidated operating expenses” below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses our trading and clearing segment operating income increased 162 million in 2018  from 2017  and increased 71 million in 2017  from 2016  trading and clearing segment operating margins were 62  63  and 61  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the operating income increases in the last two years were driven by the revenue increases discussed above 

our trading and clearing segment adjusted operating expenses were 824 million  714 million  and 716 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively our trading and clearing segment adjusted operating income was 16 billion  14 billion  and 14 billion  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively our trading and clearing segment adjusted operating margins were 66  in 2018  2017  and 2016  see “ nongaap financial measures” below

1 the adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance as a result these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with us gaap see “ nongaap financial measures” below 



data services revenues 

our data and listings segment represents subscriptionbased or recurring revenues from data services and listings services offered across our trading and clearing businesses and ice data services through ice data services we generate revenues from a range of global financial and commodity markets including pricing and reference data exchange data analytics feeds index services desktops and connectivity solutions through nyse nyse american and nyse arca we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and etfs and related corporate actions for listed companies 

in 2018  2017  and 2016  8 10 and 12 respectively of our data and listings segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros all relating to our data services revenues as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes the us equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly due to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro during 2018  our data services revenues were higher by 7 million in 2018  than in 2017  due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro compared to the us dollar during 2017  our data services revenues were lower by 8 million in 2017  than in 2016  

our data services revenues are primarily subscriptionbased and increased 1 in 2018  from 2017  and increased 5 in 2017  from 2016  the increases in revenues in both 2018  and 2017  were primarily due to the strong retention rate of 

existing customers the addition of new customers increased purchases by existing customers and increases in pricing of our products partially offset by the divestitures of idms in march 2017 and trayport in december 2017 within our desktop and connectivity business the increase in revenue in 2017  from 2016  was also partially due to our acquisitions of tmx atrium in may 2017 and bofamls global research division’s index business in october 2017 and the impact of foreign currency translation 

 annual subscription value or asv represents at a point in time the data services revenues subscribed for the succeeding 12 months asv does not include new sales contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12month period asv also does not include certain data services revenue streams that are not subscriptionbased revenue from asv businesses has historically represented approximately 90 of our data revenues thus while it is an indicative forwardlooking metric it does not provide a growth forecast of the next 12 months of data services revenues 

as of december 31 2018  asv was 1922 billion which increased 61 compared to the asv as of december 31 2017  this does not adjust for yearoveryear foreign exchange fluctuations or impacts of acquisitions underpinning this growth is strength in our pricing  analytics business 

listings revenues 

listings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges  original listing fees and annual listing fees original listing fees consist of two components initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions initial listing fees subject to a minimum and maximum amount are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists all listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over a two year period with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges which is generally estimated to be over a period of up to nine years for nyse and up to five years for nyse arca and nyse american 

in addition we earn corporate actionsrelated listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares such as stock splits rights issues and sales of additional securities as well as mergers and acquisitions listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges which is generally estimated to be a period of   six years for nyse and three years for nyse arca and nyse american 

our listings revenues increased 4 in 2018 from 2017 and decreased 1 in 2017 from 2016 due to changes in market conditions for ipos 

operating expenses operating income and operating margin 

our data and listings segment operating expenses increased 7 million in 2018  from 2017  and decreased 36 million in 2017  from 2016  see “ consolidated operating expenses” below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses our data and listings segment operating income increased 42 million in 2018  from 2017  and increased 136 million in 2017  from 2016  our data and listings segment operating margins were 42  41  and 37  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the operating income and operating margin increases during 2018  and 2017  were driven by the revenue increases discussed above 

our data and listings segment adjusted operating expenses were 12 billion  in 2018  2017  and 2016  our data and listings segment adjusted operating income was 13 billion  13 billion  and 12 billion  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively our data and listings segment adjusted operating margins were 51  51  and 49  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively see “ nongaap financial measures” below 

consolidated operating expenses 

the following presents our consolidated operating expenses dollars in millions 



the majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance 

we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with our acquisitions and growth of our business and to vary from yeartoyear based on the type and level of our acquisitions our integrations and other investments 

in 2018  2017  and 2016  13 14 and 18 respectively of our operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros due to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro in 2018 our consolidated operating expenses were higher by 12 million in 2018  than in 2017  due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro as compared to the us dollar in 2017  our consolidated operating expenses were lower by 14 million in 2017  than in 2016  see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk” below for additional information 

compensation and benefits expenses 

compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes noncapitalized employee wages bonuses noncash or stock compensation certain severance costs benefits and employer taxes the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance the performancebased restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance therefore our compensation and benefits expense will vary yeartoyear based on our financial performance and fluctuations in the number of employees 

as of december 31 2018  we had 5161 employees compared to 4952 and 5631 as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively our employee headcount increased in 2018  from 2017  primarily due to new employees related to the acquisitions of bondpoint in january 2018 chx holdings inc and tmc bonds in july 2018 and mers in october 2018 partially offset by continued employee terminations associated with our integration of interactive data our employee headcount decreased in 2017  from 2016  primarily due to the divestitures in 2017  of idms trayport and nyse governance services and employee terminations in connection with our integration of interactive data partially offset by new employees related to the acquisitions of ice ngx and tmx atrium in 2017  see “ recent developments” above 

our compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2018  from 2017  primarily due to employee severance and retention costs and a net increase in our employee headcount partially offset by a decrease in noncash compensation expense we incurred employee severance and retention costs of 41 million 21 million and 10 million in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the decrease in compensation and benefits expenses in 2017  from 2016  was minimal 

noncash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were 130 million 135 million and 123 million in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the decrease in noncash compensation expenses in 2018  from 2017  was primarily related to a change in ice’s noncash incentive plans that reduced the overall amount of noncash incentives awarded the increase in noncash compensation expenses in 2017  from 2016  primarily relates to the integration of the interactive data employees into the ice noncash incentive plans 

professional services expenses 

this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives temporary labor as well as regulatory legal and accounting fees and may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services temporary labor and regulatory accounting and legal proceedings 

professional services expenses increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to consulting and legal fees related to software development consulting costs professional services expenses decreased in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to the continued reduction in professional services and contractors at nyse we eliminated or replaced certain contractor positions with fulltime employees at nyse in 2016 in addition during 2016 we recorded a credit from a thirdparty service provider related to fees charged in a prior period legal fees which are included in professional services expenses primarily related to class action lawsuits in which nyse was a defendant these decreases were partially offset by professional services expenses incurred by interactive data trayport securities evaluations and credit market analysis 

acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs 

in 2018  we incurred 34 million  in acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs primarily relating to employee terminations and lease terminations in connection with our our integrations of interactive data securities evaluations and 

credit market analysis professional services costs from our 2018 acquisitions and a 5 million banker success fee in connection with our acquisition of tmc bonds the integration of interactive data was completed by june 30 2018 

in 2017  we incurred 36 million  in acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs primarily relating to our integrations of interactive data securities evaluations and credit market analysis and our acquisitions of bondpoint tmx atrium the ice bofaml indices and nyse national of this amount 11 million was primarily related to the acquisitions we incurred 25 million for interactive data securities evaluations and credit market analysis integration costs relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs

we expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth as a result we may incur acquisitionrelated transaction costs in future periods see “ nongaap financial measures” below 

technology and communication expenses 

technology support services consist of costs for running our whollyowned data centers hosting costs paid to thirdparty data centers and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity these costs are driven by system capacity functionality and redundancy requirements communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms telecommunications costs and fees paid for access to external market data this expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume our capacity requirements changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly 

technology and communications expenses increased in 2018  from 2017  primarily due to 17 million in data center migrations hardware support upgrades and cybersecurity investments 11 million in increased costs related to our recent acquisitions net of divestitures and 7 million in increased costs for external market data content acquisition and revenue share agreements related to our product offering technology and communications expenses increased in 2017  from 2016  primarily due to 14 million in increased hardware support upgrades and cybersecurity investments and 10 million in costs related to our recent acquisitions net of divestitures 

rent and occupancy expenses 

rent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent maintenance real estate taxes utilities and other related costs we have significant operations located in and around atlanta new york and london with smaller offices located throughout the world see item 2 “ properties” above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property 

excluding the impact of the acquisitions rent and occupancy expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to reduced rent and occupancy costs realized from the continued consolidation of our atlanta new york and london office locations 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses include marketing advertising public relations insurance bank service charges dues and subscriptions travel and entertainment nonincome taxes and other general and administrative costs 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased in 2018  from 2017  primarily due to 14 million in accruals relating to sec investigations and inquiries made during 2017  selling general and administrative expenses increased in 2017  from 2016  primarily due to the acquisitions of securities evaluations and credit market analysis and 14 million in accruals relating to sec investigations and inquiries excluding the impact of acquisitions and the sec investigations and inquiries selling general and administrative expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to lower marketing expenses refer to note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for more information on the sec investigations and inquiries 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of longlived assets such as buildings leasehold improvements planes furniture fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses as well as on various licensing agreements over their estimated useful lives intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships trading products with finite lives and technology this expense also includes amortization of internallydeveloped and purchased software over its estimated useful life 

we recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions as well as on other intangible assets of 289 million 272 million and 323 million in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively amortization expense increased in 2018  from 2017  as a result of ice ngx bondpoint tmc bonds the ice bofaml indices mers and tmx atrium intangible assets in addition in 2018  we recorded a 4 million impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets related to our closure of ice futures canada and ice clear canada as amortization expense this increase in amortization expense was partially offset by a decrease in amortization recorded on our russell license intangible assets in 2018  from 2017  due to these assets becoming fully amortized and amortization expense recorded in 2017  as a result of the net loss of 6 million on the sale of nyse governance services 

the decrease in the amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets in 2017  from 2016  is primarily due to a reduction in amortization expenses recorded on intangible assets which became fully amortized primarily related to certain of the nyse intangible assets and the divestitures of trayport and nyse governance services partially offset by amortization expenses recorded on the securities evaluations credit market analysis ice ngx and tmx atrium intangible assets in 2016  we recorded an impairment of the creditex customer relationship intangible asset of 33 million which was recorded in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2016  we sold certain of creditex’s us voice brokerage operations to tullett prebon and discontinued creditex’s uk voice brokerage operations we continue to operate creditex’s electronically traded markets and systems posttrade connectivity platforms and intellectual property 

we recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of 293 million 257 million and 254 million in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively with the increase in 2018 primarily due to depreciation resulting from increased software development 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating the following tables present our nonoperating income expenses dollars in millions 



interest income 

we recognized interest income on our investments of 22 million 8 million and 3 million during 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively interest income increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to a rise in shortterm interest rates on various investments 

interest expense 

interest expense increased in 2018  from 2017  primarily due to an increase in the principal and coupon of our bond refinancing in august 2018 as well as a rise in shortterm interest rates impacting our commercial paper program interest expense increased in 2017  from 2016  primarily due to interest expense that we recognized relating to our bond refinancing in august 2017 partially offset by the september 2017 repayment of 850 million of 200 senior unsecured fixed rate notes that were due in october 2017 see “ debt” below 

other income net 

in december 2017 we sold trayport to tmx group for £550 million   733 million  we recognized a net gain of 110 million  on the divestiture of trayport which was recorded as other income in 2017  

in connection with cetip’s merger with bmfbovespa sa now b3 and its subsequent sale we recognized a 176 million realized investment gain in other income in 2017  and 9 million in foreign exchange losses and transaction expenses in other expense in 2017  we recognized dividend income received relating to our investment in cetip in other income which was 5 million and 17 million in 2017  and 2016  respectively we no longer receive dividends from cetip subsequent to its sale in the first quarter of 2017 

we account for our investments in the options clearing corporation or occ and mers until our october 2018 acquisition of mers as equity method investments we recognized 46 million 36 million and 25 million in equity income related to these investments during 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively as other income prior to october 2018 we owned a majority stake in mers and treated it as an equity method investment because we did not have the ability to control its operations on october 3 2018 we completed the purchase of all remaining interests of mers and subsequently own 100 of mers on that date we gained control of mers began to include merss results as part of our consolidated operations and recognized a 110 million  gain on our initial investment value in mers as other income mers is now part of ice mortgage services 

in connection with our equity investment in euroclear we recognized dividend income of 15 million in 2018  which is included in other income 

in connection with our adoption of asu 201707 we are recognizing the other components of net benefit cost of our defined 

benefit plans in the income statement as nonoperating income on a full retrospective basis the combined net periodic expense benefit of these plans was 8 million and 9 million in 2018  and 2017  respectively 

we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of 2 million 4 million and 1 million in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively this was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income net when the settlement of foreign currency assets liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in nonfunctional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the periodend foreign currency exchange rates between periods see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk” included elsewhere in this annual report for more information on these items 

noncontrolling interest 

for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100 and for which we have control over the assets liabilities and management of the entity the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2016 noncontrolling interests included those related to the operating results of our cds clearing subsidiaries in which nonice limited partners held a 425 net profit sharing interest ice endex in which gasunie held a 21 ownership interest and ice clear netherlands in which abn amro clearing held a 25 ownership interest 

in 2017 we purchased both gasunie’s 21 interest in ice endex and abn amro clearing’s 25 interest in ice clear netherlands subsequent to these acquisitions we own 100 of ice endex and ice clear netherlands and no longer include any noncontrolling interest related to either company in our consolidated financial statements in addition in 2017 we purchased 126 of the net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries from several nonice limited partners and the remaining partners held a 299 net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 

during september 2018 we purchased a 32 interest in a nonice limited partner of our cds clearing subsidiaries and the remaining nonice limited partners hold a 267 ownership interest as of december 31 2018  as of december 31 2018  there are no other noncontrolling interests included in our consolidated financial statements other than that related to the nonice partners in bakkt refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 

in december 2018 bakkt llc or bakkt a newly formed entity was capitalized with 183 million  in initial funding by us as majority owner along with a group of other minority investors we hold a call option over these interests subject to certain terms similarly the nonice partners in bakkt hold a put option to require us to repurchase their interests subject to certain 

terms these minority interests are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests in temporary equity within our consolidated balance sheet 

consolidated income tax provision 

consolidated income tax expense benefit was 500 million   28 million  and 586 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the change in consolidated income tax expense benefit between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pretax income and the changes in our effective tax rate each year our effective tax rate was 20  1  and 29  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the effective tax rate in 2018  is lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the enactment of the tcja which reduced the us corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  effective january 1 2018 the 2018 effective tax rate was further reduced due to tax benefits from the acquisition of mers deferred tax benefits from changes in estimates and additional tax benefits associated with our sale of trayport in 2017 see “ recent developments” above the effective tax rates in 2017  and 2016  are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable us and uk tax law changes and favorable foreign income tax rate differentials partially offset by state income taxes favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower income tax rates in the uk and various other lower tax jurisdictions as compared to the historical income tax rates in the us 

the reductions in us and uk corporate income tax rates resulted in deferred tax benefits in the respective periods of enactment the impact of the deferred tax benefits for the us and uk corporate income tax rate reductions in 2017  and 2016  lowered the effective tax rates by 30  and 2  respectively and resulted in deferred tax benefits of 764 million  and 34 million  respectively 

the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017  from 2016  is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with the future us income tax rate reduction and tax benefits associated with a divestiture in the second quarter of 2017 partially offset by the deferred tax benefit from the uk corporate income tax reduction in the third quarter of 2016 additional tax expense from an illinois corporate income tax rate increase enacted in the third quarter of 2017 and an income tax expense increase due to a relatively higher us mix of income in 2017 see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included in this annual report for additional information on these tax items 

quarterly results of operations 

the following quarterly unaudited consolidated statements of income data have been prepared on substantially the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations for the quarters presented the historical results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for any future period this unaudited condensed consolidated quarterly data should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report the following table sets forth quarterly consolidated statements of income data in millions 





1 other income expense net includes the following a 110 million gain in connection with our acquisition of mers see “ recent developments” above a 110 million gain on our sale of trayport for the three months ended december 31 2017 and in connection with the cetip merger and its subsequent sale 9 million in foreign tax losses and transaction expenses for the three months ended june 30 2017 and a 176 million realized investment gain for the three months ended march 31 2017 

2 the decrease in the income tax expenses for the three months ended december 31 2017 is primarily due to a 764 million deferred tax benefit associated with future us income tax reductions and the decrease for the three months ended june 30 2017 is primarily due to the tax benefit associated with a divestiture see “ consolidated income tax provision” above 

liquidity and capital resources 

below are charts that reflect our capital allocation the acquisition and integration costs in the chart below includes cash paid for acquisitions net of cash received for divestitures cash paid for investments cash paid for noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest and the acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs net of divestitures in each year 

we have financed our operations growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures working capital strategic acquisitions and investments stock repurchases dividends and the development of our technology platforms we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt but we may also need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities in the future see “ future capital requirements” below 

see “ recent developments” above for a discussion of the acquisitions and investments that we made during 2018  these acquisitions and investments were initially funded from borrowing under our commercial paper program along with cash flows from operations and subsequently refinanced with our 2018 debt issuance 

our commercial paper program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable shortterm interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to delever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities we repaid a net amount of 283 million  under our commercial paper program during 2018  

upon maturity of our commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper to mitigate this risk we maintain an undrawn backstop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper program if we were not able to issue new commercial paper we have the option of drawing on the backstop revolving 

facility however electing to do so would result in higher interest expense for a discussion of our commercial paper program and other indebtedness see “ debt” below 

consolidated cash and cash equivalents were 724 million  and 535 million  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively we had 11 billion  and 10 billion  in shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively we consider all shortterm highlyliquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents we classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as shortterm investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as longterm investments shortterm and longterm investments are included in other current and other noncurrent assets respectively cash and cash equivalents that are not available for general use either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements are classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments 

as of december 31 2018  the amount of unrestricted cash held by our nonus subsidiaries was 253 million due to us tax reform a significant amount of 2018 currentyear undistributed earnings within our nonus subsidiaries in excess of their unrestricted cash balance have been subject to the global intangible lowtaxed income provisions under the tcja accordingly these earnings have been subject to immediate us income taxation and any nonus unrestricted cash balances can be distributed to the us in the future with no material additional income tax consequences 

our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of nonspeculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash such as overnight deposits term deposits money market funds mutual funds for treasury investments short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets we may invest a portion of our cash in excess of shortterm operating needs in investmentgrade marketable debt securities including government or governmentsponsored agencies and corporate debt securities 

repurchases of our common stock may be made from time to time on the open market through established trading plans in privatelynegotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with all applicable securities laws rules and regulations in 2018  2017  and 2016  we repurchased 163 million  shares 150 million  shares and 09 million  shares respectively of our outstanding common stock at a cost of 12 billion  949 million  and 50 million  respectively the shares repurchased are held in treasury stock and were completed on the open market and under rule 10b51 trading plans 

from time to time we enter into rule 10b51 trading plans as authorized by our board of directors to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock the timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a rule 10b51 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions in making a determination regarding any stock repurchases management considers multiple factors including overall stock market conditions our common stock price movements the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board of directors the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings our expected free cash flow and working capital needs our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources 

in august 2016 our board of directors approved an aggregate of 10 billion  for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date in september 2017 our board of directors approved an aggregate of 12 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective on january 1 2018 in september 2018 our board of directors approved an aggregate of 20 billion  for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective january 1 2019 we expect this authorization to provide us with capacity for buybacks over six quarters and flexibility to act opportunistically we expect funding for any share repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our commercial paper program or our debt facilities 

we may discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate a rule 10b51 trading plan at any time the approval of our board of directors for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock in addition our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time 

cash flow 

the following table presents the major components of net changes in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents in millions 



in the fourth quarter of 2017 we adopted a new accounting standard fasb asu 201618 which requires that the changes in the total cash cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents be reflected in the statement of cash flows as a result we no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents in our statement of cash flows we have reclassified changes in restricted cash from cash flows provided by used in investing activities to the total change in beginning and endofyear total changes our statements of cash flows for 2018 2017 and 2016 reflect this change 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital 

the 448 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2018  from 2017  is primarily a result of the increase in our net income excluding our net noncash adjustments fluctuations in our working capital less cash paid for income taxes in 2018  than in 2017  and a 136 million contribution that was made to our pension plan in 2017 the noncash adjustments include our mers investment gain of 110 million during 2018  as well as our deferred tax benefit of 764 million due to tax reform our gain on the sale of our cetip investment of 114 million and our trayport gain of 110 million during 2017  the 136 million contribution to our pension plan in 2017 allowed us to reach 99 funding of our pension obligation and allowed us to immunize the liability against future market fluctuations for additional information on our pension plan refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

the 64 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2017  from 2016  is primarily due to the 136 million pension plan contribution in 2017 compared to a 10 million contribution in 2016 

investing activities 

consolidated net cash provided by used in investing activities in 2018  2017  and 2016  primarily relates to cash paid for acquisitions cash received from divestitures net cash received from the sale of our investment in cetip purchases of investments proceeds from term deposits and changes in capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs

the following summarizes significant developments and changes associated with our debt 

amended credit facility 

we have a  34 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement with wells fargo bank na as primary administrative agent issuing lender and swingline lender bank of america na as syndication agent backup administrative agent and swingline lender and the lenders party thereto on august 9 2018 we extended the final maturity date of the credit facility from august 18 2022 to august 9 2023 and made certain other changes herein referred to as the amended credit facility

commercial paper program 

we have a us dollar commercial paper program or the commercial paper program it is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the amended credit facility as described above the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from shortterm interest rates such as usd libor which fluctuate due to market conditions and as a result may impact our interest expense 

we repaid a net amount of 283 million  of outstanding commercial paper during 2018  using cash flows from operations and cash proceeds received from our 2018 bond issuance we repaid 409 million of net notes outstanding under the program during 2017 primarily using cash proceeds received from the sales of cetip and trayport these reductions were partially offset by notes we issued under the program during 2017 the proceeds of which were used to fund acquisitions and investments and repurchase our common stock we used net proceeds from notes issued under the program during 2016 for the acquisitions of securities evaluations and credit market analysis and for general corporate purposes we repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the program during 2018 2017 and 2016 with cash flows from operations

future capital requirements 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate of growth across our trading and clearing and data and listings segments strategic plans and acquisitions available sources for financing activities required and discretionary technology and clearing initiatives regulatory requirements the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products the geographic mix of our business and potential stock repurchases 

we currently expect to incur capital expenditures including operational and real estate capital expenditures and to incur software development costs that are eligible for capitalization ranging in the aggregate between 290 million and 320 million in 2019 which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology business integration and the continued growth of our businesses 

in september 2018 our board of directors approved an aggregate of 20 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective on january 1 2019 we expect this authorization to provide us with capacity for buybacks over six quarters and flexibility to act opportunistically refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional details on our stock repurchase plans 

our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend policy providing that dividends will be approved quarterly by the board or its audit committee taking into account factors such as our evolving business model prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements without a predetermined net income payout ratio during 2018  we paid cash dividends of 096  per share of our common stock in the aggregate including quarterly dividends of 024 per share for an aggregate payout of 555 million  which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years for the first quarter of 2019 we announced a 0275 per share dividend payable on march 29 2019 to stockholders of record as of march 15 2019

nongaap measures 

we use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent gaap measures or that supplement the information provided by our gaap measures we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance 

we use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance including in this annual report and believe that these measures when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than gaap measures alone in addition we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making periodtoperiod comparisons of results because the adjustments to gaap are not reflective of our core business performance 

these financial measures are not presented in accordance with or as an alternative to gaap financial measures and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies we encourage investors to review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report including our consolidated financial statements to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons 

the table below outlines our adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income attributable to ice common stockholders and adjusted earnings per share which are nongaap measures that are calculated by making adjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core business 

performance these measures including the adjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments in millions except for percentages and per share amounts are as follows 



acquisitionrelated transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses except for those that are directly related to the announcement closing financing or termination of a transaction however we adjust for the acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs relating to interactive data and nyse given the sizes of these acquisitions the integration of nyse was completed by june 2016 and the integration of interactive data was completed by june 2018 amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles are included in nongaap adjustments as excluding these noncash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results 

in addition we also include the following items as nongaap adjustments as each of these are not considered a part of our core business operations 

 the tax items in nongaap adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pretax nongaap adjustments or tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance the following taxrelated items are included as nongaap adjustments 

 for additional information on these items refer to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and “ recent developments” “ consolidated operating expenses” “ consolidated nonoperating income expenses” and “consolidated income tax provision” above

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following presents our contractual obligations which we intend to fund from existing cash as well as cash flow from operations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2018  in millions 



purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments listed above 640 billion in cash margin deposits guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund the cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them ice ngx administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts it has an equal and offsetting claim to and from its respective participants on opposite sides of the physicallysettled contract each of which is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable 

we have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits or utbs as of december 31 2018  our cumulative utbs were 98 million interest and penalties related to utbs were 28 million as of december 31 2018  we are under examination by various tax authorities we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax interest and penalties if any that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our utbs 

as of december 31 2018  in connection with our acquisition of nyse we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs the date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs

in 2016 the sec approved a plan to establish a marketwide consolidated audit trail or cat to improve regulators’ ability to monitor trading activity in 2018 the first phase of implementation went live and required participants to begin reporting to the cat with a phased implementation of the provisions of the cat through 2019 funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the execution venues and industry members to date however funding has been provided solely by the execution venues in exchange for promissory notes expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the sec and are collected to fund the cat 

new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report  for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us 

critical accounting policies 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “ 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and reevaluate them on a periodic basis based on these factors we make estimates and judgments about among other things the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies among others affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results assets and liabilities 

goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 

assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets including identified intangible assets we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles such as customer relationships trademarks technology trading products data exchange registrations trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift our judgments and estimates may change which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not 

in performing the allocation of the acquisitions purchase price to assets and liabilities we consider among other factors the intended use of the acquired assets analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business at the acquisition date a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist we continue to review and assess our estimates assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by gaap which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition accordingly these estimates and assumptions are subject to change which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we have identified four reporting units our futures reporting unit our data and listings reporting unit our cash equities reporting unit and our fixed income and cds reporting unit 

our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinitelived intangibles to its estimated fair value 

goodwill impairment testing consists of a twostep methodology the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value including goodwill and other intangible assets of such reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no impairment loss is recognized and the second step which is a calculation of the impairment is not performed however if the carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value for annual goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill and other intangible assets if we conclude that this is the case we must perform the twostep methodology described above otherwise we can skip the twostep methodology and do not need to perform any further testing for annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing we also have 

the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount 

application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows longterm growth rates of our business operating margins discount rates weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets these estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment and changes to these estimates and assumptions as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor impairment 

the cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and when applicable various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of our business adverse market conditions adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations competition or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we are also required to evaluate other finitelived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable if impairment indicators are present then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these longlived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable if an asset is not recoverable the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us uk and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse 

sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 or sab 118 provided guidance for companies that had not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja in the period of enactment allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts as of december 31 2018 we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tcja we reaffirmed our position that we were not subject to transition tax under the tcja as of december 31 2017 in addition we concluded that the 764 million of deferred tax benefit recorded in the 2017 financial statements was a reasonable estimate of the tcja’s impact on our deferred tax and no further adjustments are necessary 

the fasb staff also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of global intangible lowtaxed income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred we have completed our analysis of the effects of these provisions and have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred 

we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position if the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 

we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we record accruals for the estimated 

outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter at any point in time many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities changes in facts and circumstances issuance of new regulations and resolution of tax audits 

we believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 




 

item 7 a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a result of our operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure manage monitor and report risk exposures which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm restricted cash shortterm and longterm investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2018  and 2017  our cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments were 20 billion and 16 billion respectively of which 275 million and 293 million respectively were denominated in pounds sterling euros or canadian dollars the remaining cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents are denominated in us dollars we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes a hypothetical decrease in longterm interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pretax earnings by 25 million as of december 31 2018  assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2018  we had 74 billion  in outstanding debt of which 65 billion  relates to our senior notes which bear interest at fixed interest rates the remaining amount outstanding of 951 million  relates to the commercial paper program which bears interest at fluctuating rates and therefore subjects us to interest rate risk a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in longterm interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31 2018  would decrease annual pretax earnings by 10 million  assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  debt” included in this annual report 

the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper program increased from 149 as of december 31 2017 to 248 as of december 31 2018 the increase in the commercial paper program weighted average interest rate was primarily due to the decisions by the us federal reserve in march 2018 june 2018 september 2018 and in december 2018 to increase the federal funds shortterm interest rate by an aggregate 100 basis points to 250 the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuance will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in shortterm interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as an international business we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling canadian dollars or euros and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros certain assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2018  and 2017  is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table dollars in millions except exchange rates 

  

 we have a significant part of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros in 2018  2017  and 2016  14 15 and 15 respectively of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros and 13 14 and 18 respectively of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes the us equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly 

foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables occur through our operations which are received in or paid in pounds sterling canadian dollars or euros due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of 2 million 4 million and 1 million in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the foreign currency transactions losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar a 10 adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2018  assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity would result in no additional foreign currency gain or loss 

we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2018  2017  and 2016  as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities 

we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using a current rate of exchange with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account a component of equity our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below in millions 



as of december 31 2018  and 2017  the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was 227 million  and 136 million  respectively in 2018  2017  and 2016  currency exchange rate differences had a positivenegative impact of  91 million  209 million  and  300 million  respectively on our 

consolidated equity the decrease in 2018  is primarily due to the decrease in the pound sterlingus dollar exchange rate to 12756 as of december 31 2018 from 13510 as of december 31 2017 due to the weakening of the pound sterling as compared to the us dollar the increase in 2017 is primarily due to the increase in the pound sterlingus dollar exchange rate to 13510 as of december 31 2017 from 12336 as of december 31 2016 due to the strengthening pound sterling as compared to the us dollar the future impact on our business relating to the uk leaving the eu and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time including future impacts on currency exchange rates 

credit risk 

we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests 

clearing house cash deposit risks 

the ice clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit market and liquidity risks refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ice clearing houses cash and cash equivalent deposits which were 640 billion  as of december 31 2018  while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits as the ice clearing houses may pass on interest revenues minus costs to the clearing members this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated 

 an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties our policies require diversification of counterparties banks financial institutions bond issuers and funds so as to avoid a concentration of risk 



control additionally the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount the typical haircut for high quality sovereign debt is 2 of the reverse repurchase amount which provides additional excess collateral thus in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the counterparty’s obligation 

the ice clearing houses may use thirdparty investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house such advisors do not hold clearing member cash or cash equivalent deposits or the underlying investments clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians including jpmorgan chase bank na citibank na bny mellon bmo harris na and euroclear bank brussels for nonus dollar deposits the ice clearing houses employ or may employ multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives 

 impact of inflation 

we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant in the event of inflation we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants as the prices that we charge are not governed by longterm contracts

clearing services we operate seven clearing houses each of which acts as a central counterparty that becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer for its clearing members through this central counterparty function the clearing houses provide financial security for each transaction for the duration of the position by limiting counterparty credit risk our clearing houses are responsible for providing clearing services to each of our futures exchanges and certain of our clearing houses clear contracts traded outside of our execution venues our clearing houses are 

 our clearing houses have never experienced an incident of a clearing member default which has required the use of the guaranty funds of nondefaulting clearing members or the assets of the clearing house we have extensive risk management procedures and governance in place to ensure we protect the interests of our clearing members and clearing houses each of our clearing houses has instituted a multilayered risk management system of rules policies and procedures to protect itself in the event of a clearing member default starting with membership criteria and continuing to powers of assessment other than for ngx in the event of a clearing member default generally as follows 

to ensure performance our clearing houses maintain extensive technology and quantitative risk management systems as well as financial and operational requirements for clearing members and minimum margin requirements for our cleared products our clearing houses use software based on industry standard margining conventions and on our proprietary models uniquely 

customized to our products to determine the appropriate margin requirements for each clearing member by simulating the possible gains and losses of complex portfolios based on price movements our clearing houses’ margin methodologies are independently validated on an annual basis 

in the event of a payment default by a member the default procedures specified in the rules of that clearing house would apply in general the clearing houses would first apply assets of the defaulting member to cover the obligation these include originalinitial margin variation margin positions held at the clearing house and other than for ngx guaranty fund deposits of the clearing member in addition the clearing houses could make a demand for payment pursuant to any available guaranty provided by the parent or affiliate of the defaulting clearing member if that is not sufficient the clearing houses would use any designated contributions held by the clearing house itself as applicable the guaranty fund contributions of other nondefaulting members and funds collected through an assessment against all other nondefaulting members to satisfy the remaining deficit if any as part of the powers and procedures designed to backstop financial obligations in the event of a default each of our clearing houses may levy assessments on all of its clearing members if there are insufficient funds available to cover a deficit following the depletion of all assets in the guaranty fund

competition 

the execution markets in which we operate are global and highly competitive we face competition in all aspects of our business from a number of different enterprises both domestic and international including traditional exchanges electronic trading platforms data vendors and voice brokers we believe we compete on the basis of a number of factors including

us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to develop new and innovative products and services enhance our technology infrastructure maintain liquidity and offer competitive costs 

in our derivatives markets certain exchanges replicate our futures contracts for example cme group lists our futures on agricultural and energy commodities currency and equity index contracts nasdaq futures inc or nfx an energy platform operated by nasdaq has also listed certain of our energy contracts we compete in european interest rates and equity derivatives with eurex which is the derivatives exchange operated by deutsche börse and curve global a consortium of banks and exchanges that lists interest rate futures in the european utilities markets we compete with the european energy exchange

nyse arca and nyse american options face considerable competition in the equity options markets their principal us competitors are the cboe and nasdaq 

our fixed income trading venues which include ice credit trade bondpoint and nyse bonds compete with other electronic trading venues such as those offered by bloomberg tradeweb and marketaxess our platforms also compete for volume traded bilaterally or trading activity that is not done through an electronic venue 

ice data services operates in a competitive environment for all of its constituent parts our exchange data products compete with similar offerings by other exchange groups that competition and the competition for order flow among the exchange groups creates a competitive pricing environment for our proprietary data products pricing and analytics competes with information obtained from informal industry relationships and sources such as broker quotes it along with the desktop and connectivity business competes with purchased thirdparty information and services from large global suppliers of financial market data such as bloomberg thomson reuters corporation and ihs markit one of the many offerings in our connectivity business sfti competes with other extranet providers such as centurylink and colt technology services our ice data indices business competes with a number of other index providers with significant index offerings including bloomberg ihs markit msci ftse russell and standard  poor’s

item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect us in the future if any of the risks discussed below actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected accordingly you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this annual report 

global economic political financial market and social events or conditions may negatively impact our business 

global economic conditions will impact our business adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment currency fluctuations actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending if our customers reduce spending workforce trading activity or demand for financial data as a result of challenges in the prevailing economic markets our revenues will decline further nyse’s revenue increases when more companies are willing to go public and stagnation or a decline in the ipo market could have an adverse effect on our revenues a prolonged decrease in the number of ipos could also negatively impact the growth of our transaction revenues since initial public offerings are typically actively traded following the offering date the number of public companies in the us has decreased significantly over the last twenty years 

a significant portion of our revenues are derived from fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets we derived 42 43 and 56 of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses from our transactionbased business in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively in particular we derive a significant percentage of the consolidated revenues from our transactionbased business from trading in ice brent crude futures and options contracts north american natural gas futures and options contracts sugar futures and options contracts equity transactions and shortterm interest rates contracts including the euribor and short sterling futures and options contracts the trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of trading activity for any reason including 

 a reduction in our overall trading volume could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenues a reduction in trading volumes could also result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for our market data which would further reduce our overall revenue 

in addition uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted or may result in decreased revenues or growth rates for example the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the uk’s exit from the eu could negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions that could continue for the foreseeable future such economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products and services 

our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to increased legislation and regulatory scrutiny and we face the risk of changes to this regulatory environment and business in the future 

we are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in many jurisdictions around the world and in particular in the us and the uk where the largest portions of our operations are conducted we face the risk of significant actions by regulatory and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments that may affect our business the activity of our market participants and as a consequence our results among other things as a result of regulators and tax authorities enforcing existing laws and regulations we could be censured fined prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities including fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory pricing restrictions also known as frand or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection 

with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees including settlement payments interest payments and penalty payments in many cases our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions 

there is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could be imposed this could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients’ overall trading volume through our exchanges and demand for our market data and other services in addition regulation imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally such as enhanced regulatory capital requirements could adversely impact levels of market activity and price volatility more broadly and thus impact our businesses the us government has indicated a goal of reforming many aspects of existing financial services regulations however it is unknown at this time to what extent new legislation will be passed into law or pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted or modified or the effect that such passage adoption or modification will have positively or negatively on our industry or on us 

these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our stockholders and creditors for example the adoption and implementation of position limit rules in the us and the eu could have an impact on our commodities business if comparable trading venues in foreign jurisdictions are not subject to equivalent rules position limits became effective in the eu beginning january 2018 and in certain cases the position limits are lower than us equivalent contracts and in other cases position limits are higher than us equivalent contracts these divergent regulations may cause us to move products from one jurisdiction to another as a result of business risks and competitive challenges and could significantly increase the regulatory compliance costs for our customers which could have a negative impact on our business 

us and eu legal and regulatory developments in response to the global financial crisis in particular the doddfrank act emir mifid ii and the benchmark regulation have significantly altered and propose to further alter the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability the enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes most likely to affect our businesses are position limit rules in the us and the eu nondiscriminatory access provisions of mifid ii interoperability and margin rules in emir enhanced regulatory capital liquidity and leverage rules in basel iii and capital requirements directive iv access rules under the benchmark regulation the nonharmonization of margin requirements implementation of a financial transaction tax access to our benchmarks and maintaining our exchanges’ abilities to operate as sros with related immunity for the discharge of their regulatory functions as the operator of global businesses the lack of harmonization in international financial reform efforts could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in multiple jurisdictions 

the doddfrank act established enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the fsoc ice clear credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the fsoc and as a result is subject to additional oversight by the cftc 

us income tax reform efforts could have a material impact on our business on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act or tcja was signed into law the tcja enacts broad changes to the existing us federal income tax code including reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 amongst many other complex provisions the ultimate impact of such tax reforms may differ from our current estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as the issuance of any further regulations or guidance that may alter the operation of the us federal income tax code various uncertainties also exist in terms of how us states and any foreign countries within which we operate will react to these us federal income tax reforms which could have additional impacts on our business 

the european commission has approved a data protection regulation known as the general data protection regulation or gdpr which has been finalized and comes into effect in may 2018 the gdpr will create a range of new compliance obligations for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the eu that are different than the compliance obligations currently in place in the eu and will include significant penalties for noncompliance 

other enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations 

systems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry could negatively impact us 

highprofile system failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry could negatively impact our business and result in regulatory investigations fines and penalties further regulators have imposed new requirements for trading platforms that have been costly for us to implement or that could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services in particular the sec’s regulation systems compliance and integrity or regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations subject portions of our securities and derivatives trading platforms and other technological systems related to our clearing houses trade repositories and the us swap execution facility or sef to more extensive regulation and oversight ensuring our compliance with the requirements of regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations requires significant implementation costs as well as increased ongoing administrative expenses and burdens if system failures in the industry continue to occur it is also possible that investor confidence in the trading industry could diminish leading to decreased trading volume and revenue whether or not any of our own systems experience material failures any of these developments could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

our business is subject to the impact of financial markets volatility including the prices and interest rates underlying our derivative products due to conditions that are beyond our control 

trading volume in our markets and products is largely driven by the degree of volatility  the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations  in prices and levels of the underlying commodities securities indices financial benchmarks or other instruments volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates opportunities for investment and speculative or arbitrage trading were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices or levels of the underlying commodities securities indices benchmarks or other instruments of our products we could experience lower trading volumes slower growth or declines in revenues 

factors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility and thus trading volumes include 

 any one or more of these factors which are beyond our control may reduce trading activity which could make our markets less attractive as a source of liquidity and in turn could further discourage existing and potential market participants and thus accelerate a decline in the level of trading activity and potentially related services such as data or clearing further lower market volatility could also result in more exchanges competing for trading volumes to maintain their growth if any of these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets could be jeopardized because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our current products and services decline for any reason we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues which would cause our net income to decline 

owning clearing houses exposes us to risks including risk related to defaults by clearing members risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses 

there are risks inherent in operating a clearing house including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members market liquidity risks defaults by clearing members and risks associated with custody and investing margin or guaranty fund assets provided by clearing members to our clearing houses which could subject our business to substantial losses for example clearing members have transferred an aggregate amount of cash in ice clear europe relating to margin and guaranty funds of 228 billion as of december 31 2017  and a total of 505 billion for all of our clearing houses as of december 31 2017  ice clear europe and ice clear us use third party investment managers for investment of cash assets and may add or change the investment managers from time to time to the extent available ice clear credit holds the us dollar cash and us treasuries that clearing members transfer to satisfy their original margin and guaranty fund requirements at its account at the 

federal reserve with respect to other clearing member cash posted ice clear credit currently selfmanages and uses external investment managers to invest such cash margin and guaranty fund deposits 

we have an obligation to return margin payments and guaranty fund contributions to clearing members to the extent that the relevant member’s risk based on its open contracts to the clearing house is reduced if a number of clearing members substantially reduce their open interest or default the concentration of risks within our clearing houses will be spread among a smaller pool of clearing members which would make it more difficult to absorb and manage risk in the event of a further clearing member’s default further following our acquisition of the bondpoint business in january 2018 creditex securities corporation intends to seek regulatory approval to be a clearing firm so that it can clear trades in fixed income securities executed on the creditex platforms selfclearing exposes our business to additional settlement and counterparty risk 

although our clearing houses have policies and procedures to help ensure that clearing members can satisfy their obligations such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a member or a counterparty’s default in addition although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards it is a complex process and there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect us from the risks of clearing these products we cannot assure you that these measures and safeguards will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default we have contributed our own capital to the guaranty fund of the clearing houses that could be used in the event of a default furthermore the default of any one of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and cause our customers to lose confidence in the guaranty of our clearing houses 

a decline in the value of securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions by our clearing houses or default by a sovereign government issuer could pose additional risks of default by clearing members 

our clearing houses hold a substantial amount of assets as margin or guaranty fund contributions which comprise us and other sovereign treasury securities as of december 31 2017  our clearing houses held 395 billion of noncash margin or guaranty fund contributions in us and other sovereign treasury securities 291 billion of this amount was comprised of us treasury securities 17 billion of french treasury securities 15 billion of german treasury securities 13 billion of italian treasury securities 12 billion of uk treasury securities and 46 billion of other european japanese and triparty treasury securities sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest and most liquid securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived credit worthiness of major governments although the markets for such securities have experienced significant volatility during the past decade and as of late due to ongoing financial challenges in some of the major european countries and the us government’s negotiations regarding taxation spending cuts and raising the debt ceiling which is the maximum amount of debt that the us government can legally incur in addition if there is a collapse of the euro our clearing houses would face significant expenses in changing their systems and such an event could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates to mitigate this risk our clearing houses currently apply a discount or “haircut” to the market values for all sovereign securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions however market conditions could change more quickly than we adjust the amount of the haircuts and the haircuts could be insufficient in the event of a sudden market event 

notwithstanding the current intraday margin and valuation checks conducted by our clearing houses and our policies and practices to limit exposures our clearing houses will need to continue to monitor the volatility and value of sovereign treasury securities if the value of these securities declines significantly our clearing houses will need to collect additional margin or guaranty fund contributions from their clearing members which may be difficult for the members to supply in a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government in addition our clearing houses may be required to impose a more significant discount on the value of sovereign treasury securities posted as margin or guaranty fund contributions if there is uncertainty regarding the future value of these securities which would trigger the need for additional margin or guaranty fund contributions by the clearing members if a clearing member cannot supply the additional margin or guaranty fund contributions which may include cash in a currency acceptable to the clearing house the clearing house would deem the clearing member in default if any clearing members default as a result of the reduction in the value of margin or guaranty fund contributions our clearing houses and trading business could suffer substantial losses as a result of the loss of any capital that has been contributed to the clearing house’s guaranty funds and a loss of confidence by clearing members in the clearing house resulting in a reduction in volumes of future cleared transactions 

further our clearing houses invest large sums through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and may hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions our clearing houses may also make time deposits with banks that are secured only to the value of fdic insurance or other national deposit guarantee schemes which is small and therefore the deposits may in significant part be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent 

owning and operating equity and options exchanges exposes us to additional risks including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject 

owning and operating equity and options exchanges for which the revenues are primarily derived from market data listing fees and trading activity exposes us to additional risks adverse economic conditions and regulatory changes similar to those discussed above including changes to the number of exchanges that are permitted to conduct closing auctions could result in decreased trading volume on our exchanges discourage market participants from listing on our equity and options exchanges or cause them to forgo new offerings any of these could reduce our revenues including market data revenue 

our exchanges are operated as forprofit businesses but have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled specifically our exchanges are responsible for enforcing listed company compliance with applicable listing standards overseeing regulatory policy determinations rule interpretation and regulationrelated rule development and conducting trading reviews any failure by one of our exchanges with selfregulatory responsibility to comply with and enforce compliance by their members with exchange rules and securities laws could significantly harm our reputation prompt regulatory scrutiny result in the payment of fines or penalties and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we must allocate significant resources to fulfill our selfregulatory responsibilities the forprofit exchanges’ goal of maximizing stockholder value might contradict the exchanges’ selfregulatory responsibilities the listing of our common stock on the nyse could potentially create a conflict between the exchange’s regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities on the one hand and our commercial and economic interest on the other hand while we have structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful 

further changes in the rules and operations of our securities markets must be reviewed and approved by the sec approval of such changes by the sec cannot be guaranteed and the sec could delay either the approval process or the initiation of the public comment process any denial or delay in approving changes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our compliance and risk management methods as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations might not be effective which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators 

our ability to comply with complex and changing laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel while we have policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks and regulatory obligations we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed regulators periodically review our exchanges’ ability to selfregulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including selfregulatory standards in particular certain of our businesses acquired in the nyse acquisition are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations policies and procedures if we fail to comply with any of these obligations regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business 

our acquisitions expose us to new regulatory requirements for example as a result of our acquisitions of interactive data and securities evaluations we operate two sec registered investment advisers investment advisers are subject to significant regulatory obligations under the investment advisers act prior to these acquisitions none of our businesses were registered under the investment advisers act compliance with the investment advisers act and other regulatory requirements gives rise to costs and expenses that may be material in addition our acquisition of the bondpoint ats in january 2018 exposes us to increased exposure to regulatory scrutiny from the sec and finra   

our regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses for example we paid a 5 million penalty to the sec in 2014 and a 3 million penalty to the cftc in 2015 as a result of enforcement actions brought by these regulators in december 2015 nyse received an inquiry from the enforcement staff of the sec regarding a july 8 2015 outage on the nyse markets during which trading was suspended for approximately 35 hours in all symbols the investigation proceeded throughout 2016 and on december 29 2016 nyse received a wells notice stating that the staff made a preliminary determination to recommend that the sec file an enforcement action in connection with how nyse responded to the circumstances leading up to the suspension of trading for this matter and other sec investigations we have recorded an aggregate of 14 million in expense accruals as of december 31 2017 the specific results of the wells notice and these enforcement actions are unknown at this time 

we will continue to face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our financial condition operating results or 

ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business further any settlement consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or regulatory agencies begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities finally the implementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to remain competitive and grow our business 

we face intense competition 

we face intense competition in all aspects of our business and our competitors both domestic and international are numerous we currently compete with 

 trends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings finally many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and ats businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business 

we also face pricing competition in many areas of our business a decline in our fees due to competitive pressure the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for example interactive data’s business has benefited from a high renewal rate in its subscription based business but we cannot assure you that this will continue we also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers if we are not able to compete successfully our business could be materially impacted including our ability to remain as an operating entity 

in our listings business the legal and regulatory environment in the us and the market perceptions about that environment may make it difficult for our us equity exchanges to compete with nonus equity exchanges for listings for example negative perceptions regarding compliance costs associated with adherence to corporate governance requirements and risks of litigation have and may continue to discourage listings on us equity exchanges by both us and foreign private issuers any failure by our exchanges to successfully compete for any reason could adversely impact our revenue derived from listing fees and the associated trading execution and market data fees 

we may have difficulty maintaining our growth effectively 

we have achieved a tremendous amount of growth since becoming a public company in 2005 our growth is highly dependent on customer demand for our core products and services favorable economic conditions and our ability to invest in our personnel facilities infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls adverse economic conditions could reduce customer demand for our products and services which may place a significant strain on our management and resources and could force us to defer existing or future planned opportunities in addition we may not be successful in executing on our strategies to support our growth organically or through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances 

our systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks hacking and cyberattacks especially in light of our role in the global financial marketplace which could result in wrongful use of our information or that of a third party or which could make our participants reluctant to use our electronic platform 

the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to reliably transact on our electronic platforms and provide financial data services are critical elements of our operations some of our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential client data including client portfolio information if anyone gains improper access to our electronic platforms networks or databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify our confidential information or that of a third party breaches of our cybersecurity measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business our networks and those of our participants third party service providers and external market infrastructures may be vulnerable to compromise security technology failure social engineering denial of service attacks or other security failures resulting in loss of data integrity information disclosure unavailability or fraud the financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of political protest activism and fraud further former employees of certain companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly 

although we have not been the victim of cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity events including distributed denial of service attacks malware infections phishing web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size for example we experienced a distributed denial of service attack against our website in november 2016 that activated automated mitigation response and was reportable to regulatory authorities while we operate an information security program that is designed to prevent detect track and mitigate cyber incidents and that has detected and mitigated such incidents in the past we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against attacks losses or reduced trading volume in our markets as a result of any security breach hacking or cyberattack any such attacks could result in reputational damage cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose customers cause us to experience lower current and future trading volumes or incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive position in addition given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or disable or degrade systems such intrusions may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely additionally as threats continue to evolve and increase and as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous including as a result of the european commission’s approval of gdpr we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities which could adversely impact our net income 

we may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities 

we intend to launch new products and continue to explore and pursue other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may spend substantial time and money developing new product offerings or improving current product offerings if these offerings are not successful we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to recover the costs of such initiatives obtaining any required regulatory approval associated with these offerings may also result in delays or restrictions on our ability to fully benefit from these offerings further we may enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry attracting customers in certain countries may also be subject to a number of risks including currency exchange rate risk difficulties in enforcing agreements or collecting receivables longer payment cycles compliance with the laws or regulations of these countries and political and regulatory uncertainties 

in addition in light of consolidation in the exchange data services and clearing sectors and competition for opportunities we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully our competitors could merge making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors also offering new products and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives that are necessary for our success 

we have made substantial progress toward developing and deploying new technology platforms to improve our equity exchange business and data services business we may experience disruptions or encounter unexpected challenges in deploying these new systems further the costs to complete the remaining work may exceed our current expectations any significant cost 

increases or disruptions to product quality sales effectiveness or client service or to our other business operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences we may not be able to compete effectively 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary and acquired technology the financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change change in use patterns change in client preferences frequent product and service introductions and the emergence of new industry standards and practices these changes could render our existing proprietary technology uncompetitive or obsolete we are in the process of implementing a new trading technology system at nyse and if there are trading disruptions or if the new system has inadequate performance we could suffer material losses incur reputational damage or be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny 

further we use some opensource software in our technology most often as small components within a larger product or service to augment algorithms functionalities or libraries we create and we may use more opensource software in the future opensource code is also contained in some thirdparty software we rely on we could be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of the license for such opensource software the terms of many opensource licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us or other courts and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology to our clients’ requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and costeffective manner any failure to remain abreast of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to client preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our revenues 

our business may be harmed by computer and communications systems failures and delays 

our business depends on the integrity reliability and security of our computer and communication systems we support and maintain many of the systems that comprise our electronic platforms and our failure to monitor or maintain these systems or to find replacements for defective components within a system in a timely and costeffective manner when necessary could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business our customers rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate and highquality financial market data analytics and related solutions our timely reliable delivery of highquality products and services is subject to an array of technical production processes that enable our delivery platforms to leverage an extensive range of content databases our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

 we could experience system failures due to power or telecommunications failures human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyberattacks intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar events if any one or more of these situations were to arise they could result in damage to our business reputation and participant dissatisfaction with our electronic platform which could prompt participants to trade elsewhere or expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions as a consequence our business financial condition and operating results could suffer materially 

our regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time however we cannot 

assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in volume of order and trading transaction traffic and to provide processing and clearing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

we currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness 

as of december 31 2017 we had 61 billion of outstanding debt this level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities as we use our available resources to reduce and refinance our consolidated debt our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue future business opportunities may be further restrained in addition the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio test and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other matters further a significant portion of our outstanding debt has been in commercial paper which is subject to interest rate changes rising interest rates will result in an increase in our interest expense 

our longterm debt is currently rated by moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s these ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time and it is possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade our credit ratings in the future in particular our inability to sustain reduced debt on a consolidated basis may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings a significant downgrade of our credit ratings could impact customers’ willingness to use our clearing houses make parties less willing to do business with us and could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase the cost of any future debt funding we may obtain 

failure to evolve our benchmarks and indices in a manner that maintains the relevance of the benchmark or index damage to our reputation resulting from our administration of libor or other benchmarks and indices and the potential replacement of libor could adversely affect our business 

we operate multiple global benchmark products and indices across our asset classes and a significant portion of our volume is based on these products to ensure continued trading in our benchmark products and indices we must be able to demonstrate that our products are not readily subject to manipulation and we must continue to evolve our products to maintain their relevance our subsidiary iba is the administrator for various benchmarks including libor iba’s administration of libor is the result of the libor scandal which was a series of fraudulent actions taken by banks that were submitting false libor rates to profit from trades or to give the impression that the banks were more creditworthy than they were any failures or negative publicity resulting from our administration of libor or other benchmarks could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and could harm our business and our reputation 

in july 2017 the fca announced the desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 at this time it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes any establishment of alternative references rates or any other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the uk or elsewhere the elimination of libor or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may fail to complete or realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our recent acquisitions and future acquisitions which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we have completed many acquisitions and plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to integrate these businesses into our existing operations and realize anticipated cost savings revenue synergies and growth opportunities we generally set aggressive timelines for realizing savings   which assumes we successfully undertake a variety of actions including but not limited to integrating technology eliminating redundancies and effecting organizational restructurings that are themselves subject to a variety of risks and may be subject to regulatory approvals 

that we do not control the process of integrating acquired companies is time consuming and could disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties including inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants regulators and others require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of the business 

there is a risk however that we may not integrate these acquired companies in a manner that permits our expected cost savings and revenue synergies to be fully realized in the time periods expected or at all in addition a variety of factors including but not limited to regulatory conditions governmental competition approvals currency fluctuations and difficulty integrating technology platforms may adversely affect our ability to complete our acquisitions or realize our anticipated cost savings and synergies for example the uk competition and markets authority or cma ordered a divestment of trayport and such divestment was completed in december 2017 

we may also not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures or alliances that we have entered into or may enter into for a number of reasons including regulatory or government approvals or changes global market changes contractual obligations competing products and in some instances our lack of or limited control over the management of the business further strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future 

as a result of any future acquisition we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest expend cash incur debt assume actual and contingent liabilities inherit existing or pending litigation or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets further we cannot assure you that any such financing or equity investments will be available with terms that will be favorable to us or available at all 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

since we conduct operations in several different countries including the us uk eu and canada substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling euros and canadian dollars because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

external events such as brexit the negotiations regarding the terms of the uk’s exit from the eu the outcome of the us presidential election and the passage of us taxation reform legislation each have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially among the us dollar the british pound sterling and the euro if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the uk eu the us or other key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further the value of the pound sterling and euro and the global credit markets may further weaken general financial instability in countries in the eu could have a contagion effect on the region and contribute to the general instability and uncertainty in the eu events that adversely affect our uk and eu clients and suppliers could in turn have a materially adverse effect on our international business results and our operating results 

for additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk refer to “ foreign currency exchange rate risk” in item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk which is included in this annual report” 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill other intangible assets or investments 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2017  we had goodwill of  122 billion  and net other intangible assets of  103 billion  relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties we recorded a 33 million impairment loss on our creditex customer relationship intangible assets during 2016 primarily due to the sale of our creditex us voice broker operations and the discontinuance of our creditex uk voice brokerage operations in 2016 

as of december 31 2016  we had 432 million in longterm investments relating to our equity security investment in cetip sa or cetip in 2017 we sold our equity security investment in cetip and recognized a realized net investment gain of 167 million 

on october 24 2017 we acquired a 47  stake in euroclear for €275 million  in cash  327 million  based on the eurous dollar exchange rate of 11903 as of october 24 2017 during december 2017 we reached an agreement to buy an additional 51  stake in euroclear for €243 million  in cash  292 million  based on the eurous dollar exchange rate of 12003 as of december 31 2017 and expect to receive necessary regulatory approval during the first quarter of 2018 upon closing we will own a 98 stake in euroclear for a total investment of €518 million 619 million based on the exchange rates above euroclear is a leading provider of posttrade services including settlement central securities depositories and related services for crossborder transactions across asset classes 

the financial accounting standards board or fasb has issued accounting standards update or asu no 201601 which provides updated guidance for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of certain financial assets and liabilities including the requirement that equity investments except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee are to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income we were required to adopt asu 201601 on january 1 2018 our cost method investments including our investment in euroclear and our 18 stake in coinbase global inc among others will be impacted by our adoption of asu 201601 beginning in the first quarter of 2018 these companies do not currently have readily determinable fair market values as they are not publicly listed companies therefore in accordance with asu 201601 we will only adjust the fair value of these investments if and when there is an observable price change in an orderly transaction and any change in the fair value will be recognized in net income 

we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may result in asset impairments an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill other intangible assets and other investments and assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 

for additional information on our goodwill other intangible assets and investments including the impairment and realized investment gain refer to notes 3 6 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements and “ critical accounting policies  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets” in item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which are included in this annual report 

we may face liability for content contained in our data products and services 

we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation libel copyright or trademark infringement fraud or negligence or based on other theories of liability in each case relating to the data articles commentary ratings information or other content we distribute in our financial data services if such data or other content or information that we distribute has errors is delayed or has design defects we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our corporate website or those websites that we own and operate through links to other websites use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for significant amounts any such claim even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us could involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and a negative impact on our reputation 

in addition we license and redistribute data and content from various third parties and the terms of these licenses change frequently our third party data and content suppliers may audit our use of and our clients’ use of and payment for data and content from time to time in the ordinary course of business including audits currently underway such third party data and content suppliers may assert that we or our clients owe additional amounts under the terms of the applicable license agreements that we inappropriately distributed the third party data or that we or our clients used the data or content in a manner that exceeded the scope of the applicable license agreement we have and expect to continue to spend and allocate resources to develop and acquire the use of technology and other intellectual property rights to manage these risks and track third party data usage but we cannot be assured that we will not incur liability we may incur costs to investigate any allegations and may be required to pay damages to or make unexpected settlement payments to these data and content suppliers and these costs and payments could be material 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties including trademarks service marks trade names trade secrets copyrights and patents we cannot assure you that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property additionally we may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could harm our reputation and 

affect our ability to compete effectively further we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights which may require significant financial and managerial resources as a result we may choose not to enforce our infringed intellectual property rights depending on our strategic evaluation and judgment regarding the best use of our resources the relative strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the recourse available to us 

in addition our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may have obtained and may be expected to obtain in the future patent rights related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services as a result we may face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the holders of the patents or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patents we also could be required to pay damages if we were found to infringe patents held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we rely on third party providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of an important service data or content supplied by any third party or the loss of an exclusive license could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as online service providers hosting service and software providers data processors software and hardware vendors banks local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading clearing data services and other systems we rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with third parties and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for the provision of hosting services we also depend on thirdparty suppliers for data and content including data received from certain competitors clients various government and public record services and financial institutions used in our products and services some of this data is exclusive to particular suppliers and may not be obtained from other suppliers in addition our data suppliers could enter into exclusive contracts with our competitors without our knowledge the general trend toward industry consolidation may increase the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future if these companies were to discontinue providing services to us for any reason or fail to provide the type of service agreed to we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients or increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines our third party data suppliers perform audits on us from time to time in the ordinary course of business to determine if data we license for redistribution has been properly accounted for in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreement as a result of these audits we may incur additional expenses 

many of our clients also rely on third parties to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform if these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients’ inability to transact with our businesses we hold exclusive licenses to list various index futures and contracts in the future litigation or regulatory action may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and contracts trading to a single exchange and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license mifid ii introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of services relating to commodity derivatives across europe and the legislation requires open access to any benchmarks a benchmark is an index or other measure used to determine the value of a financial instrument for example libor or the sp 500 used in europe if unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive license were permitted we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products 

we are subject to significant litigation and liability risks 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our participants involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred for example dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platform or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades abusive trading practices security and confidentiality breaches mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants in addition because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by 

entering them inaccurately a large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets 

in addition we are subject to ongoing legal disputes that could result in the payment of fines penalties or damages and could expose us to additional liability in the future for example on december 19 2017 the us court of appeals for the second circuit or the second circuit issued its decision in city of providence v bats global markets et al two of our subsidiaries new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca inc are defendants in this case in vacating the district court’s dismissal of this lawsuit and remanding for further proceedings the second circuit concluded in part that the defendant securities exchanges are not immune from the claims in this case because absolute immunity is available to a selfregulatory organization like the new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca inc only when they carry out regulatory functions although our exchanges will continue to have other defenses available to them in securities litigation cases including in this matter limitations on the doctrine of absolute immunity could result in an increased exposure to litigation and to increased liability andor other legal expenses 

further we could incur significant expenses defending claims even those without merit which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us including those we are involved with due to acquisition activity may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we may have to establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for a summary of our legal proceedings and claims 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

given our prominence in the global securities industry and the location of many of our properties and personnel in us and european financial centers including lower manhattan we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees in addition terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets including trading on exchanges any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

damage to our reputation could damage our business 

our business is highly competitive and our customers typically have options on where to conduct their business our management team and business operations benefit from being highly regarded in our industry maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and for maintaining our relationships with our regulators negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services operations risk management compliance with regulations or management team could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our existing business and business prospects 

owning and operating voice broker and electronic fixed income brokerage businesses exposes us to additional risk and these businesses are largely dependent on general market conditions 

our voice broker business provides brokerage services to clients in the form of agency transactions in commodity products in agency transactions customers pay transaction fees for trade execution services in which we connect buyers and sellers who settle their transactions directly in connection with our fixed income business our brokerdealers operate in both an agency and in a matched principal capacity also known as “riskless principal” when trading as matched principal we agree to buy instruments from one customer and sell them to another customer the amount of the fee generally depends on the spread between the buy and sell price of the security that is brokered with respect to matched principal transactions a counterparty to a matched principal transaction may fail to fulfill its obligations or we may face liability for an unmatched trade we also face the risk of not being able to collect transaction or processing fees charged to customers for brokerage services and processing services we provide 

we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt is dividends from our subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ice 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for ice these provisions make a change of control less likely which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of us and european equity exchanges for example our organizational documents include provisions that generally restrict any person either alone or together with its related persons from i voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10 of our outstanding voting capital stock including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock or ii beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock further our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to call special stockholders’ meetings or act by written consent and generally authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock in addition provisions of delaware law may have a similar effect such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders as defined under delaware law from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the board of directors

item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect us in the future if any of the risks discussed below actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected accordingly you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this annual report 

global economic political financial market and social events or conditions may negatively impact our business 

global economic conditions will impact our business adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment currency fluctuations actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending if our customers reduce spending workforce trading activity or demand for financial data as a result of challenges in the prevailing economic markets our revenues will decline further nyse’s revenue increases when more companies are willing to go public and stagnation or a decline in the ipo market could have an adverse effect on our revenues a prolonged decrease in the number of ipos could also negatively impact the growth of our transaction revenues since initial public offerings are typically actively traded following the offering date the number of public companies in the us has decreased significantly over the last twenty years 

a significant portion of our revenues are derived from fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets we derived 42 43 and 56 of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses from our transactionbased business in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively in particular we derive a significant percentage of the consolidated revenues from our transactionbased business from trading in ice brent crude futures and options contracts north american natural gas futures and options contracts sugar futures and options contracts equity transactions and shortterm interest rates contracts including the euribor and short sterling futures and options contracts the trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of trading activity for any reason including 

 a reduction in our overall trading volume could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenues a reduction in trading volumes could also result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for our market data which would further reduce our overall revenue 

in addition uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted or may result in decreased revenues or growth rates for example the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the uk’s exit from the eu could negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions that could continue for the foreseeable future such economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products and services 

our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to increased legislation and regulatory scrutiny and we face the risk of changes to this regulatory environment and business in the future 

we are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in many jurisdictions around the world and in particular in the us and the uk where the largest portions of our operations are conducted we face the risk of significant actions by regulatory and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments that may affect our business the activity of our market participants and as a consequence our results among other things as a result of regulators and tax authorities enforcing existing laws and regulations we could be censured fined prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities including fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory pricing restrictions also known as frand or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection 

with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees including settlement payments interest payments and penalty payments in many cases our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions 

there is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could be imposed this could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients’ overall trading volume through our exchanges and demand for our market data and other services in addition regulation imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally such as enhanced regulatory capital requirements could adversely impact levels of market activity and price volatility more broadly and thus impact our businesses the us government has indicated a goal of reforming many aspects of existing financial services regulations however it is unknown at this time to what extent new legislation will be passed into law or pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted or modified or the effect that such passage adoption or modification will have positively or negatively on our industry or on us 

these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our stockholders and creditors for example the adoption and implementation of position limit rules in the us and the eu could have an impact on our commodities business if comparable trading venues in foreign jurisdictions are not subject to equivalent rules position limits became effective in the eu beginning january 2018 and in certain cases the position limits are lower than us equivalent contracts and in other cases position limits are higher than us equivalent contracts these divergent regulations may cause us to move products from one jurisdiction to another as a result of business risks and competitive challenges and could significantly increase the regulatory compliance costs for our customers which could have a negative impact on our business 

us and eu legal and regulatory developments in response to the global financial crisis in particular the doddfrank act emir mifid ii and the benchmark regulation have significantly altered and propose to further alter the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability the enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes most likely to affect our businesses are position limit rules in the us and the eu nondiscriminatory access provisions of mifid ii interoperability and margin rules in emir enhanced regulatory capital liquidity and leverage rules in basel iii and capital requirements directive iv access rules under the benchmark regulation the nonharmonization of margin requirements implementation of a financial transaction tax access to our benchmarks and maintaining our exchanges’ abilities to operate as sros with related immunity for the discharge of their regulatory functions as the operator of global businesses the lack of harmonization in international financial reform efforts could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in multiple jurisdictions 

the doddfrank act established enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the fsoc ice clear credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the fsoc and as a result is subject to additional oversight by the cftc 

us income tax reform efforts could have a material impact on our business on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act or tcja was signed into law the tcja enacts broad changes to the existing us federal income tax code including reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 amongst many other complex provisions the ultimate impact of such tax reforms may differ from our current estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as the issuance of any further regulations or guidance that may alter the operation of the us federal income tax code various uncertainties also exist in terms of how us states and any foreign countries within which we operate will react to these us federal income tax reforms which could have additional impacts on our business 

the european commission has approved a data protection regulation known as the general data protection regulation or gdpr which has been finalized and comes into effect in may 2018 the gdpr will create a range of new compliance obligations for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the eu that are different than the compliance obligations currently in place in the eu and will include significant penalties for noncompliance 

other enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations 

systems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry could negatively impact us 

highprofile system failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry could negatively impact our business and result in regulatory investigations fines and penalties further regulators have imposed new requirements for trading platforms that have been costly for us to implement or that could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services in particular the sec’s regulation systems compliance and integrity or regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations subject portions of our securities and derivatives trading platforms and other technological systems related to our clearing houses trade repositories and the us swap execution facility or sef to more extensive regulation and oversight ensuring our compliance with the requirements of regulation sci and the cftc’s system safeguards regulations requires significant implementation costs as well as increased ongoing administrative expenses and burdens if system failures in the industry continue to occur it is also possible that investor confidence in the trading industry could diminish leading to decreased trading volume and revenue whether or not any of our own systems experience material failures any of these developments could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

our business is subject to the impact of financial markets volatility including the prices and interest rates underlying our derivative products due to conditions that are beyond our control 

trading volume in our markets and products is largely driven by the degree of volatility  the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations  in prices and levels of the underlying commodities securities indices financial benchmarks or other instruments volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates opportunities for investment and speculative or arbitrage trading were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices or levels of the underlying commodities securities indices benchmarks or other instruments of our products we could experience lower trading volumes slower growth or declines in revenues 

factors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility and thus trading volumes include 

 any one or more of these factors which are beyond our control may reduce trading activity which could make our markets less attractive as a source of liquidity and in turn could further discourage existing and potential market participants and thus accelerate a decline in the level of trading activity and potentially related services such as data or clearing further lower market volatility could also result in more exchanges competing for trading volumes to maintain their growth if any of these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets could be jeopardized because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our current products and services decline for any reason we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues which would cause our net income to decline 

owning clearing houses exposes us to risks including risk related to defaults by clearing members risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses 

there are risks inherent in operating a clearing house including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members market liquidity risks defaults by clearing members and risks associated with custody and investing margin or guaranty fund assets provided by clearing members to our clearing houses which could subject our business to substantial losses for example clearing members have transferred an aggregate amount of cash in ice clear europe relating to margin and guaranty funds of 228 billion as of december 31 2017  and a total of 505 billion for all of our clearing houses as of december 31 2017  ice clear europe and ice clear us use third party investment managers for investment of cash assets and may add or change the investment managers from time to time to the extent available ice clear credit holds the us dollar cash and us treasuries that clearing members transfer to satisfy their original margin and guaranty fund requirements at its account at the 

federal reserve with respect to other clearing member cash posted ice clear credit currently selfmanages and uses external investment managers to invest such cash margin and guaranty fund deposits 

we have an obligation to return margin payments and guaranty fund contributions to clearing members to the extent that the relevant member’s risk based on its open contracts to the clearing house is reduced if a number of clearing members substantially reduce their open interest or default the concentration of risks within our clearing houses will be spread among a smaller pool of clearing members which would make it more difficult to absorb and manage risk in the event of a further clearing member’s default further following our acquisition of the bondpoint business in january 2018 creditex securities corporation intends to seek regulatory approval to be a clearing firm so that it can clear trades in fixed income securities executed on the creditex platforms selfclearing exposes our business to additional settlement and counterparty risk 

although our clearing houses have policies and procedures to help ensure that clearing members can satisfy their obligations such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a member or a counterparty’s default in addition although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards it is a complex process and there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect us from the risks of clearing these products we cannot assure you that these measures and safeguards will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default we have contributed our own capital to the guaranty fund of the clearing houses that could be used in the event of a default furthermore the default of any one of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and cause our customers to lose confidence in the guaranty of our clearing houses 

a decline in the value of securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions by our clearing houses or default by a sovereign government issuer could pose additional risks of default by clearing members 

our clearing houses hold a substantial amount of assets as margin or guaranty fund contributions which comprise us and other sovereign treasury securities as of december 31 2017  our clearing houses held 395 billion of noncash margin or guaranty fund contributions in us and other sovereign treasury securities 291 billion of this amount was comprised of us treasury securities 17 billion of french treasury securities 15 billion of german treasury securities 13 billion of italian treasury securities 12 billion of uk treasury securities and 46 billion of other european japanese and triparty treasury securities sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest and most liquid securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived credit worthiness of major governments although the markets for such securities have experienced significant volatility during the past decade and as of late due to ongoing financial challenges in some of the major european countries and the us government’s negotiations regarding taxation spending cuts and raising the debt ceiling which is the maximum amount of debt that the us government can legally incur in addition if there is a collapse of the euro our clearing houses would face significant expenses in changing their systems and such an event could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates to mitigate this risk our clearing houses currently apply a discount or “haircut” to the market values for all sovereign securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions however market conditions could change more quickly than we adjust the amount of the haircuts and the haircuts could be insufficient in the event of a sudden market event 

notwithstanding the current intraday margin and valuation checks conducted by our clearing houses and our policies and practices to limit exposures our clearing houses will need to continue to monitor the volatility and value of sovereign treasury securities if the value of these securities declines significantly our clearing houses will need to collect additional margin or guaranty fund contributions from their clearing members which may be difficult for the members to supply in a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government in addition our clearing houses may be required to impose a more significant discount on the value of sovereign treasury securities posted as margin or guaranty fund contributions if there is uncertainty regarding the future value of these securities which would trigger the need for additional margin or guaranty fund contributions by the clearing members if a clearing member cannot supply the additional margin or guaranty fund contributions which may include cash in a currency acceptable to the clearing house the clearing house would deem the clearing member in default if any clearing members default as a result of the reduction in the value of margin or guaranty fund contributions our clearing houses and trading business could suffer substantial losses as a result of the loss of any capital that has been contributed to the clearing house’s guaranty funds and a loss of confidence by clearing members in the clearing house resulting in a reduction in volumes of future cleared transactions 

further our clearing houses invest large sums through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and may hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions our clearing houses may also make time deposits with banks that are secured only to the value of fdic insurance or other national deposit guarantee schemes which is small and therefore the deposits may in significant part be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent 

owning and operating equity and options exchanges exposes us to additional risks including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject 

owning and operating equity and options exchanges for which the revenues are primarily derived from market data listing fees and trading activity exposes us to additional risks adverse economic conditions and regulatory changes similar to those discussed above including changes to the number of exchanges that are permitted to conduct closing auctions could result in decreased trading volume on our exchanges discourage market participants from listing on our equity and options exchanges or cause them to forgo new offerings any of these could reduce our revenues including market data revenue 

our exchanges are operated as forprofit businesses but have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled specifically our exchanges are responsible for enforcing listed company compliance with applicable listing standards overseeing regulatory policy determinations rule interpretation and regulationrelated rule development and conducting trading reviews any failure by one of our exchanges with selfregulatory responsibility to comply with and enforce compliance by their members with exchange rules and securities laws could significantly harm our reputation prompt regulatory scrutiny result in the payment of fines or penalties and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we must allocate significant resources to fulfill our selfregulatory responsibilities the forprofit exchanges’ goal of maximizing stockholder value might contradict the exchanges’ selfregulatory responsibilities the listing of our common stock on the nyse could potentially create a conflict between the exchange’s regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities on the one hand and our commercial and economic interest on the other hand while we have structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful 

further changes in the rules and operations of our securities markets must be reviewed and approved by the sec approval of such changes by the sec cannot be guaranteed and the sec could delay either the approval process or the initiation of the public comment process any denial or delay in approving changes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our compliance and risk management methods as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations might not be effective which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators 

our ability to comply with complex and changing laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel while we have policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks and regulatory obligations we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed regulators periodically review our exchanges’ ability to selfregulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including selfregulatory standards in particular certain of our businesses acquired in the nyse acquisition are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations policies and procedures if we fail to comply with any of these obligations regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business 

our acquisitions expose us to new regulatory requirements for example as a result of our acquisitions of interactive data and securities evaluations we operate two sec registered investment advisers investment advisers are subject to significant regulatory obligations under the investment advisers act prior to these acquisitions none of our businesses were registered under the investment advisers act compliance with the investment advisers act and other regulatory requirements gives rise to costs and expenses that may be material in addition our acquisition of the bondpoint ats in january 2018 exposes us to increased exposure to regulatory scrutiny from the sec and finra   

our regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses for example we paid a 5 million penalty to the sec in 2014 and a 3 million penalty to the cftc in 2015 as a result of enforcement actions brought by these regulators in december 2015 nyse received an inquiry from the enforcement staff of the sec regarding a july 8 2015 outage on the nyse markets during which trading was suspended for approximately 35 hours in all symbols the investigation proceeded throughout 2016 and on december 29 2016 nyse received a wells notice stating that the staff made a preliminary determination to recommend that the sec file an enforcement action in connection with how nyse responded to the circumstances leading up to the suspension of trading for this matter and other sec investigations we have recorded an aggregate of 14 million in expense accruals as of december 31 2017 the specific results of the wells notice and these enforcement actions are unknown at this time 

we will continue to face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our financial condition operating results or 

ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business further any settlement consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or regulatory agencies begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities finally the implementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to remain competitive and grow our business 

we face intense competition 

we face intense competition in all aspects of our business and our competitors both domestic and international are numerous we currently compete with 

 trends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings finally many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and ats businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business 

we also face pricing competition in many areas of our business a decline in our fees due to competitive pressure the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for example interactive data’s business has benefited from a high renewal rate in its subscription based business but we cannot assure you that this will continue we also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers if we are not able to compete successfully our business could be materially impacted including our ability to remain as an operating entity 

in our listings business the legal and regulatory environment in the us and the market perceptions about that environment may make it difficult for our us equity exchanges to compete with nonus equity exchanges for listings for example negative perceptions regarding compliance costs associated with adherence to corporate governance requirements and risks of litigation have and may continue to discourage listings on us equity exchanges by both us and foreign private issuers any failure by our exchanges to successfully compete for any reason could adversely impact our revenue derived from listing fees and the associated trading execution and market data fees 

we may have difficulty maintaining our growth effectively 

we have achieved a tremendous amount of growth since becoming a public company in 2005 our growth is highly dependent on customer demand for our core products and services favorable economic conditions and our ability to invest in our personnel facilities infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls adverse economic conditions could reduce customer demand for our products and services which may place a significant strain on our management and resources and could force us to defer existing or future planned opportunities in addition we may not be successful in executing on our strategies to support our growth organically or through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances 

our systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks hacking and cyberattacks especially in light of our role in the global financial marketplace which could result in wrongful use of our information or that of a third party or which could make our participants reluctant to use our electronic platform 

the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to reliably transact on our electronic platforms and provide financial data services are critical elements of our operations some of our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential client data including client portfolio information if anyone gains improper access to our electronic platforms networks or databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify our confidential information or that of a third party breaches of our cybersecurity measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business our networks and those of our participants third party service providers and external market infrastructures may be vulnerable to compromise security technology failure social engineering denial of service attacks or other security failures resulting in loss of data integrity information disclosure unavailability or fraud the financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of political protest activism and fraud further former employees of certain companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly 

although we have not been the victim of cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity events including distributed denial of service attacks malware infections phishing web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size for example we experienced a distributed denial of service attack against our website in november 2016 that activated automated mitigation response and was reportable to regulatory authorities while we operate an information security program that is designed to prevent detect track and mitigate cyber incidents and that has detected and mitigated such incidents in the past we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against attacks losses or reduced trading volume in our markets as a result of any security breach hacking or cyberattack any such attacks could result in reputational damage cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose customers cause us to experience lower current and future trading volumes or incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive position in addition given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or disable or degrade systems such intrusions may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely additionally as threats continue to evolve and increase and as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous including as a result of the european commission’s approval of gdpr we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities which could adversely impact our net income 

we may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities 

we intend to launch new products and continue to explore and pursue other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may spend substantial time and money developing new product offerings or improving current product offerings if these offerings are not successful we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to recover the costs of such initiatives obtaining any required regulatory approval associated with these offerings may also result in delays or restrictions on our ability to fully benefit from these offerings further we may enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry attracting customers in certain countries may also be subject to a number of risks including currency exchange rate risk difficulties in enforcing agreements or collecting receivables longer payment cycles compliance with the laws or regulations of these countries and political and regulatory uncertainties 

in addition in light of consolidation in the exchange data services and clearing sectors and competition for opportunities we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully our competitors could merge making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors also offering new products and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives that are necessary for our success 

we have made substantial progress toward developing and deploying new technology platforms to improve our equity exchange business and data services business we may experience disruptions or encounter unexpected challenges in deploying these new systems further the costs to complete the remaining work may exceed our current expectations any significant cost 

increases or disruptions to product quality sales effectiveness or client service or to our other business operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences we may not be able to compete effectively 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary and acquired technology the financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change change in use patterns change in client preferences frequent product and service introductions and the emergence of new industry standards and practices these changes could render our existing proprietary technology uncompetitive or obsolete we are in the process of implementing a new trading technology system at nyse and if there are trading disruptions or if the new system has inadequate performance we could suffer material losses incur reputational damage or be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny 

further we use some opensource software in our technology most often as small components within a larger product or service to augment algorithms functionalities or libraries we create and we may use more opensource software in the future opensource code is also contained in some thirdparty software we rely on we could be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of the license for such opensource software the terms of many opensource licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us or other courts and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology to our clients’ requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and costeffective manner any failure to remain abreast of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to client preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our revenues 

our business may be harmed by computer and communications systems failures and delays 

our business depends on the integrity reliability and security of our computer and communication systems we support and maintain many of the systems that comprise our electronic platforms and our failure to monitor or maintain these systems or to find replacements for defective components within a system in a timely and costeffective manner when necessary could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business our customers rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate and highquality financial market data analytics and related solutions our timely reliable delivery of highquality products and services is subject to an array of technical production processes that enable our delivery platforms to leverage an extensive range of content databases our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

 we could experience system failures due to power or telecommunications failures human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyberattacks intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar events if any one or more of these situations were to arise they could result in damage to our business reputation and participant dissatisfaction with our electronic platform which could prompt participants to trade elsewhere or expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions as a consequence our business financial condition and operating results could suffer materially 

our regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time however we cannot 

assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in volume of order and trading transaction traffic and to provide processing and clearing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

we currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness 

as of december 31 2017 we had 61 billion of outstanding debt this level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities as we use our available resources to reduce and refinance our consolidated debt our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue future business opportunities may be further restrained in addition the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio test and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other matters further a significant portion of our outstanding debt has been in commercial paper which is subject to interest rate changes rising interest rates will result in an increase in our interest expense 

our longterm debt is currently rated by moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s these ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time and it is possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade our credit ratings in the future in particular our inability to sustain reduced debt on a consolidated basis may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings a significant downgrade of our credit ratings could impact customers’ willingness to use our clearing houses make parties less willing to do business with us and could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase the cost of any future debt funding we may obtain 

failure to evolve our benchmarks and indices in a manner that maintains the relevance of the benchmark or index damage to our reputation resulting from our administration of libor or other benchmarks and indices and the potential replacement of libor could adversely affect our business 

we operate multiple global benchmark products and indices across our asset classes and a significant portion of our volume is based on these products to ensure continued trading in our benchmark products and indices we must be able to demonstrate that our products are not readily subject to manipulation and we must continue to evolve our products to maintain their relevance our subsidiary iba is the administrator for various benchmarks including libor iba’s administration of libor is the result of the libor scandal which was a series of fraudulent actions taken by banks that were submitting false libor rates to profit from trades or to give the impression that the banks were more creditworthy than they were any failures or negative publicity resulting from our administration of libor or other benchmarks could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and could harm our business and our reputation 

in july 2017 the fca announced the desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 at this time it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes any establishment of alternative references rates or any other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the uk or elsewhere the elimination of libor or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may fail to complete or realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our recent acquisitions and future acquisitions which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we have completed many acquisitions and plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to integrate these businesses into our existing operations and realize anticipated cost savings revenue synergies and growth opportunities we generally set aggressive timelines for realizing savings   which assumes we successfully undertake a variety of actions including but not limited to integrating technology eliminating redundancies and effecting organizational restructurings that are themselves subject to a variety of risks and may be subject to regulatory approvals 

that we do not control the process of integrating acquired companies is time consuming and could disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties including inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants regulators and others require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of the business 

there is a risk however that we may not integrate these acquired companies in a manner that permits our expected cost savings and revenue synergies to be fully realized in the time periods expected or at all in addition a variety of factors including but not limited to regulatory conditions governmental competition approvals currency fluctuations and difficulty integrating technology platforms may adversely affect our ability to complete our acquisitions or realize our anticipated cost savings and synergies for example the uk competition and markets authority or cma ordered a divestment of trayport and such divestment was completed in december 2017 

we may also not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures or alliances that we have entered into or may enter into for a number of reasons including regulatory or government approvals or changes global market changes contractual obligations competing products and in some instances our lack of or limited control over the management of the business further strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future 

as a result of any future acquisition we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest expend cash incur debt assume actual and contingent liabilities inherit existing or pending litigation or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets further we cannot assure you that any such financing or equity investments will be available with terms that will be favorable to us or available at all 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

since we conduct operations in several different countries including the us uk eu and canada substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling euros and canadian dollars because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

external events such as brexit the negotiations regarding the terms of the uk’s exit from the eu the outcome of the us presidential election and the passage of us taxation reform legislation each have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially among the us dollar the british pound sterling and the euro if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the uk eu the us or other key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further the value of the pound sterling and euro and the global credit markets may further weaken general financial instability in countries in the eu could have a contagion effect on the region and contribute to the general instability and uncertainty in the eu events that adversely affect our uk and eu clients and suppliers could in turn have a materially adverse effect on our international business results and our operating results 

for additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk refer to “ foreign currency exchange rate risk” in item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk which is included in this annual report” 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill other intangible assets or investments

we may face liability for content contained in our data products and services 

we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation libel copyright or trademark infringement fraud or negligence or based on other theories of liability in each case relating to the data articles commentary ratings information or other content we distribute in our financial data services if such data or other content or information that we distribute has errors is delayed or has design defects we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our corporate website or those websites that we own and operate through links to other websites use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for significant amounts any such claim even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us could involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and a negative impact on our reputation 

in addition we license and redistribute data and content from various third parties and the terms of these licenses change frequently our third party data and content suppliers may audit our use of and our clients’ use of and payment for data and content from time to time in the ordinary course of business including audits currently underway such third party data and content suppliers may assert that we or our clients owe additional amounts under the terms of the applicable license agreements that we inappropriately distributed the third party data or that we or our clients used the data or content in a manner that exceeded the scope of the applicable license agreement we have and expect to continue to spend and allocate resources to develop and acquire the use of technology and other intellectual property rights to manage these risks and track third party data usage but we cannot be assured that we will not incur liability we may incur costs to investigate any allegations and may be required to pay damages to or make unexpected settlement payments to these data and content suppliers and these costs and payments could be material 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties including trademarks service marks trade names trade secrets copyrights and patents we cannot assure you that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property additionally we may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could harm our reputation and 

affect our ability to compete effectively further we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights which may require significant financial and managerial resources as a result we may choose not to enforce our infringed intellectual property rights depending on our strategic evaluation and judgment regarding the best use of our resources the relative strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the recourse available to us 

in addition our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may have obtained and may be expected to obtain in the future patent rights related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services as a result we may face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the holders of the patents or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patents we also could be required to pay damages if we were found to infringe patents held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we rely on third party providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of an important service data or content supplied by any third party or the loss of an exclusive license could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as online service providers hosting service and software providers data processors software and hardware vendors banks local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading clearing data services and other systems we rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with third parties and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for the provision of hosting services we also depend on thirdparty suppliers for data and content including data received from certain competitors clients various government and public record services and financial institutions used in our products and services some of this data is exclusive to particular suppliers and may not be obtained from other suppliers in addition our data suppliers could enter into exclusive contracts with our competitors without our knowledge the general trend toward industry consolidation may increase the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future if these companies were to discontinue providing services to us for any reason or fail to provide the type of service agreed to we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients or increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines our third party data suppliers perform audits on us from time to time in the ordinary course of business to determine if data we license for redistribution has been properly accounted for in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreement as a result of these audits we may incur additional expenses 

many of our clients also rely on third parties to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform if these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients’ inability to transact with our businesses we hold exclusive licenses to list various index futures and contracts in the future litigation or regulatory action may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and contracts trading to a single exchange and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license mifid ii introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of services relating to commodity derivatives across europe and the legislation requires open access to any benchmarks a benchmark is an index or other measure used to determine the value of a financial instrument for example libor or the sp 500 used in europe if unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive license were permitted we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products 

we are subject to significant litigation and liability risks 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our participants involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred for example dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platform or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades abusive trading practices security and confidentiality breaches mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants in addition because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by 

entering them inaccurately a large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets 

in addition we are subject to ongoing legal disputes that could result in the payment of fines penalties or damages and could expose us to additional liability in the future for example on december 19 2017 the us court of appeals for the second circuit or the second circuit issued its decision in city of providence v bats global markets et al two of our subsidiaries new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca inc are defendants in this case in vacating the district court’s dismissal of this lawsuit and remanding for further proceedings the second circuit concluded in part that the defendant securities exchanges are not immune from the claims in this case because absolute immunity is available to a selfregulatory organization like the new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca inc only when they carry out regulatory functions although our exchanges will continue to have other defenses available to them in securities litigation cases including in this matter limitations on the doctrine of absolute immunity could result in an increased exposure to litigation and to increased liability andor other legal expenses 

further we could incur significant expenses defending claims even those without merit which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us including those we are involved with due to acquisition activity may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition we may have to establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for a summary of our legal proceedings and claims 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

given our prominence in the global securities industry and the location of many of our properties and personnel in us and european financial centers including lower manhattan we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees in addition terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets including trading on exchanges any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

damage to our reputation could damage our business 

our business is highly competitive and our customers typically have options on where to conduct their business our management team and business operations benefit from being highly regarded in our industry maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and for maintaining our relationships with our regulators negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services operations risk management compliance with regulations or management team could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our existing business and business prospects 

owning and operating voice broker and electronic fixed income brokerage businesses exposes us to additional risk and these businesses are largely dependent on general market conditions 

our voice broker business provides brokerage services to clients in the form of agency transactions in commodity products in agency transactions customers pay transaction fees for trade execution services in which we connect buyers and sellers who settle their transactions directly in connection with our fixed income business our brokerdealers operate in both an agency and in a matched principal capacity also known as “riskless principal” when trading as matched principal we agree to buy instruments from one customer and sell them to another customer the amount of the fee generally depends on the spread between the buy and sell price of the security that is brokered with respect to matched principal transactions a counterparty to a matched principal transaction may fail to fulfill its obligations or we may face liability for an unmatched trade we also face the risk of not being able to collect transaction or processing fees charged to customers for brokerage services and processing services we provide 

we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt is dividends from our subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ice 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for ice these provisions make a change of control less likely which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of us and european equity exchanges for example our organizational documents include provisions that generally restrict any person either alone or together with its related persons from i voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10 of our outstanding voting capital stock including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock or ii beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock further our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to call special stockholders’ meetings or act by written consent and generally authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock in addition provisions of delaware law may have a similar effect such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders as defined under delaware law from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the board of directors

we are subject to legal proceedings claims and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business we establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change assessments of losses are inherently subjective and involve unpredictable factors we do not believe that the resolution of these legal matters including the matters described below will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially and adversely affected by any developments relating to the legal proceedings claims and investigations see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report for a summary of our legal proceedings and claims

as a holding company we have no operations and rely upon dividends from our subsidiaries in order to provide liquidity necessary to service our debt obligations and make dividend payments to our shareholders we and our subsidiaries are all required to comply with legal and regulatory restrictions including restrictions contained in applicable general corporate laws regarding the declaration and payment of dividends these laws may limit our or our subsidiaries’ ability to declare and pay dividends from time to time 

none of the indentures governing our and our subsidiaries’ outstanding indebtedness contain specific covenants restricting our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends absent a default on such indebtedness our senior unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate amount of 34 billion  however limits our ability to declare and make dividend payments and other distributions of our cash property or assets if a default under the applicable facility has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a result of our declaration and payment of any dividend or other distribution our senior unsecured revolving credit facility contains customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on our operations including our maintenance of specified total leverage and interest coverage ratios which could indirectly affect our ability to pay dividends refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for more information on our debt facilities

 business environment and market trends 

our business environment has been characterized by industry consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading clearing and listings the globalization of exchanges customers and competitors market participants’ rising demand for speed data capacity and connectivity which requires ongoing investment in technology evolving and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions and increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies 

price volatility increases the need to hedge risk and creates demand among market participants for the exchange of risk through trading and clearing market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market’s strength in addition the ability to evolve existing products to serve emerging needs develop new products and respond to competitive dynamics in pricing exclusivity and consolidation is important to our business changes in these and other factors could cause our revenues to fluctuate from period to period and these fluctuations may affect the reliability of period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results for additional information regarding the factors that affect our results of operations see item 1a “ risk factors” included elsewhere in this annual report 

the implementation of new laws or regulations or the uncertainty around potential changes may impact participation in our markets or the demand for our clearing and data services either favorably or unfavorably many of the recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets centralized clearing and access to data all of which are important aspects of our product offering however some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented on january 3 2018 are being reconsidered in addition some of the global regulations have 

not been fully harmonized and several of the mifid ii regulations are inconsistent with us rules as this is established legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data as a result it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us as discussed more fully in item 1 “ business  regulation” included elsewhere in this annual report the implementation of mifid ii and other regulations may result in operational regulatory andor business risk 

in recent years low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a relatively slow or yet to occur global economic recovery lower growth in asia and the eu may also continue to affect global financial markets in addition economic and regulatory uncertainty coupled with periods of high market volatility around geopolitical events low interest rates and low natural gas prices has affected our clients’ activities in recent years the duration of these trends will determine the continued impact on our business across trading and listings we have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class in addition we have increased our portion of nontransaction and clearing revenues from 21 in 2013 to 58 in 2017 this nontransaction revenue includes data services listings and other revenues we continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams as well as on our companywide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data clearing and markets 

many of the data products and services we sell are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels we anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends including the following increasing global regulatory demands greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations greater emphasis on risk management market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes the move to passive investing and indexation ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets increased electronification of fixed income and other less automated markets the development of new data products the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity new entrants and increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions we contract with clients through data fixedfee subscriptions variable fees based on usage or a combination of fixedfee subscription and usagebased fees in addition some of our data services generate onetime or nonrecurring revenue such as onetime purchases of historical data setup services or implementation fees 

segment reporting 

we operate two business segments our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment this presentation is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviews and operates our business our trading and clearing segment comprises our transactionbased execution and clearing businesses our data and listings segment comprises our subscriptionbased data services and securities listings businesses our chief operating decision maker does not review total assets intersegment revenuesexpenses or statements of income below operating income by segments therefore such information is not presented below 

while revenues are allocated directly to segments a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of both segments because these expenses do not relate to a single segment we have employed a reasonable allocation method to allocate expenses between the segments for presentation purposes we have elected to use a prorata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment further precise allocation of expenses to specific revenue streams within these segments is not reasonably possible accordingly we did not allocate expenses to specific revenue streams within the segments 

certain prior year’s segment expenses for 2016 have been reclassified to conform to our current year’s segment financial statement presentation this reclassification increased the operating expenses for the data and listings segment by 55 million while decreasing the operating expenses for the trading and clearing segment by the same amount 

trading and clearing segment

transaction and clearing revenues 

overview 

our transaction and clearing revenues are reported on a net basis except for the nyse transactionbased expenses discussed below and consist of fees collected from our derivatives cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing in our derivatives markets we earn transaction and clearing revenues from both counterparties to each contract that is traded andor cleared and in our equity and equity options markets we receive trade execution fees as well as routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution 

rates percontract are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract net of certain rebates our percontract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors including but not limited to market conditions transaction and clearing volume product mix pricing applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements and new product introductions because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a percontract basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and due to product mix 

for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  20 19 and 20 respectively of our trading and clearing segment revenues less transactionbased expenses were billed in pounds sterling or euros as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes the us equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the us dollar our trading and clearing segment revenues less transactionbased expenses were lower by 14 million for the year ended december 31 2017  from the comparable period in 2016  and were lower by 35 million for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk” below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations 

our transaction and clearing fees are presented net of rebates we recorded rebates of 749 million 674 million and 563 million for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded the increase in the rebates is due primarily to an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts an increase in our traded volume and an increase in the number of rebate programs 

commodities markets 

we operate global crude oil and refined oil futures markets including the ice brent ice wti and ice gasoil futures and options contracts as well as over 500 refined oil futures products that relate to our benchmark futures contracts and other key price benchmarks the ice brent crude contract is relied upon by a broad range of global market participants including oil producing nations and multinational companies to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption ice gasoil is a key refined 

oil benchmark in europe and asia total oil volume and revenues increased 14 and 12 respectively for the year ended december 31 2017  from the comparable period in 2016  and increased 12 and 10 respectively for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  crude oil revenues grew at a slightly lower rate due to customer and product mix 

in 2017  ice brent crude futures and options contracts were traded at record levels for the twentyfirst consecutive year ice brent crude futures and options volume increased 15 for the year ended december 31 2017  from the comparable period in 2016  and increased 15 for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  ice wti crude futures and options volume increased 14 for the year ended december 31 2017  from the comparable period in 2016  and increased 16 for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  ice brent crude and ice wti crude futures and options volume increased primarily due to increased oil price volatility related to shifting supply and demand dynamics globally broader market volatility in oil products equities and foreign exchange rates acts of central governments outcomes of elections and uncertainty around the organization of petroleum exporting countries or opec policy 

our global natural gas futures and options volume declined 1 and revenues decreased 1 for the year ended december 31 2017  from the comparable period in 2016  respectively and volume declined 2 and revenues increased 4 for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  respectively global natural gas revenues decreased in 2017 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation in our european natural gas products global natural gas volume declined in 2016 primarily due to lower price volatility related to high natural gas supplies but revenues increased due to geographic product mix 

total volume and revenues in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets decreased 7 and 5 respectively for the year ended december 31 2017  from the comparable period in 2016  and increased 11 and 8 respectively for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  the decreases in agricultural volume in 2017 were primarily driven by the reduced price volatility in 2017 compared to the higher price volatility in 2016 the increases in agricultural volume in 2016 were primarily driven by increased price volatility due to changing supply and demand expectations largely related to weather and production levels 

financial markets 

interest rates and other financial futures and options volume and revenues increased 15 and 2 respectively for the year ended december 31 2017  from the comparable period in 2016  and volume increased 10 and revenues decreased 6 respectively for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  interest rate futures and options volume increased in 2017 primarily due to expectations for heightened central bank activity during 2017 and volume increased in 2016 primarily due to uncertainty around central bank actions economic data during 2016 and the uk’s decision to exit the eu interest rate futures and options revenues increased less than traded volumes in 2017 and in 2016 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and increased market making rebates that apply at higher volume levels 

cash equities handled volume decreased 17 for the year ended december 31 2017  from the comparable period in 2016  primarily due to a reduction in us equities market volatility during 2017 compared to the prior year cash equities handled volume increased 6 for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  primarily due to increased market volatility throughout 2016 cash equities revenues net of transactionbased expenses were 196 million 223 million and 220 million for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

equity options volume decreased 13 for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the same period in 2016  and decreased 5 for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  equity options revenues net of transactionbased expenses were 90 million 98 million and 112 million for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively equity options volume and revenues decreased the last several years primarily due to lower us equity market volatility in 2017 and the restructuring of the nyse american options business while revenues declined the last several years the overall financial contribution of equity options was consistent with the prior years due to the retention of a higher percentage of profits from nyse american options driven by our repurchase of the equity in the exchange from the minority shareholders 

cds clearing revenues were 113 million 107 million and 100 million for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the notional value of cds cleared during the same periods were 115 trillion 115 trillion and 119 trillion respectively buyside participation at our us cds clearing house ice clear credit reached record levels in terms of number of participants and notional cleared due to increased participation from both us and european buyside customers due to greater regulatory certainty the breadth of products offered and cost efficient margining in the us relative to europe 

cds trade execution revenues were 27 million 36 million and 49 million for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively cds trading remains muted due to financial reform and lower volatility in corporate credit markets the 

decrease in the cds trade execution revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  is also impacted by the sale and discontinuance of our us and uk cds voice brokerage operations in the third quarter of 2016 

other revenues 

other revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits regulatory penalties and fines fees for use of our facilities regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our us securities exchanges designated market maker service fees exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees the increase in other revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  from the comparable period in 2016 is primarily due to a 6 million breakup fee received in the third quarter of 2017 related to the termination of the derivatives clearing agreement with euronext under which ice clear netherlands was to provide clearing of euronext’s financial and commodity derivatives

transactionbased expenses   

our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue these section 31 fees are designed to recover the government’s costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals we in turn collect activity assessment fees which are included in transaction and clearing revenues in our consolidated statements of income from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts when invoiced the activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the section 31 fees that are included in transactionbased expenses in our consolidated statements of income as a result activity assessment fees and the corresponding section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income activity assessment fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and as required by law the amount due to the sec is remitted semiannually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid as of december 31 2017  the accrued liability related to the unremitted sec section 31 fees was 128 million

1 the adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance as a result these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with us gaap see “ nongaap financial measures” below 

the data and listings segment represents subscriptionbased or recurring revenues from data services and listings services offered across our trading and clearing businesses and ice data services through ice data services we generate revenues from a range of market data services including the dissemination of our exchange and evaluated pricing data and analytics desktops connectivity and market data through nyse nyse american and nyse arca we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and etfs and related corporate actions for listed companies 

for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  10 12 and 4 respectively of our data and listings segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros all relating to our data services revenues as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes the us equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the us dollar our data services revenues were lower by 8 million for the year ended december 31 2017  from the comparable period in 2016  and were lower by 24 million for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  

data services revenues 

our pricing and analytics services consist of an extensive set of independent evaluated pricing services focused primarily on fixed income and international equity securities valuation services reference data market data end of day pricing fixed income equity portfolio analytics and risk management analytics we also serve as an administrator of regulated benchmarks our index services offer a range of products across fixed income energy equities etfs and other asset classes to provide the methodology pricing and licensing of indices and benchmarks 

our exchange data revenues primarily represent subscription fees for the provision of our market data that is created from activity on our exchanges which is driven by the products and technology we develop to deliver realtime views of markets and related information in our derivatives markets exchange data revenues relate to subscription fees charged for customer and license access from third party data vendors or quote vendors such as thomson reuters corporation and bloomberg and from end users as well as viewonly data access direct access services terminal access daily indices forward curves and end of day reports 

we also earn exchange data revenues relating to our cash equity and options markets and related data services we collect cash trading market data fees principally for consortiumbased data products and to a lesser extent for nyse proprietary data 

products consortiumbased data fees are determined by the securities industry plans and are charged to vendors based on their redistribution of data consortiumbased data revenues net of administrative costs are distributed to participating securities markets on the basis of a formula set by the sec under regulation nms last trade prices and quotes in nyselisted nyse americanlisted and nyse arcalisted securities are disseminated through “tape a” and “tape b” which constitute the majority of our revenues from consortiumbased market data revenues

our data services revenues increased the last two years primarily due to the strong retention rate of existing customers the addition of new customers increased purchases by existing customers the development of new and enhanced products serving the need for an expanded range of data regulatory compliance and analytics solutions and our acquisitions of interactive data and trayport in december 2015 and of securities evaluations and credit market analysis in october 2016 these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and the divestitures of idms and trayport in our desktop and connectivity business we recognized 11 billion in data services revenues for interactive data trayport securities evaluations and credit market analysis during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 50 million in data services revenues for interactive data and trayport from the comparable period in 2015  subsequent to their acquisitions dates 

organic annual subscription value 

organic annual subscription value or asv represents at a point in time the data services revenues subscribed for the succeeding twelve months asv does not include new sales contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that twelvemonth period asv also does not include certain data services revenue streams that are not subscriptionbased asv is adjusted for material acquisitions divestitures or discontinued businesses to provide an organic view of comparable performance on a year over year basis at a beginning of the quarter thus while it is an indicative forwardlooking metric it does not provide a growth forecast of the next twelve months of data services revenues 

as of december 31 2017  asv was 18 billion a 6 increase compared to asv of 17 billion as of december 31 2016  underpinning this growth is strength in both our pricing and analytics business and our connectivity services 

listings revenues

the majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance as discussed below the following chart and table present our consolidated operating expenses dollars in millions 



we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with our acquisitions and growth of our business and to vary from year to year based on the type and level of our acquisitions our integrations and other investments 

for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  14 18 and 12 respectively of our consolidated operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes the us equivalent of operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the us dollar our consolidated operating expenses were lower by 14 million for the year ended december 31 2017  from the comparable period in 2016  and were lower by 40 million for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk” below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations 

compensation and benefits expenses 

compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes noncapitalized employee wages bonuses noncash or stock compensation certain severance costs benefits and employer taxes the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance and the performancebased restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance therefore our compensation and benefits expense will vary year to year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in the number of employees 

as of december 31 2017  we had 4952 employees compared to 5631 employees as of december 31 2016  and 5549 employees as of december 31 2015 our employee headcount decreased as of december 31 2017 primarily due to the divestitures in 2017 of idms trayport and nyse governance services and employee terminations in connection with our integration of interactive data partially offset by the acquisitions of ngx and tmx atrium in 2017 our employee headcount increased as of december 31 2016 and 2015 primarily due to acquisitions of securities evaluations credit market analysis interactive data and trayport during 2016 and 2015 converting contractor roles to employees at nyse and hiring for clearing technology regulation and compliance see “ recent developments” above 

compensation and benefits expenses increased for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to the increases in our employee headcount we recognized 342 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to the interactive data trayport securities evaluations and credit market analysis acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 17 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to the interactive data and trayport acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2015 subsequent to their acquisitions 

we recorded 17 million 33 million and 20 million in nyse and interactive data employee severance costs during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively with such costs included in the acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs discussed below and primarily related to executive departures in addition we incurred nonacquisitionrelated employee severance costs of 21 million 10 million and 3 million for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

noncash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were 135 million 123 million and 111 million for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the increase in noncash compensation expenses in 2017 primarily relates to the integration of the interactive data employees into the ice noncash incentive plans and the increase in 2016 primarily relates to a greater number of employees receiving noncash awards due to the headcount increases discussed above 

professional services expenses 

this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives temporary labor as well as regulatory legal and accounting fees this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services temporary labor and regulatory accounting and legal proceedings 

professional services expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to the continued reduction in professional services and contractors at nyse we eliminated or replaced certain contractor positions with fulltime employees at nyse in 2016 and 2015 in addition during the year ended december 31 2016  we recorded a credit from a third party service provider related to fees charged during 2015 and we incurred lower legal fees during the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015 legal fees which are included in professional services expenses primarily related to class action lawsuits in which nyse is a defendant these decreases were partially offset by professional services expenses incurred by interactive data trayport securities evaluations and credit market analysis following their acquisitions in 2016 and 2015 

acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs 

we incurred 36 million  in acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31 2017  primarily relating to our integrations of interactive data securities evaluations and credit market analysis and our acquisitions of

we incurred 88 million in acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs during the year ended december 31 2015 primarily relating to our acquisitions of interactive data and trayport and the integration of nyse of this amount 46 million was primarily related to the acquisition costs we incurred 42 million for nyse integration costs during the year ended december 31 2015 primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs 

we expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth as a result we may incur acquisitionrelated transaction costs in future periods see “ nongaap financial measures” below 

technology and communication expenses 

technology support services consist of costs for running our whollyowned data centers hosting costs paid to thirdparty data centers and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology these costs are driven by system capacity functionality and redundancy requirements communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms telecommunications costs and fees paid for access to external market data this expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume our capacity requirements changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly 

technology and communications expenses increased the last two years primarily due to technology expenses incurred by interactive data trayport securities evaluations and credit market analysis following their acquisitions in 2016 and 2015 in addition during the last two years we incurred increased hardware and software support costs related to our trading and clearing platforms and our data services 

rent and occupancy expenses 

this expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent maintenance real estate taxes utilities and other related costs we have significant operations located in and around atlanta new york and london with smaller offices located throughout the world see item 2 “ properties” above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property 

the increase in rent and occupancy expenses for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015 is primarily due to rent and occupancy expenses relating to interactive data trayport securities evaluations and credit market analysis subsequent to their acquisitions excluding the impact of the acquisitions rent and occupancy expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to reduced rent and occupancy costs realized due to the continued consolidation of our atlanta new york and london office locations 

selling general and administrative expenses 

this expense relates to expenses from marketing advertising public relations insurance bank service charges dues and subscriptions travel and entertainment nonincome taxes and other general and administrative costs 

selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december 31 2017  from the comparable period in 2016 primarily due to the acquisitions of securities evaluations and credit market analysis and 14 million in accruals relating to ongoing investigations and inquiries during the year ended december 31 2017  refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for more information on the ongoing investigations and inquiries selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to selling general and administrative expenses incurred by interactive data trayport securities evaluations and credit market analysis following their acquisitions in 2016 and 2015 excluding the impact of the acquisitions selling general and administrative expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to the release of nonincome taxrelated reserves and lower marketing expenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses 

depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of longlived assets such as buildings leasehold improvements planes furniture fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses as well as on various licensing agreements over their estimated useful lives intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships trading products with finite lives and technology this expense also includes amortization of internally developed and purchased software over their estimated useful lives 

we recorded amortization expenses on the intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions as well as on the other intangible assets of 272 million 323 million and 160 million for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the decrease in the amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets for the year ended december 31 2017  from the comparable period in 2016 is primarily due to a reduction in amortization expenses recorded on intangible assets which became fully amortized primarily related to certain of the nyse intangible assets and the divestitures of trayport and nyse governance services partially offset by amortization expenses recorded on the securities evaluations credit market analysis ngx and tmx atrium intangible assets the increase in the amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015 is primarily due to amortization expenses recorded on the interactive data trayport securities evaluations and credit market analysis intangible assets following their acquisitions 

in addition we recognized a net loss of 6 million on the sale of nyse governance services which was recorded in depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december 31 2017 see “ recent developments” above and we recorded an impairment of the creditex customer relationship intangible asset of 33 million which was recorded in depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december 31 2016 in august 2016 we sold certain of creditex’s us voice brokerage operations to tullett prebon during the third quarter of 2016 we discontinued creditex’s uk voice brokerage operations we continue to operate creditex’s electronically traded markets and systems posttrade connectivity platforms and intellectual property in connection with the divestiture of the voice brokerage business it was determined that the carrying value of the cds creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in september 2016 for 33 million

consolidated nonoperating income expenses 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating the following tables present our nonoperating income expenses dollars in millions 



interest expense increased for the year ended december 31 2017  from the comparable period in 2016  primarily due to interest expense that we recognized relating to the 10 billion in senior notes issued in august 2017 partially offset by the repayment of 850 million of the 200 senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in october 2017 or the nyse notes in september 2017 interest expense increased for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to the interest expense we recognized on the additional debt incurred to finance the interactive data acquisition in december 2015 see “ debt” below 

on december 14 2017 we sold trayport to tmx group for £550 million   733 million  based on the pound sterlingus dollar exchange rate of 13331  as of december 14 2017 we recognized a net gain of 110 million  on the divestiture of trayport which was recorded as other income for the year ended december 31 2017  see “ recent developments  divestiture of trayport and the acquisitions of ngx and shorcan energy” above

investment gain” above we recognized dividend income received relating to our investment in cetip in other income which was 5 million 17 million and 16 million for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we no longer receive any dividends from cetip subsequent to its sale in the first quarter of 2017 

 we account for our investments in mers and the options clearing corporation or occ as equity method investments we recognized 36 million 25 million and 6 million in equity income related to these investments during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively as other income 

we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of 4 million 1 million and 14 million for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively this was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income expense and relate to the settlement of foreign currency assets liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in nonfunctional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the periodend foreign currency exchange rates between periods see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk” included elsewhere in this annual report for more information on these items 

we recognized interest income on our investments of 8 million 3 million and 6 million during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively which were recorded as other income during the year ended december 31 2015  we incurred 15 million in settlements and accruals for various outstanding legal matters net of insurance proceeds which was recorded in other expense 

for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100 and for which we have control over the assets liabilities and management of the entity the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2016 noncontrolling interest included those related to the operating results of our cds clearing subsidiaries in which nonice limited partners held a 425 net profit sharing interest ice endex in which gasunie held a 21 ownership interest and ice clear netherlands in which abn amro clearing held a 25 ownership interest for both ice endex and ice clear netherlands in addition to the noncontrolling interest reported in the consolidated statements of income we reported redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets which represents the minority interest redemption fair value for each company 

during june 2017 we purchased both gasunie’s 21  minority ownership interest in ice endex and abn amro clearing’s 25  minority ownership interest in ice clear netherlands subsequent to these acquisitions we own 100  of ice endex and ice clear netherlands and will no longer include any noncontrolling interest amounts for ice endex and ice clear netherlands in our consolidated financial statements during the year ended december 31 2017 we purchased 126  of the net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries from several nonice limited partners and the remaining nonice limited partners hold a 299  net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 

consolidated income tax provision 

consolidated income tax expense benefit was 25 million  580 million  and 358 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the change in consolidated income tax expense benefit between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pretax income and the changes in our effective tax rate each year our effective tax rate was 1  29  and 22  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable us and uk tax law changes and favorable foreign income tax rate differentials partially offset by state income taxes favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower income tax rates in the uk and various other lower tax jurisdictions as compared to the historical income tax rates in the us 

 during the fourth quarter of 2015 the uk reduced their corporate income tax rate from 20  to 19  effective april 1 2017 and to 18  effective april 1 2020 during the third quarter of 2016 the uk further reduced their corporate income tax rate from 18  to 17  effective april 1 2020 during december 2017 the tcja reduced the us corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  effective january 1 2018 see “ recent developments” above the reduction in us and uk corporate income tax rates resulted in deferred tax benefits in the respective periods of enactment the impact of the deferred tax benefits for the us and uk corporate income tax rate reductions for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  lowered the effective tax rates by 30  2  and 4  respectively and resulted in deferred tax benefits of 764 million  34 million  and 60 million  respectively 

the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017  from the comparable period in 2016  is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with the future us income tax rate reduction and tax benefits associated with a divestiture in the second quarter of 2017 partially offset by the deferred tax benefit from the uk corporate income tax reduction in the third quarter of 2016 additional tax expense from an illinois corporate income tax rate increase enacted in the third quarter of 2017 and an income tax expense increase due to a relatively higher us mix of income in 2017 the increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  is primarily due to the tax impact of foreign versus us based pretax income lower deferred tax benefits associated with the future uk income tax rate reductions and greater favorable settlements with 

various taxing authorities in 2015 partially offset by a tax benefit from the early adoption of asu 201609 in 2016 see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere is this annual report for additional information on these tax items 

quarterly results of operations

1 the increase in the depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended september 30 2016 is primarily due to the 33 million creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment see “ consolidated operating expenses” above 

2 other income expense net for the three months ended december 31 2017 includes a 110 million gain on our sale of trayport and for the three months ended march 31 2017 includes a 176 million realized investment gain in connection with the sale of our investment in cetip see “ recent developments” above 

3 the decrease in the income tax expenses for the three months ended december 31 2017 is primarily due to a 764 million deferred tax benefit associated with future us income tax reductions the decrease for the three months ended june 30 2017 is primarily due to the tax benefit associated with a divestiture and the decrease for the three months ended september 30 2016 is primarily due to a deferred tax benefit associated with future uk income tax rate reductions see “ consolidated income tax provision” above 

liquidity and capital resources 

below are charts that reflect our capital allocation the acquisition and integration costs in the chart below includes both the net cash paid for the acquisitions and the acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs in each year 

we have financed our operations growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures working capital strategic acquisitions and investments stock repurchases dividends to our shareholders and the continued development of our technology platforms that support our businesses we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt as it matures in the future we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities which we may be unable to do or to do on favorable terms see “ future capital requirements” below 

our commercial paper program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable shortterm interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to delever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities we reduced our outstanding commercial paper during the year ended december 31 2017  by 409 million primarily using net cash proceeds received from the sale of our investment in cetip the sale of trayport and cash flows from operations partially offset by acquisitions and investments we made in 2017 see “ debt” below 

see “ recent developments” above for a discussion of the acquisitions and investments that we made during the year ended december 31 2017  these cash acquisitions and investments were funded from borrowing under our commercial paper program cash flows from operations and a portion of the proceeds received from our divestitures during the year ended december 31 2017  

upon maturity of old issuances of commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper to mitigate the rollover risk we maintain an undrawn backstop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper program if we were not able to issue new commercial paper we have the option of drawing on the backstop revolving facility however electing to do so would result in higher interest expense see “ debt” below 

consolidated cash and cash equivalents were 535 million  and 407 million  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively we had 10 billion  and 943 million  in shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively and 432 million  in longterm investments as of december 31 2016 relating to our investment in cetip which was sold in 2017 we consider all shortterm highlyliquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents we classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as shortterm investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as longterm investments cash and investments that are 

not available for general use either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements are classified as restricted cash and investments 

as of december 31 2017  the amount of unrestricted cash held by our nonus subsidiaries was 325 million while we consider our nonus earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas if these cash balances are needed for our operations in the us any repatriation by way of dividend may be subject to both us federal and state income taxes as adjusted for any nonus tax credits such dividends may not be subject to us federal tax under the tcja and we will continue to monitor both federal and state interpretations guidance and regulations concerning us tax reform however we do not have any current needs or foreseeable future needs or other plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our nonus subsidiaries we will continue to evaluate our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of any further us tax reform developments 

our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of nonspeculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash such as overnight deposits term deposits money market funds mutual funds for treasury investments short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets we may invest a portion of our cash in excess of shortterm operating needs in investmentgrade marketable debt securities including government or governmentsponsored agencies and corporate debt securities 

certain of these investments with an original maturity of greater than three months will be classified as availableforsale in accordance with relevant accounting standards availableforsale investments are carried at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income realized gains and losses and declines in value deemed to be otherthantemporary on availableforsale investments are recognized currently in earnings we do not have any investments classified as heldtomaturity or trading 

during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  we repurchased 14966616  shares 902920  shares and 14343845  shares respectively of our outstanding common stock at a cost of 949 million  50 million  and 660 million  respectively the shares repurchased are held in treasury stock these repurchases were completed on the open market and under our rule 10b51 trading plan in connection with our acquisition of interactive data during the fourth quarter of 2015 we suspended our stock repurchase plan for a period of time the timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a rule 10b51 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions our management periodically reviews whether or not to be active in repurchasing our stock in making a determination regarding any stock repurchases we consider multiple factors the factors may include overall stock market conditions our common stock price movements the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board of directors the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings our expected free cash flow and working capital needs our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources 

in august 2016 our board of directors approved an aggregate of 10 billion  for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date in september 2017 our board of directors approved an aggregate of 12 billion  for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that becomes effective as of january 1 2018 we expect funding for any share repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our debt facilities or our commercial paper program 

repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market through established trading plans in privatelynegotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with all applicable securities laws rules and regulations we have entered into a rule 10b51 trading plan as authorized by our board of directors to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock we may discontinue the stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate the rule 10b51 trading plan at any time the approval of our board of directors for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock in addition our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities are primarily attributable to increases and decreases in our net income between periods and due to fluctuations in working capital 

the 64 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2017  from the comparable period in 2016  is primarily due to a 136 million contribution that was made to our pension plan in september 2017 compared to a 10 million contribution that was made to our pension plan in september 2016 the pension contribution in september 2017 allowed us to reach 99 funding of our pension obligation and allowed us to immunize the liability against future market fluctuations for additional information on our pension plan refer to note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report 

the 838 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  is primarily due to 393 million in cash provided by operating activities for interactive data trayport securities evaluations and credit market analysis for the year ended december 31 2016  increase in the net income of our historical income statement excluding the acquisitions and other fluctuations in working capital including the impact of the increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2015

future capital requirements 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate of growth across our trading and clearing and data and listings segments strategic plans and acquisitions available sources for financing activities required technology and clearing initiatives regulatory requirements the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products the geographic mix of our business potential stock repurchases and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic trading and clearing platforms we currently expect to make aggregate capital expenditures including operational and real estate capital expenditures and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between 300 million and 330 million for the year ended december 31 2018 which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology business integration and the continued growth of our businesses 

our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board of directors or the audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio during the year ended december 31 2017  we paid cash dividends of 080 per share of our common stock in the aggregate including 2017  quarterly dividends of 020 per share for an aggregate payout of 476 million in 2017  which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units refer to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years for the first quarter of 2018 we announced a 024 per share dividend which is a 20 increase over the prior dividend which is payable on march 29 2018 to shareholders of record as of march 15 2018 

as of december 31 2017  we had 61 billion  in outstanding debt we currently have a  34 billion  amended credit facility after factoring in the  12 billion  required to backstop the commercial paper program as of december 31 2017  and 100 million that is required to support certain subsidiary clearing house commitments  21 billion  of our amended credit facility is currently available for general corporate purposes the amended credit facility and our commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have with third parties for liquidity and capital resources in the event of any strategic acquisitions mergers or investments or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders we may incur additional debt issue additional equity to raise necessary funds repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend however we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us see “ debt” above 

nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than gaap measures alone in addition we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for periodtoperiod comparison of results because the items described below as adjustments to gaap are not reflective of our core business performance these financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to gaap financial measures and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance we strongly recommend that investors review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 

adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income attributable to ice common shareholders and adjusted earnings per share for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments in millions except for percentages and per share amounts 



acquisitionrelated transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses except for those that are directly related to the announcement closing financing or termination of a transaction however the acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs relating to interactive data and nyse are included in nongaap adjustments given the sizes of these acquisitions as of june 30 2016 the integration of nyse has been completed and we will no longer include any nyse integration costs as nongaap 

adjustments following this date amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles are included in nongaap adjustments as excluding these noncash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results 

during the year ended december 31 2017 we include as nongaap adjustments the cetip realized investment gain and the foreign exchange loss and transaction expenses on the sale of our investment in cetip as the sale of our investment in cetip is not part of our core business operations during the year ended december 31 2017 we include as nongaap adjustments the net gain on the divestiture of trayport the accruals relating to ongoing investigations and inquiries and the nyse governance services net loss on its divestiture as they are nonrecurring items during the year ended december 31 2016 we include as nongaap adjustments the creditex uk voice brokerage severance costs related to its discontinuance and the creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense as they are nonrecurring items during the year ended december 31 2015 we include as nongaap adjustments various litigation settlements and accruals and the interest expense on the senior notes and commercial paper we issued for the interactive data acquisition from the issuance date of the new senior notes on november 24 2015 and on the issuance dates of the commercial paper in early december 2015 to the acquisition date of interactive data on december 14 2015 as they are not part of our core business operations or represent nonrecurring items 

the income tax effects relating to the items above are included in nongaap adjustments as well as deferred tax adjustments on acquisitionrelated intangibles and other tax adjustments the tax items in nongaap adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pretax nongaap adjustments or are tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance 

the income tax effects of the pretax nongaap adjustments for the year ended december 31 2017 include tax benefits associated with the divestiture of nyse governance services the tax adjustments on us tax reform mainly include the 764 million deferred tax benefit as a result of the enactment of tcja in the last quarter of 2017 which reduces the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 deferred tax adjustments on acquisitionrelated intangibles include the impact of us state tax law and apportionment changes which resulted in deferred tax expense of 10 million deferred tax expense of 12 million and deferred tax benefits of 22 million for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively in addition deferred tax adjustments on acquisitionrelated intangibles include 34 million and 60 million deferred tax benefits due to uk corporate income tax rate reductions for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively other tax adjustments for the year ended december 31 2016 relate to a 15 million valuation allowance on singapore preacquisition net operating losses and other deferred tax assets and an 8 million deferred tax adjustment with respect to our occ equity method investment other tax adjustments for the year ended december 31 2015 represents a 7 million uncertain tax position relating to a retrospective foreign tax law change for a preacquisition period

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table presents for the periods indicated our contractual obligations which we intend to fund from our existing cash as well as cash flow from operations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2017  in millions 



purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum 

quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above 512 billion in cash margin deposits guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund the cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them ngx administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts it has an equal and offsetting claim to and from their respective participants on opposite sides of the physically settled contract this balance is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable 

we have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits or utbs from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above as of december 31 2017  our cumulative utbs were 115 million interest and penalties related to utbs were 35 million as of december 31 2017  we are under examination by various tax authorities we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax interest and penalties if any that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our utbs 

as of december 31 2017  in connection with our acquisition of nyse we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs the date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs 

we have a 40 ownership in occ under the occ’s capital plan the occ shareholders have committed to contribute up to 200 million in equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached including up to 80 million to be contributed by nyse which has also been excluded from the table above 

new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us 

critical accounting policies 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the accounting matters described below we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments based on these factors we make estimates and judgments about among other things the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies among others affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results assets and liabilities 

goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 

we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired including other identified intangible assets we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift our judgments may change which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances as of december 31 2017  we had goodwill of 122 billion and net other intangible assets of 103 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

in performing the purchase price allocation we consider among other factors the intended future use of acquired assets analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business at the acquisition date a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation we continue to review and validate estimates assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period accordingly these estimates and assumptions are subject to change which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition 

our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill of the reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangibles to its estimated fair value we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we have identified four reporting units our futures reporting unit our data and listings reporting unit our cash equities reporting unit and our cds reporting unit 

goodwill impairment testing consists of a twostep methodology the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value including goodwill and other intangible assets of such reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no impairment loss is recognized and the second step which is a calculation of the impairment is not performed however if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value for annual goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill and other intangible assets if we conclude that this is the case we must perform the twostep methodology described above otherwise we can skip the twostep methodology and do not need to perform any further testing for annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount 

application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows longterm growth rates of our business operating margins discount rates weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets these estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment and changes to these estimates and assumptions as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor impairment the cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and when applicable various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of our business adverse market conditions adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations competition or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill through december 31 2017  

we are also required to evaluate other finitelived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable if impairment indicators are present then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these longlived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable if an asset is not recoverable the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis 

in august 2016 we sold certain of creditex’s us voice brokerage operations to tullett prebon during the third quarter of 2016 we discontinued creditex’s uk voice brokerage operations we continue to operate creditex’s electronically traded markets and systems posttrade connectivity platforms and intellectual property after the sale and the discontinuance of the voice brokerage operations it was determined that the carrying value of the cds creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in september 2016 for 33 million the impairment was recorded as amortization expense in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2016 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us uk and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse 

sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 or sab 118 has provided guidance for companies that have not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja in the period of enactment allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts as of december 31 2017 we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tcja however we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our deferred tax balances and in relation to the transition tax in other cases we have not been able to make a reasonable estimate and will continue to analyze the tcja in order to finalize any related impacts within the measurement period the fasb staff also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of global intangible lowtaxed income or gilti noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred we have not completed our analysis of the effects of the gilti provisions and will further consider the accounting policy election within the measurement period as provided for under sab 118 

we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position if the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 

we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter at any point in time many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities changes in facts and circumstances issuance of new regulations and resolution of tax audits 

we believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 




 

item 7 a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a result of our operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure manage monitor and report risk exposures which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2017  and 2016  our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents were 16 billion and 14 billion respectively of which 293 million and 272 million respectively were denominated in pounds sterling euros or canadian 

dollars the remaining cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents are denominated in us dollars we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes a hypothetical decrease in longterm interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pretax earnings by 8 million as of december 31 2017  assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2017  we had 61 billion  in outstanding debt of which 49 billion relates to our senior notes which bear interest at fixed interest rates the remaining amount outstanding of 12 billion relates to the commercial paper program which bears interest at fluctuating rates and therefore subjects us to interest rate risk a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in longterm interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31 2017  would decrease annual pretax earnings by 12 million assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  debt” included elsewhere in this annual report 

the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper program increased from 074 as of december 31 2016 to 149 as of december 31 2017 the increase in the commercial paper program weighted average interest rate was primarily due to the decisions by the us federal reserve in march 2017 in june 2017 and in december 2017 to increase the federal funds shortterm interest rate by an aggregate 75 basis points to 150 the federal reserve also signaled that they intend to continue to increase the federal fund shortterm interest rate over the next several years and if this occurs this will continue to increase the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper program 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as an international business we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros certain assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries our exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table dollars in millions except exchange rates 

 we have a significant part of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros for the years ended december 31 2017  2016 and 2015 15 15 and 15 respectively of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros and 14 18 and 12 respectively of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes the us equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly 

we have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables that occur through our operations which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods we had foreign currency transaction losses of 4 million 1 million and 14 million for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the foreign currency transactions losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar a 10 adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2017  would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of 3 million assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity 

we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities 

we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using a current rate of exchange with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account a component of equity our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below in millions 



as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was 136 million and 345 million respectively as of december 31 2017  we had net exposure of pounds sterling canadian dollars and euros of £733 million 990 million c628 million 500 million and €103 million 124 million respectively based on these december 31 2017  net currency positions a hypothetical 10 decrease of pound sterling against us dollar would negatively impact our equity by 99 million a hypothetical 10 decrease of canadian dollar against us dollar would negatively impact our equity by 50 million and a hypothetical 10 decrease of euro against us dollar would negatively impact our equity by 12 million for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  currency exchange rate differences had a positivenegative impact of 209 million 300 million and 58 million respectively on our consolidated equity the increase for the year ended december 31 2017  is primarily due to the increase in the pound sterlingus dollar exchange rate to 13510 as of december 31 2017 from 12336 as of december 31 2016 due to the strengthening pound sterling the decrease for the year ended december 31 2016 is primarily due to the decrease in the pound sterlingus dollar exchange rate to 12336 as of december 31 2016 from 14868 as of december 31 2015 due to the weakening pound sterling the pound sterling decreased starting in june 2016 following the uk referendum that resulted in a vote for the uk to leave the eu the future impact on our business relating to the uk leaving the eu and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time including future impacts on currency exchange rates 

credit risk 

we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements 

clearing house cash deposit risks 

our clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit market and liquidity risks refer to note 13 to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this annual report for more information about clearing house cash deposits and delivery contracts which were 512 billion  as of december 31 2017  while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits as the clearing houses may pass on interest revenues minus costs to the members this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated 

credit risk 

when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits reflecting a number of factors including ratings assigned by rating agencies cds spreads and internal ratings as well as the nature and maturity of transactions we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring financial assets are placed with governments wellcapitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties 

an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties our policies require diversification of counterparties banks financial institutions bond issuers and funds to avoid a concentration of risk 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency in the right place and the right time to mitigate this risk the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets for example holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of purchased securities to decline if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity and interest rates had risen the sale of the securities might be made at a loss relative to the latest market price our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments of cash deposits for example where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities in addition the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt for example us treasury securities and supranational debt instruments euro cash deposits only with short dated maturities 

security issuer risk 

security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments 

investment counterparty risk 

investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and thus fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral under the repurchase agreement to high quality issuers when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts under clearing house control additionally the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2 of the reverse repurchase amount thus in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty’s obligation to the clearing house 

our clearing houses may use third party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided to them by the clearing house such investment advisors do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control clearing house property is held with credit worthy custodians including jpmorgan chase bank na citibank na bny mellon bmo harris na and euroclear bank brussels for nonus dollar deposits each clearing house employs or may employ multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single investment advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role additional investment advisors or custodians are available as alternatives 

crosscurrency margin deposit risk 

each of our clearing houses pursuant to their rules may permit posting of crosscurrency collateral to satisfy margin requirements for example accepting margin deposits denominated in us dollars to secure a euro margin obligation the clearing houses mitigate the risk of a decline in currency value by applying a “haircut” to the currency posted as margin at a level sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of high currency volatility crosscurrency balances are markedtomarket on a daily basis should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a sameday basis 

impact of inflation 

we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant in the event of inflation we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants as the prices that we charge are not governed by longterm contracts

our history 

our competitive strengths and competition 

competitive strengths 

we operate global markets in the asset classes in which we compete including futures cash equities equity options and otc markets we believe our key strengths include our 

 we are a leading global data provider and offer a range of data services based on data from our exchanges markets and clearing houses as well as analytics valuation reference data desktop benchmark services and connectivity services our acquisitions of superderivatives interactive data securities evaluations and credit market analysis have served to expand our data services based on rising demand for independent realtime information which is being driven by regulation market fragmentation passive investing and indexation and increased automation we provide data to global financial institutions and asset managers commercial hedgers corporates traders and consumers across virtually all asset classes we believe our data services are relevant to our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility and price levels due to the need for continuous information and analysis our data connectivity services are operated out of data centers in the us and europe 

our regulated exchanges and trading and clearing platforms offer qualified market participants access to our markets and risk management services covering a range of asset classes including interest rates equities energy agricultural metals equity index environmental currencies cds and equity options by operating several markets and offering thousands of products we provide our participants with flexibility to implement their trading and risk management strategies with common technology integrated clearing and data solutions we operate in multiple geographies and serve customers in dozens of countries as a result of products that are globally relevant 

many of our futures contracts serve as global benchmarks for managing risk relating to exposure to price movements in the underlying products including financial energy and agricultural commodities for example we operate the leading market for trading in ice brent crude oil futures as measured by the volume of contracts traded in 2016 according to the futures industry association the ice brent crude futures contract is the benchmark for pricing light sweet crude oil produced and consumed outside of the us it is part of the brent complex which forms the price reference for approximately twothirds of the world’s internationallytraded physical oil based on 2016 contract volume nearly half of the world’s crude and refined oil futures contracts were traded through ice futures europe in 2015 open interest in brent surpassed open interest in nymex wti in addition we operate a leading market for shortterm european interest rates contracts with our principal contracts based on implied forward rates on european money markets institute euribor rates and a shortterm sterling contract based on the ice libor rate we also offer markets in soft commodity benchmark contracts including sugar cocoa cotton coffee and canola which serve as global price benchmarks 

we offer a range of central clearing and related risk management services to promote the liquidity and security of our markets in jurisdictions around the world to meet local regulatory and operational needs in key financial market centers the credit and performance assurance provided by our clearing houses to clearing members is designed to substantially reduce counterparty risk and is a critical component of our exchanges’ identities as reliable and secure marketplaces for global transactions we believe the range of products cleared and the risk management services offered by our clearing houses are a competitive advantage and attract market participants our clearing houses are designed to protect the financial integrity of our markets by maintaining strong governance and rules managing collateral facilitating payments and collections enhancing capital efficiency and limiting counterparty credit risk 

we operate the leading global listings and trading exchanges for equities and etfs and offer our customers access to the us capital markets our listing venues allow companies to list domestic and international equity securities corporate structured products convertible bonds trackers and debt securities in 2016 the nyse was the global leader in capital raising for the sixth consecutive year with 120 billion raised in total ipo proceeds and followon offerings including the largest us ipo of the year 

competition 

the execution markets in which we operate are global and highly competitive we face competition in all aspects of our business from a number of different enterprises both domestic and international including traditional exchanges electronic trading platforms data vendors and voice brokers we believe we compete on the basis of a number of factors including 

• depth and liquidity of markets 

• price transparency 

• reliability and speed of trade execution and processing 

• technological capabilities and innovation 

• breadth of products and services 

• rate and quality of new product developments 

• quality of service 

• stability of services 

• distribution and ease of connectivity 

• mid and backoffice service offerings including differentiated and valueadded services 

• transaction costs and 

• reputation 

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that our deep liquid markets breadth of product offerings new product development customer relationships and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish 

us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to develop new and innovative products and services enhance our technology infrastructure maintain liquidity and offer competitive costs 

in our derivatives markets certain exchanges replicate our futures contracts for example cme group lists our futures on agricultural and energy commodities currency and equity index contracts nasdaq futures inc or nfx an energy platform operated by nasdaq has also listed certain of our energy contracts we compete in european interest rates and equity derivatives with eurex which is the derivatives exchange operated by deutsche börse nlx a uk based multilateral trading facility operated by nasdaq and curve global a consortium of banks and exchanges that lists interest rate futures in the european utilities markets we compete with eex 

 in addition to venues that offer futures products we also face competition from electronic trading systems thirdparty clearing houses and technology firms additional ventures could form or have been formed to provide services that could potentially compete with certain services that we provide 

we compete with voice brokers active in the credit derivatives markets other electronic trading platforms for derivatives clearing houses and market data vendors ice swap trade and creditex compete with other swap execution facilities and large interdealer brokers in the credit derivatives market 

we face significant competition with respect to equities trading and this competition is expected to remain intense our current and prospective competitors include regulated markets dark pools and other alternative trading systems market makers and other execution venues we also face competition from large brokers and customers that may assume the role of principal and act as counterparty to orders originating from retail customers or by matching their respective order flows through bilateral trading arrangements including through internalization of order flow 

our principal competitor for listings in the us is nasdaq omx group inc or nasdaq omx for etf listings we compete with nasdaq omx and bats we also face competition for foreign issuer listings from a number of stock exchanges outside the us including the london stock exchange deutsche börse euronext and stock exchanges in hong kong and toronto as other liquidity venues seek exchange status we may face more competition for listings 

nyse arca and nyse amex options face considerable competition in the equity options markets their principal us competitors are the chicago board options exchange inc or cboe bats and nasdaq omx 

ice data services operates in a competitive environment for all its constituent parts our exchange data products compete with similar offerings by other exchange groups that competition and the competition for order flow among the exchange groups creates a competitive pricing environment for our proprietary data products pricing and analytics competes with information obtained from informal industry relationships and sources such as broker quotes it along with the desktop and connectivity business compete with purchased thirdparty information and services from large global suppliers of financial market data such as bloomberg lp thomson reuters corporation ihsmarkit and six financial our connectivity business sfti competes with other extranet providers such as centurylink and transaction network services known as tns 

our growth strategy 

throughout our history we have expanded our core exchange clearing and data businesses both organically and through acquisitions developed innovative new products for global markets and provided services to a larger and more diverse participant base in addition we have completed a number of strategic alliances to leverage our core strengths and grow our business we seek to advance our leadership position in our markets by focusing our efforts on the following key strategies for growth 

 the record consolidated revenues and trading volume we achieved in 2016 reflect our focus on the implementation and execution of our longterm growth strategy 

expand our data offerings to address the rising demand for information 

with the growth of our ice derivatives markets and nyse equity markets we have strengthened and enhanced our data services due to demand for more data solutions this has been driven by many factors and accelerated following the financial crisis due to increased automation regulation and demand for independent realtime information to build on our exchange data and connectivity business in december 2015 we acquired interactive data which is now part of ice data services which supports our 

growth strategy by expanding the markets we serve and adding new data connectivity and valuation services as a result we currently produce daily evaluated prices for more than 27 million fixed income securities and other illiquid instruments with an array of additional analytics and related services by bringing together a wide range of data products we offer customers efficiencies in accessing data while serving the growing demand for data analysis valuation and connectivity globally by innovating new solutions to address the need for more transparency efficiency and information 

also in december 2015 we acquired trayport trayport is a software company that licenses its technology to serve brokers exchanges and traders to facilitate electronic and hybrid trade execution primarily in the energy markets this acquisition enables us to provide new technology and softwarerelated services to our energy customers the uk competition and markets authority or the cma undertook a review of our acquisition of trayport under the merger control laws of the uk during the pendency of the review we did not integrate trayport into our existing business operations for additional information regarding the trayport acquisition refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  recent developments” which is included in this annual report 

in october 2016 we acquired from sp global securities evaluations and credit market analysis which are now part of the suite of pricing and analytics products and services that comprise ice data services we will continue to look for strategic opportunities to grow our data offerings and will also continue to pursue opportunities in markets we do not currently serve but where it expands the ways in which we can serve our customers 

expand on our extensive trading clearing and risk management capabilities

 the amount of margin and guaranty fund deposits fluctuates over time as a result of among other things the extent of open positions held at any point in time by market participants and the volatility of the market as reflected in the applicable margin rates for such contracts 

clearing house risk management practices 

our clearing houses have an excellent track record of risk management and have never experienced an incident of a clearing member default which has required the use of the guaranty funds of nondefaulting clearing members or the assets of the clearing house we have extensive risk management procedures in place to ensure we protect the interests of our clearing members and clearing houses each of our clearing houses has instituted a multilayered risk management system of rules policies and procedures to protect itself in the event of a clearing member default starting with membership criteria and continuing to powers of assessment in the event of a clearing member default generally as follows 

to ensure performance our clearing houses maintain extensive technology and quantitative risk management systems as well as financial and operational requirements for clearing members and minimum margin requirements for our cleared products our clearing houses use software based on industry standard margining conventions and on our proprietary models uniquely customized to our products to determine the appropriate margin requirements for each clearing member by simulating the possible gains and losses of complex portfolios based on price movements our clearing houses’ margin methodologies are independently validated on an annual basis 

in the event of a payment default by a member the default procedures specified in the rules of that clearing house would apply in general the clearing houses would first apply assets of the defaulting member to cover the obligation these include originalinitial margin variation margin positions held at the clearing house and guaranty fund deposits of the clearing member in addition the clearing houses could make a demand for payment pursuant to any available guarantee provided by the parent or affiliate of the defaulting clearing member if that is not sufficient the clearing houses would use any designated contributions held by the clearing house itself as applicable the guaranty fund contributions of other members and funds collected through an assessment against all other nondefaulting members to satisfy the remaining deficit if any as part of the powers and procedures designed to backstop financial obligations in the event of a default each of our clearing houses may levy assessments on all of its clearing members if there are insufficient funds available to cover a deficit following the depletion of all assets in the guaranty fund

our clearing houses require that each clearing member make deposits to the guaranty fund the amounts in the guaranty fund serve to secure the obligations of a clearing member to our clearing houses and may be used to cover losses in excess of the margin and clearing firm accounts sustained by our clearing houses in the event of a default of a clearing member as of december 31 2016  we have made combined contributions to our clearing houses guaranty funds of 253 million  ice clear europe has contributed 100 million  of its own cash as part of its futures and options guaranty fund as of december 31 2016  and has also contributed 50 million  of its own cash as part of its cds guaranty fund as of december 31 2016  ice clear credit has contributed 50 million  of its own cash as part of its cds guaranty fund as of december 31 2016  and ice clear us has contributed 50 million  of its own cash as part of its futures and options guaranty fund as of december 31 2016  ice clear canada ice clear netherlands and ice clear singapore have each also contributed a combined 3 million in cash to their respective guaranty funds each of these amounts are reflected as longterm restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet

item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect us in the future if any of the risks discussed below actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected accordingly you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this annual report 

global economic political financial market and social events or conditions may impact volatility that may negatively impact our business 

global economic conditions will impact our business adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment currency fluctuations actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending if our customers reduce spending workforce trading activity or demand for financial data as a result of challenges in the prevailing economic markets our revenues will decline further nyse’s revenue increases when more companies are willing to go public and stagnation or a decline in the initial public offering market would have an adverse effect on our revenues a prolonged decrease in the number of initial public offerings could also negatively impact the growth of our transaction revenues since initial public offerings are typically actively traded following the offering date 

a significant portion of our revenues are derived from fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets we derived 43 56 and 61 of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses from our transactionbased business in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively in particular we derive a significant percentage of the consolidated revenues from our transactionbased business from trading in ice brent crude futures and options contracts north american natural gas futures and options contracts sugar futures and options contracts equity transactions and short term interest rates contracts including the euribor and short sterling futures and options contracts the trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of trading activity for any reason including the factors referenced above that impact volatility and 

 a reduction in our overall trading volume could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenues a reduction in trading volumes could also result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for our market data which would further reduce our overall revenue 

in addition recent economic weakness and uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted or may result in decreased revenues or growth rates for example the uk’s june 2016 vote to leave the european union commonly known as “brexit” and the uncertainty surrounding the uk’s exit from the european union could negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions that could continue for the foreseeable future such economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products and services 

our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to increased legislation and regulatory scrutiny and we face the risk of changes to this regulatory environment and business in the future 

we are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in many jurisdictions around the world and in particular in the us and the uk where the largest portions of our operations are conducted we face the risk of significant actions by regulatory and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments that may affect our business the activity of our market participants and as a consequence our results among other things as a result of regulators and tax authorities enforcing existing laws and regulations we could be censured fined prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities including fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory pricing restrictions known as frand or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees including settlement payments interest payments and penalty payments in many cases our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions 

there is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could be imposed this could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients’ overall trading volume through our exchanges and demand for our market data and other services in addition regulation imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally such as enhanced regulatory capital requirements could adversely impact levels of market activity and price volatility more broadly and thus impact our businesses notwithstanding the recent us presidential election it is unknown at this time to what extent new legislation will be passed into law or pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted or modified or the effect that such passage adoption or modification will have positively or negatively on our industry or on us 

these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our stockholders and creditors in addition certain developments could increase our liability for performing our oversight requirements 

us and european legal and regulatory developments in response to the global financial crisis in particular the doddfrank act emir mifid ii and the benchmark regulation have significantly altered and propose to further alter the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability among the aspects of these enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes most likely to affect our businesses are position limit rules in the us and europe nondiscriminatory access provisions of mifid ii interoperability and margin rules in emir enhanced regulatory capital liquidity and leverage rules in basel iii and capital requirements directive iv access rules under the benchmark regulation the nonharmonization of margin requirements implementation of a financial transaction tax access to our benchmarks and maintaining our exchanges’ abilities to operate as sros with related immunity for the discharge of their regulatory functions as the operator of global businesses the lack of harmonization in international financial reform efforts could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in multiple jurisdictions 

the doddfrank act established enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the fsoc ice clear credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the fsoc and as a result is subject to additional oversight by the cftc 

other enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations 

systems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry could negatively impact us 

highprofile system failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry like the one we suffered at nyse on july 8 2015 could negatively impact our business and result in regulatory investigations fines and penalties further regulators have imposed new requirements for trading platforms that have been costly for us to implement or that could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services in particular the sec’s regulation systems compliance and integrity or regulation sci and the cftcs system safeguards regulations subject portions of our securities and derivatives trading platforms and other technological systems related to our clearing houses trade repositories and the us swap execution facility or sef to more extensive regulation and oversight ensuring our compliance with the requirements of regulation sci and the cftcs system safeguards regulations requires significant implementation costs as well as increased ongoing administrative expenses and burdens if system failures in the industry continue to occur it is also possible that investor confidence in the trading industry could diminish leading to decreased trading volume and revenue whether or not any of our own systems experience material failures any of these developments could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

our business is subject to the impact of financial markets volatility including the prices and interest rates underlying our derivative products due to conditions that are beyond our control 

trading volume in our markets and products is largely driven by the degree of volatility  the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations  in prices and levels of the underlying commodities securities indices financial benchmarks or other instruments volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates opportunities for investment and speculative or arbitrage trading were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices or levels of the underlying commodities securities indices benchmarks or other instruments of our products we could experience lower trading volumes slower growth or declines in revenues 

factors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility and thus trading volumes include 



any one or more of these factors which are beyond our control may reduce trading activity which could make our markets less attractive as a source of liquidity and in turn could further discourage existing and potential market participants and thus accelerate a decline in the level of trading activity and potentially related services such as data or clearing if any of these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets could be jeopardized because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our current products and services decline for any reason we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues which would cause our net income to decline 

owning clearing houses exposes us to risks including risk related to defaults by clearing members risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses 

there are risks inherent in operating a clearing house including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members market liquidity risks defaults by clearing members and risks associated with investing margin or guaranty fund assets provided by clearing members to our clearing houses which could subject our business to substantial losses for example clearing members have transferred an aggregate amount of cash in ice clear europe relating to margin and guaranty funds of 295 billion as of december 31 2016 and a total of 552 billion for all of our clearing houses as of december 31 2016 ice clear europe and ice clear us use third party investment managers for investment of cash assets and may add or change the investment managers from time to time to the extent available ice clear credit holds the us dollar cash that clearing members transfer to satisfy their original margin and guaranty fund requirements at its account at the federal reserve with respect to other clearing member cash posted ice clear credit currently selfmanages the majority of such cash and ice clear credit uses external investment managers to invest the remainder of such cash margin and guaranty fund deposits 

we have an obligation to return margin payments and guaranty fund contributions to clearing members to the extent that the relevant member’s risk based on its open contracts to the clearing house is reduced if a number of clearing members substantially reduce their open interest or default the concentration of risks within our clearing houses will be spread among a smaller pool of clearing members which would make it more difficult to absorb and manage risk in the event of a further clearing member’s default 

although our clearing houses have policies and procedures to help ensure that clearing members can satisfy their obligations such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a member or a counterparty’s default in addition although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards it is a complex process and there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect us from the risks of clearing these products we cannot assure you that these measures and safeguards will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default we have contributed a limited amount of our own capital to the guaranty fund of the clearing houses that could be used in the event of a default furthermore the default of any one of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and cause our customers to lose confidence in the guarantee of our clearing houses 

a decline in the value of securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions by our clearing houses or default by a sovereign government issuer could pose additional risks of default by clearing members 

our clearing houses hold a substantial amount of assets as margin or guaranty fund contributions which comprise us and other sovereign treasury securities as of december 31 2016 our clearing houses held 401 billion of noncash margin or guaranty fund contributions in us and other sovereign treasury securities 290 billion of this amount was comprised of us treasury securities 20 billion of french treasury securities 17 billion of german treasury securities 11 billion of uk treasury securities 933 million of italian treasury securities and 54 billion of other european japanese and triparty treasury securities sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest and most liquid securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived credit worthiness of major governments although the markets for such securities have experienced significant volatility during the past decade and as of late due to ongoing financial challenges in some of the major european countries and leading up to the us government’s negotiations regarding taxation spending cuts and raising the debt ceiling which is the maximum amount of debt that the us government can legally incur in addition if there is a collapse of the euro our clearing houses would face significant expenses in changing their systems and such an event could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates to mitigate this risk our clearing houses currently apply a discount or “haircut” to the market values for all sovereign securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions however market conditions could change more quickly than we adjust the amount of the haircuts and the haircuts could be insufficient in the event of a sudden market event 

notwithstanding the current intraday margin and valuation checks conducted by our clearing houses and our policies and practices to limit exposures our clearing houses will need to continue to monitor the volatility and value of sovereign treasury securities if the value of these securities declines significantly our clearing houses will need to collect additional margin or 

guaranty fund contributions from their clearing members which may be difficult for the members to supply in a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government in addition our clearing houses may be required to impose a more significant discount on the value of sovereign treasury securities posted as margin or guaranty fund contributions if there is uncertainty regarding the future value of these securities which would trigger the need for additional margin or guaranty fund contributions by the clearing members if a clearing member cannot supply the additional margin or guaranty fund contributions which may include cash in a currency acceptable to the clearing house the clearing house would deem the clearing member in default if any clearing members default as a result of the reduction in our valuation of margin or guaranty fund contributions our clearing houses and trading business could suffer substantial losses as a result of the loss of any capital that has been contributed to the clearing house’s guaranty funds and a loss of confidence by clearing members in the clearing house resulting in a reduction in volumes of future cleared transactions 

further our clearing houses invest large sums through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and may hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions our clearing houses may also make time deposits with banks that are secured only to the value of fdic insurance or other national deposit guarantee schemes which is small and therefore our deposits may in significant part be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent 

owning and operating equity exchanges exposes us to additional risks including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject 

owning and operating equity exchanges for which the revenues are primarily derived from market data listing fees and trading activity exposes us to additional risks adverse economic conditions and regulatory changes similar to those discussed above could result in decreased trading volume discourage market participants from listing on our equity exchanges or cause them to forgo new offerings any of these could reduce our revenues including market data revenue 

our exchanges are operated as forprofit businesses but have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled specifically our exchanges are responsible for enforcing listed company compliance with applicable listing standards overseeing regulatory policy determinations rule interpretation and regulationrelated rule development and conducting trading reviews any failure by one of our exchanges with selfregulatory responsibility to comply with and enforce compliance by their members with exchange rules and securities laws could significantly harm our reputation prompt regulatory scrutiny result in the payment of fines or penalties and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we must allocate significant resources to fulfill our selfregulatory responsibilities the forprofit exchanges’ goal of maximizing stockholder value might contradict the exchanges’ selfregulatory responsibilities the listing of our common stock on the nyse could potentially create a conflict between the exchange’s regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities on the one hand and our commercial and economic interest on the other hand while we have structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful 

further changes in the rules and operations of our securities markets must be reviewed and approved by the sec approval of such changes by the sec cannot be guaranteed and the sec could delay either the approval process or the initiation of the public comment process any denial or delay in approving changes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our compliance and risk management methods as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations might not be effective which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators 

our ability to comply with complex and changing laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel while we have policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks and regulatory obligations we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed regulators periodically review our exchanges’ ability to selfregulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including selfregulatory standards in particular certain of our businesses acquired in the nyse acquisition are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations policies and procedures if we fail to comply with any of these obligations regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business 

our acquisitions expose us to new regulatory requirements for example as a result of our acquisitions of interactive data and securities evaluations we now operate two sec registered investment advisers called interactive data pricing and reference data llc or prd llc and securities evaluations with respect to their provision of evaluated pricing services investment advisers are subject to significant regulatory obligations under the investment advisers act of 1940 or investment advisers act 

prior to these acquisitions none of our businesses were registered under the investment advisers act compliance with the investment advisers act and other regulatory requirements gives rise to costs and expenses that may be material 

our regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses for example we paid a 5 million penalty to the sec in 2014 and a 3 million penalty to the cftc in 2015 as a result of enforcement actions brought by these regulators in december 2015 nyse received an inquiry from the enforcement staff of the sec regarding a july 8 2015 outage on the nyse markets during which trading was suspended for approximately 35 hours in all symbols the investigation proceeded throughout 2016 and on december 29 2016 nyse received a wells notice stating that the staff have made a preliminary determination to recommend that the sec file an enforcement action in connection with how nyse responded on july 8 2015 to the circumstances leading into the suspension of trading that day the results of the wells notice and any enforcement action related to the july 8 2015 outage are unknown at this time 

in addition we have several other ongoing investigations and inquiries from the sec and other regulators that could lead to additional wells notices or enforcement actions we will continue to face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations financial condition or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business further any settlement consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or regulatory agencies begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities finally the implementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to remain competitive and grow our business 

we face intense competition 

we face intense competition in all aspects of our business and our competitors both domestic and international are numerous we currently compete with 

 trends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings finally many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and alternative trading system businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business 

we also face pricing competition in many areas of our business a decline in our fees due to competitive pressure the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for example interactive data’s business has benefited from a high renewal rate in its subscription based business but we cannot assure you that this will continue we also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers if we are not able to compete successfully our business could be materially impacted including our ability to sustain as an operating entity 

in our listings business the legal and regulatory environment in the us and the market perceptions about that environment may make it difficult for our us equity exchanges to compete with nonus equity exchanges for listings for example negative perceptions regarding compliance costs associated with adherence to corporate governance requirements have and may continue to discourage listings on us equity exchanges by both us and foreign private issuers any failure by our exchanges to successfully compete for any reason could adversely impact our revenue derived from listing fees and the associated trading execution and market data fees 

we may have difficulty maintaining our growth effectively 

we have achieved a tremendous amount of growth since becoming a public company in 2005 our growth is highly dependent on customer demand for our core products and services favorable economic conditions and our ability to invest in our personnel facilities infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls adverse economic conditions could reduce customer demand for our products and services which may place a significant strain on our management and resources and could force us to defer existing or future planned opportunities in addition we may not be successful in executing on our strategies to support our growth organically or as described above through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances 

we may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities 

we intend to launch new products and continue to explore and pursue other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may spend substantial time and money developing new product offerings or improving current product offerings if these offerings are not successful we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to recover the costs of such initiatives obtaining any required regulatory approval associated with these offerings may also result in delays or restrictions on our ability to fully benefit from these offerings further we may enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry attracting customers in certain countries may also be subject to a number of risks including currency exchange rate risk difficulties in enforcing agreements or collecting receivables longer payment cycles compliance with the laws or regulations of these countries and political and regulatory uncertainties 

in addition in light of consolidation in the exchange data services and clearing sectors and competition for opportunities we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully our competitors could merge making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors also offering new products and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives that are necessary for our success 

we have made substantial progress toward developing and deploying new technology platforms to improve our equity exchange business and data services business we may experience disruptions or encounter unexpected challenges in deploying these new systems further the costs to complete the remaining work may exceed our current expectations any significant cost increases or disruptions to product quality sales effectiveness or client service or to our other business operations could have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations 

we may fail to complete or realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our recent acquisitions and future acquisitions which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we have completed many acquisitions and plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures when we deem it appropriate the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to integrate these businesses into our existing operations and realize anticipated cost savings revenue synergies and growth opportunities we generally set aggressive timelines for realizing savings   which assumes we successfully undertake a variety of actions including but not limited to integrating technology eliminating redundancies and effecting organizational restructurings that are themselves subject to a variety of risks and may be subject to regulatory approvals that we do not control the process of integrating acquired companies is time consuming and could disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties including inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants regulators and others require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of the business 

there is a risk however that we may not integrate these acquired companies in a manner that permits our expected cost savings and revenue synergies to be fully realized in the time periods expected or at all in addition a variety of factors including but not limited to regulatory conditions governmental competition approvals currency fluctuations and difficulty integrating 

technology platforms may adversely affect our ability to complete our acquisitions or realize our anticipated cost savings and synergies for example the cma in the uk has ordered a divestment of trayport and we are currently in the process of appealing their decision if our appeal is successful the matter will be sent back to the cma for additional review and if we are not successful we will be forced to sell trayport if a sale is required there is no certainty of the price we could receive and we may also suffer a loss due to currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the pound sterling as of december 31 2016 the accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation for trayport was 117 million due to the decrease in the pound sterling which is trayport’s functional currency compared to the us dollar since the acquisition date if we are required to sell trayport we would include the accumulated translation adjustment when computing the gain or loss from the sale 

we may also not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures or alliances that we have entered into or may enter into for a number of reasons including regulatory or government approvals or changes global market changes contractual obligations competing products and in some instances our lack of or limited control over the management of the business further strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future 

we continue to look for strategic growth opportunities in line with our business strategy and will pursue acquisitions when we believe that they are in our best interests we may be very acquisitive as a result of any future acquisition we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest expend cash incur debt assume actual and contingent liabilities inherit existing or pending litigation or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets further we cannot assure you that any such financing or equity investments will be available with terms that will be favorable to us or available at all 

if we are unable to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences we may not be able to compete effectively 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary and acquired technology the financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change change in use patterns change in client preferences frequent product and service introductions and the emergence of new industry standards and practices these changes could render our existing proprietary technology uncompetitive or obsolete 

further we use some opensource software in our technology most often as small components within a larger product or service to augment algorithms functionalities or libraries we create and we may use more opensource software in the future opensource code is also contained in some thirdparty software we rely on we could be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of the license for such opensource software the terms of many opensource licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us or other courts and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology to our clients’ requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and costeffective manner any failure to remain abreast of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to client preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our revenues 

our business may be harmed by computer and communications systems failures and delays 

our business depends on the integrity reliability and security of our computer and communication systems we support and maintain many of the systems that comprise our electronic platforms and our failure to monitor or maintain these systems or to find replacements for defective components within a system in a timely and costeffective manner when necessary could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business our customers rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate and highquality financial market data analytics and related solutions our timely reliable delivery of highquality products and services is subject to an array of technical production processes that enable our delivery platforms to leverage an extensive range of content databases our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 



 we could experience system failures due to power or telecommunications failures human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyberattacks intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar events if any one or more of these situations were to arise they could result in damage to our business reputation and participant dissatisfaction with our electronic platform which could prompt participants to trade elsewhere or expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions as a consequence our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

our regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in volume of order and trading transaction traffic and to provide processing and clearing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

our systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks hacking and cyberattacks especially in light of our role in the global financial marketplace which could result in wrongful use of our information or which could make our participants reluctant to use our electronic platform 

the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to reliably transact on our electronic platforms and provide financial data services are critical elements of our operations some of our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential client data including client portfolio information if anyone gains improper access to our electronic platforms networks or databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify our confidential information or that of a third party our networks and those of our participants third party service providers and external market infrastructures may be vulnerable to compromise security technology failure social engineering denial of service attacks or other security failures resulting in loss of data integrity information disclosure unavailability or fraud recently the financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of political protest activism and fraud further former employees of certain companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly 

although we have not been the victim of cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cyber security events including distributed denial of service attacks malware infections phishing web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size for example we experienced a distributed denial of service attack against our website in november 2016 that activated automated mitigation response and was reportable to regulatory authorities we operate an information security program that is designed to prevent detect track and mitigate cyber incidents and that has detected and mitigated such incidents in the past although we intend to continually implement new industry standard security measures as they develop in the future to maintain the effectiveness of our information security program we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against attacks losses or reduced trading volume in our markets as a result of any security breach hacking or cyberattack any such attacks could result in reputational damage cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose customers cause us to experience lower current and future trading volumes or incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive position additionally current and future security measures may involve significant costs to purchase and maintain which could adversely impact our net income 

we currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness 

following our acquisition of nyse and interactive data we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis as of december 31 2016 we had 64 billion of outstanding debt this level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities as we use our available resources to reduce and refinance our consolidated debt our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue future business opportunities may be further restrained in addition the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio test and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other matters 

our longterm debt is currently rated by moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s these ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time and it is possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade our credit ratings in the future in particular our inability to sustain reduced debt on a consolidated basis may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings a significant downgrade of our credit rating could impact the regulatory status of our clearing houses make parties less willing to do business with us and could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase the cost of any future debt funding we may obtain 

damage to our reputation resulting from our administration of libor or other benchmarks could adversely affect our business 

our subsidiary iba is the administrator for various benchmarks including libor iba’s administration of libor is the result of the libor scandal which was a series of fraudulent actions taken by banks that were submitting false libor rates to profit from trades or to give the impression that the banks were more creditworthy than they were any failures or negative publicity resulting from our administration of libor or other benchmarks could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and could harm our reputation 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

since we conduct operations in several different countries including the us uk continental europe and canada substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling euros and canadian dollars because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

the european debt crisis and related european financial restructuring efforts have contributed to instability in global credit markets and resulted in a decline in the value of the pounds sterling and euro relative to the us dollar in addition brexit and the outcome of the us presidential election each have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially among the us dollar the british pound sterling and the euro if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the uk continental europe the us or other key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further the value of the pound sterling and euro and the global credit markets may further weaken general financial instability in countries in the european union including greece could have a contagion effect on the region and contribute to the general instability and uncertainty in the european union events that adversely affect our uk and continental european clients and suppliers could in turn have a materially adverse effect on our international business results and our results of operations

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill other intangible assets or investments 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2016 we had goodwill of 123 billion and net other intangible assets of 104 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties we recorded a 33 million impairment loss on our creditex customer relationship intangible asset during 2016 primarily due to the sale of our creditex us voice broker operations and the discontinuance of our creditex uk voice brokerage 

operations in 2016 as of december 31 2016 we have 432 million in longterm investments relating to our equity security investment in cetip sa or cetip we recorded a 190 million impairment loss on our investment in cetip during 2013 primarily due to the devaluation of the brazilian real as of december 31 2016 our investment in cetip included an accumulated unrealized gain of 108 million 

we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may result in asset impairments an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill other intangible assets and other investments and assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 

for additional information on our goodwill other intangible assets and investments including impairment refer to notes 5 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements and “ critical accounting policies  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets” in item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which are included in this annual report 

we may face liability for content contained in our data products and services 

we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation libel copyright or trademark infringement fraud or negligence or based on other theories of liability in each case relating to the data articles commentary ratings information or other content we distribute in our financial data services if such data or other content or information that we distribute has errors is delayed or has design defects we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our corporate website or those websites that we own and operate through links to other websites use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for significant amounts any such claim even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us could involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations and a negative impact on our reputation in addition we license and redistribute data and content from various third parties and the terms of these licenses change frequently our data and content suppliers may audit our use and our clients’ use and payment for data and content and may assert that we or our clients owe additional amounts under the terms of the license agreements that we inappropriately distributed the third partys data or that we or our clients used the data or content in a manner that exceeded the scope of the license agreement we may incur costs to investigate any such allegations and may be required to make unexpected payments to these data and content suppliers and these costs and payments could be material 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties including trademarks service marks trade names trade secrets copyrights and patents we cannot assure you that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property additionally we may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively further we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights which may require significant financial and managerial resources as a result we may choose not to enforce our infringed intellectual property rights depending on our strategic evaluation and judgment regarding the best use of our resources the relative strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the recourse available to us 

in addition our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may have obtained and may be expected to obtain in the future patent rights related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services as a result we may face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the holders of the patents or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patents we also could be required to pay damages if we were found to infringe patents held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we rely on third party providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of an important service data or content supplied by any third party or the loss of an exclusive license could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as online service providers hosting service and software providers data processors software and hardware vendors banks local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading clearing data services and other systems we rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with third parties and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for the provision of hosting services we also depend on thirdparty suppliers for data and content including data received from certain competitors clients various government and public record services and financial institutions used in our products and services some of this data is exclusive to particular suppliers and may not be obtained from other suppliers in addition our data suppliers could enter into exclusive contracts with our competitors without our knowledge the general trend toward industry consolidation may increase the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future if these companies were to discontinue providing services to us for any reason or fail to provide the type of service agreed to we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients or increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines our third party data suppliers perform audits on us from time to time in the ordinary course of business to determine if data we license for redistribution has been properly accounted for in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreement as a result of these audits we may incur additional expenses 

many of our clients also rely on third parties to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform if these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients’ inability to transact with our businesses we hold exclusive licenses to list various index futures and contracts in the future litigation or regulatory action may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and contracts trading to a single exchange and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license mifid ii introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of services relating to commodity derivatives across europe and the legislation requires open access to any benchmarks a benchmark is an index or other measure used to determine the value of a financial instrument for example libor or the sp 500 used in europe if unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive license were permitted we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products 

we are subject to significant litigation and liability risks 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our participants involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred for example dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platform or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades abusive trading practices security and confidentiality breaches mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants in addition because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by entering them inaccurately a large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets in addition we are subject to various legal disputes some of which we are involved in due to acquisition activity we could incur significant expenses defending claims even those without merit which could adversely affect our financing condition and operating results an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for a summary of our legal proceedings and claims 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

given our prominence in the global securities industry and the location of many of our properties and personnel in us and european financial centers including lower manhattan we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to 

attract and retain employees in addition terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets including trading on exchanges any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

owning and operating voice broker businesses exposes us to additional risk and these businesses are largely dependent on their brokerdealer clients 

our voice broker business is primarily transactionbased and it provides brokerage services to clients primarily in the form of agency transactions although it also engages in a limited number of matched principal transactions in agency transactions customers pay transaction fees for trade execution services in which we connect buyers and sellers who settle their transactions directly in matched principal transactions also known as “riskless principal” transactions we agree to buy instruments from one customer and sell them to another customer the amount of the fee generally depends on the spread between the buy and sell price of the security that is brokered with respect to matched principal transactions a counterparty to a matched principal transaction may fail to fulfill its obligations or we may face liability for an unmatched trade we also face the risk of not being able to collect transaction or processing fees charged to customers for brokerage services and processing services we provide 

we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt is dividends from our subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results further we have guaranteed the payment of certain obligations by our subsidiary nyse holdings llc this guarantee may require us to provide substantial funds or assets to creditors of our subsidiaries at a time when we are in need of liquidity to fund our own obligations and may affect our ability to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock 

provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ice 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for ice these provisions make a change of control less likely which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of us and european equity exchanges for example our organizational documents include provisions that generally restrict any person either alone or together with its related persons from i voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10 of our outstanding voting capital stock including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock or ii beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock further our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to call special stockholders’ meetings or act by written consent and generally authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock in addition provisions of delaware law may have a similar effect such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders as defined under delaware law from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the board of directors

item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect us in the future if any of the risks discussed below actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected accordingly you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this annual report 

global economic political financial market and social events or conditions may impact volatility that may negatively impact our business 

global economic conditions will impact our business adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment currency fluctuations actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending if our customers reduce spending workforce trading activity or demand for financial data as a result of challenges in the prevailing economic markets our revenues will decline further nyse’s revenue increases when more companies are willing to go public and stagnation or a decline in the initial public offering market would have an adverse effect on our revenues a prolonged decrease in the number of initial public offerings could also negatively impact the growth of our transaction revenues since initial public offerings are typically actively traded following the offering date 

a significant portion of our revenues are derived from fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets we derived 43 56 and 61 of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses from our transactionbased business in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively in particular we derive a significant percentage of the consolidated revenues from our transactionbased business from trading in ice brent crude futures and options contracts north american natural gas futures and options contracts sugar futures and options contracts equity transactions and short term interest rates contracts including the euribor and short sterling futures and options contracts the trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of trading activity for any reason including the factors referenced above that impact volatility and 

 a reduction in our overall trading volume could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenues a reduction in trading volumes could also result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for our market data which would further reduce our overall revenue 

in addition recent economic weakness and uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted or may result in decreased revenues or growth rates for example the uk’s june 2016 vote to leave the european union commonly known as “brexit” and the uncertainty surrounding the uk’s exit from the european union could negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions that could continue for the foreseeable future such economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products and services 

our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to increased legislation and regulatory scrutiny and we face the risk of changes to this regulatory environment and business in the future 

we are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in many jurisdictions around the world and in particular in the us and the uk where the largest portions of our operations are conducted we face the risk of significant actions by regulatory and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments that may affect our business the activity of our market participants and as a consequence our results among other things as a result of regulators and tax authorities enforcing existing laws and regulations we could be censured fined prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities including fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory pricing restrictions known as frand or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees including settlement payments interest payments and penalty payments in many cases our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions 

there is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could be imposed this could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients’ overall trading volume through our exchanges and demand for our market data and other services in addition regulation imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally such as enhanced regulatory capital requirements could adversely impact levels of market activity and price volatility more broadly and thus impact our businesses notwithstanding the recent us presidential election it is unknown at this time to what extent new legislation will be passed into law or pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted or modified or the effect that such passage adoption or modification will have positively or negatively on our industry or on us 

these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our stockholders and creditors in addition certain developments could increase our liability for performing our oversight requirements 

us and european legal and regulatory developments in response to the global financial crisis in particular the doddfrank act emir mifid ii and the benchmark regulation have significantly altered and propose to further alter the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability among the aspects of these enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes most likely to affect our businesses are position limit rules in the us and europe nondiscriminatory access provisions of mifid ii interoperability and margin rules in emir enhanced regulatory capital liquidity and leverage rules in basel iii and capital requirements directive iv access rules under the benchmark regulation the nonharmonization of margin requirements implementation of a financial transaction tax access to our benchmarks and maintaining our exchanges’ abilities to operate as sros with related immunity for the discharge of their regulatory functions as the operator of global businesses the lack of harmonization in international financial reform efforts could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in multiple jurisdictions 

the doddfrank act established enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the fsoc ice clear credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the fsoc and as a result is subject to additional oversight by the cftc 

other enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability see item 1 “ business  regulation” above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations 

systems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry could negatively impact us 

highprofile system failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry like the one we suffered at nyse on july 8 2015 could negatively impact our business and result in regulatory investigations fines and penalties further regulators have imposed new requirements for trading platforms that have been costly for us to implement or that could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services in particular the sec’s regulation systems compliance and integrity or regulation sci and the cftcs system safeguards regulations subject portions of our securities and derivatives trading platforms and other technological systems related to our clearing houses trade repositories and the us swap execution facility or sef to more extensive regulation and oversight ensuring our compliance with the requirements of regulation sci and the cftcs system safeguards regulations requires significant implementation costs as well as increased ongoing administrative expenses and burdens if system failures in the industry continue to occur it is also possible that investor confidence in the trading industry could diminish leading to decreased trading volume and revenue whether or not any of our own systems experience material failures any of these developments could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

our business is subject to the impact of financial markets volatility including the prices and interest rates underlying our derivative products due to conditions that are beyond our control 

trading volume in our markets and products is largely driven by the degree of volatility  the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations  in prices and levels of the underlying commodities securities indices financial benchmarks or other instruments volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates opportunities for investment and speculative or arbitrage trading were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices or levels of the underlying commodities securities indices benchmarks or other instruments of our products we could experience lower trading volumes slower growth or declines in revenues 

factors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility and thus trading volumes include 



any one or more of these factors which are beyond our control may reduce trading activity which could make our markets less attractive as a source of liquidity and in turn could further discourage existing and potential market participants and thus accelerate a decline in the level of trading activity and potentially related services such as data or clearing if any of these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets could be jeopardized because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our current products and services decline for any reason we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues which would cause our net income to decline 

owning clearing houses exposes us to risks including risk related to defaults by clearing members risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses 

there are risks inherent in operating a clearing house including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members market liquidity risks defaults by clearing members and risks associated with investing margin or guaranty fund assets provided by clearing members to our clearing houses which could subject our business to substantial losses for example clearing members have transferred an aggregate amount of cash in ice clear europe relating to margin and guaranty funds of 295 billion as of december 31 2016 and a total of 552 billion for all of our clearing houses as of december 31 2016 ice clear europe and ice clear us use third party investment managers for investment of cash assets and may add or change the investment managers from time to time to the extent available ice clear credit holds the us dollar cash that clearing members transfer to satisfy their original margin and guaranty fund requirements at its account at the federal reserve with respect to other clearing member cash posted ice clear credit currently selfmanages the majority of such cash and ice clear credit uses external investment managers to invest the remainder of such cash margin and guaranty fund deposits 

we have an obligation to return margin payments and guaranty fund contributions to clearing members to the extent that the relevant member’s risk based on its open contracts to the clearing house is reduced if a number of clearing members substantially reduce their open interest or default the concentration of risks within our clearing houses will be spread among a smaller pool of clearing members which would make it more difficult to absorb and manage risk in the event of a further clearing member’s default 

although our clearing houses have policies and procedures to help ensure that clearing members can satisfy their obligations such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a member or a counterparty’s default in addition although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards it is a complex process and there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect us from the risks of clearing these products we cannot assure you that these measures and safeguards will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default we have contributed a limited amount of our own capital to the guaranty fund of the clearing houses that could be used in the event of a default furthermore the default of any one of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and cause our customers to lose confidence in the guarantee of our clearing houses 

a decline in the value of securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions by our clearing houses or default by a sovereign government issuer could pose additional risks of default by clearing members 

our clearing houses hold a substantial amount of assets as margin or guaranty fund contributions which comprise us and other sovereign treasury securities as of december 31 2016 our clearing houses held 401 billion of noncash margin or guaranty fund contributions in us and other sovereign treasury securities 290 billion of this amount was comprised of us treasury securities 20 billion of french treasury securities 17 billion of german treasury securities 11 billion of uk treasury securities 933 million of italian treasury securities and 54 billion of other european japanese and triparty treasury securities sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest and most liquid securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived credit worthiness of major governments although the markets for such securities have experienced significant volatility during the past decade and as of late due to ongoing financial challenges in some of the major european countries and leading up to the us government’s negotiations regarding taxation spending cuts and raising the debt ceiling which is the maximum amount of debt that the us government can legally incur in addition if there is a collapse of the euro our clearing houses would face significant expenses in changing their systems and such an event could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates to mitigate this risk our clearing houses currently apply a discount or “haircut” to the market values for all sovereign securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions however market conditions could change more quickly than we adjust the amount of the haircuts and the haircuts could be insufficient in the event of a sudden market event 

notwithstanding the current intraday margin and valuation checks conducted by our clearing houses and our policies and practices to limit exposures our clearing houses will need to continue to monitor the volatility and value of sovereign treasury securities if the value of these securities declines significantly our clearing houses will need to collect additional margin or 

guaranty fund contributions from their clearing members which may be difficult for the members to supply in a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government in addition our clearing houses may be required to impose a more significant discount on the value of sovereign treasury securities posted as margin or guaranty fund contributions if there is uncertainty regarding the future value of these securities which would trigger the need for additional margin or guaranty fund contributions by the clearing members if a clearing member cannot supply the additional margin or guaranty fund contributions which may include cash in a currency acceptable to the clearing house the clearing house would deem the clearing member in default if any clearing members default as a result of the reduction in our valuation of margin or guaranty fund contributions our clearing houses and trading business could suffer substantial losses as a result of the loss of any capital that has been contributed to the clearing house’s guaranty funds and a loss of confidence by clearing members in the clearing house resulting in a reduction in volumes of future cleared transactions 

further our clearing houses invest large sums through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and may hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions our clearing houses may also make time deposits with banks that are secured only to the value of fdic insurance or other national deposit guarantee schemes which is small and therefore our deposits may in significant part be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent 

owning and operating equity exchanges exposes us to additional risks including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject 

owning and operating equity exchanges for which the revenues are primarily derived from market data listing fees and trading activity exposes us to additional risks adverse economic conditions and regulatory changes similar to those discussed above could result in decreased trading volume discourage market participants from listing on our equity exchanges or cause them to forgo new offerings any of these could reduce our revenues including market data revenue 

our exchanges are operated as forprofit businesses but have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled specifically our exchanges are responsible for enforcing listed company compliance with applicable listing standards overseeing regulatory policy determinations rule interpretation and regulationrelated rule development and conducting trading reviews any failure by one of our exchanges with selfregulatory responsibility to comply with and enforce compliance by their members with exchange rules and securities laws could significantly harm our reputation prompt regulatory scrutiny result in the payment of fines or penalties and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we must allocate significant resources to fulfill our selfregulatory responsibilities the forprofit exchanges’ goal of maximizing stockholder value might contradict the exchanges’ selfregulatory responsibilities the listing of our common stock on the nyse could potentially create a conflict between the exchange’s regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities on the one hand and our commercial and economic interest on the other hand while we have structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful 

further changes in the rules and operations of our securities markets must be reviewed and approved by the sec approval of such changes by the sec cannot be guaranteed and the sec could delay either the approval process or the initiation of the public comment process any denial or delay in approving changes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our compliance and risk management methods as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations might not be effective which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators 

our ability to comply with complex and changing laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel while we have policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks and regulatory obligations we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed regulators periodically review our exchanges’ ability to selfregulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including selfregulatory standards in particular certain of our businesses acquired in the nyse acquisition are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations policies and procedures if we fail to comply with any of these obligations regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business 

our acquisitions expose us to new regulatory requirements for example as a result of our acquisitions of interactive data and securities evaluations we now operate two sec registered investment advisers called interactive data pricing and reference data llc or prd llc and securities evaluations with respect to their provision of evaluated pricing services investment advisers are subject to significant regulatory obligations under the investment advisers act of 1940 or investment advisers act 

prior to these acquisitions none of our businesses were registered under the investment advisers act compliance with the investment advisers act and other regulatory requirements gives rise to costs and expenses that may be material 

our regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses for example we paid a 5 million penalty to the sec in 2014 and a 3 million penalty to the cftc in 2015 as a result of enforcement actions brought by these regulators in december 2015 nyse received an inquiry from the enforcement staff of the sec regarding a july 8 2015 outage on the nyse markets during which trading was suspended for approximately 35 hours in all symbols the investigation proceeded throughout 2016 and on december 29 2016 nyse received a wells notice stating that the staff have made a preliminary determination to recommend that the sec file an enforcement action in connection with how nyse responded on july 8 2015 to the circumstances leading into the suspension of trading that day the results of the wells notice and any enforcement action related to the july 8 2015 outage are unknown at this time 

in addition we have several other ongoing investigations and inquiries from the sec and other regulators that could lead to additional wells notices or enforcement actions we will continue to face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations financial condition or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business further any settlement consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or regulatory agencies begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities finally the implementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to remain competitive and grow our business 

we face intense competition 

we face intense competition in all aspects of our business and our competitors both domestic and international are numerous we currently compete with 

 trends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings finally many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and alternative trading system businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business 

we also face pricing competition in many areas of our business a decline in our fees due to competitive pressure the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for example interactive data’s business has benefited from a high renewal rate in its subscription based business but we cannot assure you that this will continue we also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers if we are not able to compete successfully our business could be materially impacted including our ability to sustain as an operating entity 

in our listings business the legal and regulatory environment in the us and the market perceptions about that environment may make it difficult for our us equity exchanges to compete with nonus equity exchanges for listings for example negative perceptions regarding compliance costs associated with adherence to corporate governance requirements have and may continue to discourage listings on us equity exchanges by both us and foreign private issuers any failure by our exchanges to successfully compete for any reason could adversely impact our revenue derived from listing fees and the associated trading execution and market data fees 

we may have difficulty maintaining our growth effectively 

we have achieved a tremendous amount of growth since becoming a public company in 2005 our growth is highly dependent on customer demand for our core products and services favorable economic conditions and our ability to invest in our personnel facilities infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls adverse economic conditions could reduce customer demand for our products and services which may place a significant strain on our management and resources and could force us to defer existing or future planned opportunities in addition we may not be successful in executing on our strategies to support our growth organically or as described above through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances 

we may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities 

we intend to launch new products and continue to explore and pursue other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may spend substantial time and money developing new product offerings or improving current product offerings if these offerings are not successful we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to recover the costs of such initiatives obtaining any required regulatory approval associated with these offerings may also result in delays or restrictions on our ability to fully benefit from these offerings further we may enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry attracting customers in certain countries may also be subject to a number of risks including currency exchange rate risk difficulties in enforcing agreements or collecting receivables longer payment cycles compliance with the laws or regulations of these countries and political and regulatory uncertainties 

in addition in light of consolidation in the exchange data services and clearing sectors and competition for opportunities we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully our competitors could merge making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors also offering new products and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives that are necessary for our success 

we have made substantial progress toward developing and deploying new technology platforms to improve our equity exchange business and data services business we may experience disruptions or encounter unexpected challenges in deploying these new systems further the costs to complete the remaining work may exceed our current expectations any significant cost increases or disruptions to product quality sales effectiveness or client service or to our other business operations could have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations 

we may fail to complete or realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our recent acquisitions and future acquisitions which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we have completed many acquisitions and plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures when we deem it appropriate the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to integrate these businesses into our existing operations and realize anticipated cost savings revenue synergies and growth opportunities we generally set aggressive timelines for realizing savings   which assumes we successfully undertake a variety of actions including but not limited to integrating technology eliminating redundancies and effecting organizational restructurings that are themselves subject to a variety of risks and may be subject to regulatory approvals that we do not control the process of integrating acquired companies is time consuming and could disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties including inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants regulators and others require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of the business 

there is a risk however that we may not integrate these acquired companies in a manner that permits our expected cost savings and revenue synergies to be fully realized in the time periods expected or at all in addition a variety of factors including but not limited to regulatory conditions governmental competition approvals currency fluctuations and difficulty integrating 

technology platforms may adversely affect our ability to complete our acquisitions or realize our anticipated cost savings and synergies for example the cma in the uk has ordered a divestment of trayport and we are currently in the process of appealing their decision if our appeal is successful the matter will be sent back to the cma for additional review and if we are not successful we will be forced to sell trayport if a sale is required there is no certainty of the price we could receive and we may also suffer a loss due to currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the pound sterling as of december 31 2016 the accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation for trayport was 117 million due to the decrease in the pound sterling which is trayport’s functional currency compared to the us dollar since the acquisition date if we are required to sell trayport we would include the accumulated translation adjustment when computing the gain or loss from the sale 

we may also not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures or alliances that we have entered into or may enter into for a number of reasons including regulatory or government approvals or changes global market changes contractual obligations competing products and in some instances our lack of or limited control over the management of the business further strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future 

we continue to look for strategic growth opportunities in line with our business strategy and will pursue acquisitions when we believe that they are in our best interests we may be very acquisitive as a result of any future acquisition we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest expend cash incur debt assume actual and contingent liabilities inherit existing or pending litigation or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets further we cannot assure you that any such financing or equity investments will be available with terms that will be favorable to us or available at all 

if we are unable to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences we may not be able to compete effectively 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary and acquired technology the financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change change in use patterns change in client preferences frequent product and service introductions and the emergence of new industry standards and practices these changes could render our existing proprietary technology uncompetitive or obsolete 

further we use some opensource software in our technology most often as small components within a larger product or service to augment algorithms functionalities or libraries we create and we may use more opensource software in the future opensource code is also contained in some thirdparty software we rely on we could be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of the license for such opensource software the terms of many opensource licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us or other courts and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology to our clients’ requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and costeffective manner any failure to remain abreast of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to client preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our revenues 

our business may be harmed by computer and communications systems failures and delays 

our business depends on the integrity reliability and security of our computer and communication systems we support and maintain many of the systems that comprise our electronic platforms and our failure to monitor or maintain these systems or to find replacements for defective components within a system in a timely and costeffective manner when necessary could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business our customers rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate and highquality financial market data analytics and related solutions our timely reliable delivery of highquality products and services is subject to an array of technical production processes that enable our delivery platforms to leverage an extensive range of content databases our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 



 we could experience system failures due to power or telecommunications failures human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyberattacks intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar events if any one or more of these situations were to arise they could result in damage to our business reputation and participant dissatisfaction with our electronic platform which could prompt participants to trade elsewhere or expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions as a consequence our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

our regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in volume of order and trading transaction traffic and to provide processing and clearing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

our systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks hacking and cyberattacks especially in light of our role in the global financial marketplace which could result in wrongful use of our information or which could make our participants reluctant to use our electronic platform 

the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to reliably transact on our electronic platforms and provide financial data services are critical elements of our operations some of our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential client data including client portfolio information if anyone gains improper access to our electronic platforms networks or databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify our confidential information or that of a third party our networks and those of our participants third party service providers and external market infrastructures may be vulnerable to compromise security technology failure social engineering denial of service attacks or other security failures resulting in loss of data integrity information disclosure unavailability or fraud recently the financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of political protest activism and fraud further former employees of certain companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly 

although we have not been the victim of cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cyber security events including distributed denial of service attacks malware infections phishing web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size for example we experienced a distributed denial of service attack against our website in november 2016 that activated automated mitigation response and was reportable to regulatory authorities we operate an information security program that is designed to prevent detect track and mitigate cyber incidents and that has detected and mitigated such incidents in the past although we intend to continually implement new industry standard security measures as they develop in the future to maintain the effectiveness of our information security program we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against attacks losses or reduced trading volume in our markets as a result of any security breach hacking or cyberattack any such attacks could result in reputational damage cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose customers cause us to experience lower current and future trading volumes or incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive position additionally current and future security measures may involve significant costs to purchase and maintain which could adversely impact our net income 

we currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness 

following our acquisition of nyse and interactive data we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis as of december 31 2016 we had 64 billion of outstanding debt this level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities as we use our available resources to reduce and refinance our consolidated debt our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue future business opportunities may be further restrained in addition the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio test and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other matters 

our longterm debt is currently rated by moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s these ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time and it is possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade our credit ratings in the future in particular our inability to sustain reduced debt on a consolidated basis may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings a significant downgrade of our credit rating could impact the regulatory status of our clearing houses make parties less willing to do business with us and could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase the cost of any future debt funding we may obtain 

damage to our reputation resulting from our administration of libor or other benchmarks could adversely affect our business 

our subsidiary iba is the administrator for various benchmarks including libor iba’s administration of libor is the result of the libor scandal which was a series of fraudulent actions taken by banks that were submitting false libor rates to profit from trades or to give the impression that the banks were more creditworthy than they were any failures or negative publicity resulting from our administration of libor or other benchmarks could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and could harm our reputation 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

since we conduct operations in several different countries including the us uk continental europe and canada substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling euros and canadian dollars because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

the european debt crisis and related european financial restructuring efforts have contributed to instability in global credit markets and resulted in a decline in the value of the pounds sterling and euro relative to the us dollar in addition brexit and the outcome of the us presidential election each have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially among the us dollar the british pound sterling and the euro if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the uk continental europe the us or other key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further the value of the pound sterling and euro and the global credit markets may further weaken general financial instability in countries in the european union including greece could have a contagion effect on the region and contribute to the general instability and uncertainty in the european union events that adversely affect our uk and continental european clients and suppliers could in turn have a materially adverse effect on our international business results and our results of operations 

for additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk refer to “ foreign currency exchange rate risk” in item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk which are included in this annual report 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill other intangible assets or investments 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2016 we had goodwill of 123 billion and net other intangible assets of 104 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties we recorded a 33 million impairment loss on our creditex customer relationship intangible asset during 2016 primarily due to the sale of our creditex us voice broker operations and the discontinuance of our creditex uk voice brokerage 

operations in 2016 as of december 31 2016 we have 432 million in longterm investments relating to our equity security investment in cetip sa or cetip we recorded a 190 million impairment loss on our investment in cetip during 2013 primarily due to the devaluation of the brazilian real as of december 31 2016 our investment in cetip included an accumulated unrealized gain of 108 million 

we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may result in asset impairments an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill other intangible assets and other investments and assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 

for additional information on our goodwill other intangible assets and investments including impairment refer to notes 5 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements and “ critical accounting policies  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets” in item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which are included in this annual report 

we may face liability for content contained in our data products and services 

we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation libel copyright or trademark infringement fraud or negligence or based on other theories of liability in each case relating to the data articles commentary ratings information or other content we distribute in our financial data services if such data or other content or information that we distribute has errors is delayed or has design defects we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our corporate website or those websites that we own and operate through links to other websites use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for significant amounts any such claim even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us could involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations and a negative impact on our reputation in addition we license and redistribute data and content from various third parties and the terms of these licenses change frequently our data and content suppliers may audit our use and our clients’ use and payment for data and content and may assert that we or our clients owe additional amounts under the terms of the license agreements that we inappropriately distributed the third partys data or that we or our clients used the data or content in a manner that exceeded the scope of the license agreement we may incur costs to investigate any such allegations and may be required to make unexpected payments to these data and content suppliers and these costs and payments could be material 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties including trademarks service marks trade names trade secrets copyrights and patents we cannot assure you that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property additionally we may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively further we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights which may require significant financial and managerial resources as a result we may choose not to enforce our infringed intellectual property rights depending on our strategic evaluation and judgment regarding the best use of our resources the relative strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the recourse available to us 

in addition our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may have obtained and may be expected to obtain in the future patent rights related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services as a result we may face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the holders of the patents or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patents we also could be required to pay damages if we were found to infringe patents held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we rely on third party providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of an important service data or content supplied by any third party or the loss of an exclusive license could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as online service providers hosting service and software providers data processors software and hardware vendors banks local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading clearing data services and other systems we rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with third parties and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for the provision of hosting services we also depend on thirdparty suppliers for data and content including data received from certain competitors clients various government and public record services and financial institutions used in our products and services some of this data is exclusive to particular suppliers and may not be obtained from other suppliers in addition our data suppliers could enter into exclusive contracts with our competitors without our knowledge the general trend toward industry consolidation may increase the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future if these companies were to discontinue providing services to us for any reason or fail to provide the type of service agreed to we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients or increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines our third party data suppliers perform audits on us from time to time in the ordinary course of business to determine if data we license for redistribution has been properly accounted for in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreement as a result of these audits we may incur additional expenses 

many of our clients also rely on third parties to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform if these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients’ inability to transact with our businesses we hold exclusive licenses to list various index futures and contracts in the future litigation or regulatory action may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and contracts trading to a single exchange and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license mifid ii introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of services relating to commodity derivatives across europe and the legislation requires open access to any benchmarks a benchmark is an index or other measure used to determine the value of a financial instrument for example libor or the sp 500 used in europe if unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive license were permitted we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products 

we are subject to significant litigation and liability risks 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our participants involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred for example dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platform or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades abusive trading practices security and confidentiality breaches mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants in addition because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by entering them inaccurately a large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets in addition we are subject to various legal disputes some of which we are involved in due to acquisition activity we could incur significant expenses defending claims even those without merit which could adversely affect our financing condition and operating results an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for a summary of our legal proceedings and claims 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

given our prominence in the global securities industry and the location of many of our properties and personnel in us and european financial centers including lower manhattan we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to 

attract and retain employees in addition terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets including trading on exchanges any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

owning and operating voice broker businesses exposes us to additional risk and these businesses are largely dependent on their brokerdealer clients 

our voice broker business is primarily transactionbased and it provides brokerage services to clients primarily in the form of agency transactions although it also engages in a limited number of matched principal transactions in agency transactions customers pay transaction fees for trade execution services in which we connect buyers and sellers who settle their transactions directly in matched principal transactions also known as “riskless principal” transactions we agree to buy instruments from one customer and sell them to another customer the amount of the fee generally depends on the spread between the buy and sell price of the security that is brokered with respect to matched principal transactions a counterparty to a matched principal transaction may fail to fulfill its obligations or we may face liability for an unmatched trade we also face the risk of not being able to collect transaction or processing fees charged to customers for brokerage services and processing services we provide 

we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt is dividends from our subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results further we have guaranteed the payment of certain obligations by our subsidiary nyse holdings llc this guarantee may require us to provide substantial funds or assets to creditors of our subsidiaries at a time when we are in need of liquidity to fund our own obligations and may affect our ability to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock 

provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ice 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for ice these provisions make a change of control less likely which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of us and european equity exchanges for example our organizational documents include provisions that generally restrict any person either alone or together with its related persons from i voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10 of our outstanding voting capital stock including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock or ii beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock further our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to call special stockholders’ meetings or act by written consent and generally authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock in addition provisions of delaware law may have a similar effect such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders as defined under delaware law from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the board of directors

on june 30 2016 we acquired a majority equity position in merscorp holdings inc owner of mortgage electronic registrations systems inc or collectively “mers” mers is a privately held memberbased organization that owns and manages the mers® system and is made up of thousands of lenders servicers subservicers investors and government institutions in addition we have entered into a software development agreement to rebuild the mers® system to benefit the us residential mortgage finance market the mers® system is a national electronic registry that tracks the changes in servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in usbased mortgage loans this new infrastructure is expected to shift its operation to an ice data center in the first half of 2018

on december 14 2015 we acquired 100  of interactive data in a stock and cash transaction the total purchase price was 56 billion  comprised of cash consideration of 41 billion  and 323 million  shares of our common stock on a postsplit basis and their results are included in our consolidated results effective from the acquisition date the cash consideration is gross of 301 million  of cash held by interactive data on the date of the acquisition the cash consideration was funded from 25 billion  of net proceeds received on november 24 2015 in connection with the offering of new senior notes and 16 billion  of borrowing under our commercial paper program 

on december 11 2015 we acquired 100  of trayport in a stock transaction trayport is a software company that licenses its technology to serve exchanges otc brokers and traders to facilitate electronic and hybrid trade execution primarily in the energy markets the total purchase price was 620 million  comprised of 126 million  shares of our common stock on a postsplit basis and their results are included in our consolidated results effective from the acquisition date 

the uk competition and markets authority or the cma undertook a review of our acquisition of trayport under the merger control laws of the uk during the pendency of the review we did not integrate trayport into our existing business operations on october 17 2016 the cma issued its findings and ordered a divestment of trayport to remedy what the cma indicated it believed to be a substantial lessening of competition in the supply of trade execution services and trade clearing services to energy traders in the european economic area in november 2016 we filed an appeal to challenge the cma’s decision the outcome of the appeal is expected to be determined in 2017 if our appeal is successful the matter will be sent back to the cma for additional review if our appeal is not successful we will be forced to sell trayport and there is no certainty of the price we could receive if a sale were required the timing of a final decision is uncertain at this time 

the functional currency of trayport is the pound sterling as this is the currency in which trayport operates the 620 million in trayport net assets were recorded on our december 11 2015 opening balance sheet at a pound sterlingus dollar exchange rate of 15218 £407 million because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate the trayport net assets into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the pound sterling will affect the value of the trayport balance sheet with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account a component of equity as of the result of the decrease in the pounds sterlingus dollar exchange rate to 12336 as of december 31 2016  the portion of our equity attributable to the trayport net assets in accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was 117 million as of december 31 2016  if we are required to sell trayport we would include the accumulated translation adjustment when computing the gain or loss from the sale

we continued to monitor potential impairment triggering events in our cds trade execution business during 2016 including the impacts of divesting the brokerage business changes in the business and regulatory climate in which the remaining business operates the volatility in the capital markets our recent operating performance and our current financial projections based on an analysis of these factors it was determined that the carrying value of the cds creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in september 2016 for 33 million the impairment was recorded as amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2016 as of december 31 2016 the remaining creditex customer relationship intangible asset is 14 million and will continue to be amortized over the remaining useful life through august 2020

market analysis and to a lesser extent revenue increases in our exchangerelated data services and brent crude and agricultural transaction and clearing we recognized 11 billion in interactive data trayport securities evaluations and credit market analysis data services revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 50 million in interactive data and trayport data services revenues for the year ended december 31 2015 subsequent to their acquisitions in december 2015 partially offsetting the revenue increases were unfavorable foreign exchange effects of 59 million arising from the strengthening us dollar primarily impacting revenues billed in pounds sterling for the year ended december 31 2016 from the comparable period in 2015  

 business environment and market trends 

our business environment has been characterized by industry consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading clearing and listings the globalization of exchanges customers and competitors market participants’ rising demand for speed data capacity and connectivity which requires ongoing investment in technology evolving and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions and increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies 

price volatility increases the need to hedge risk and creates demand among market participants for the exchange of risk through trading and clearing market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market’s strength in addition the ability to evolve existing products to serve emerging needs develop new products and respond to competitive dynamics in pricing exclusivity and consolidation is important to our business changes in these and other factors could cause our revenues to fluctuate from period to period and these fluctuations may affect the reliability of period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results for additional information regarding the factors that affect our results of operations see item 1a “risk factors” included elsewhere in this annual report 

the implementation of new laws or regulations or the uncertainty around potential changes may impact participation in our markets or the demand for our clearing and data services either favorably or unfavorably many of the recent changes with regard to 

global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets centralized clearing and access to data all of which are important aspects of our product offering however some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been propagated are being reconsidered in europe final regulations related to mifid ii have not yet been implemented and significant uncertainties and ambiguities remain around such regulations as this is established legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data as a result it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us as discussed more fully in item 1 “ business  regulation” included elsewhere in this annual report the implementation of mifid ii and other regulations may result in operational regulatory andor business risk 

in recent years low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a relatively slow or yet to occur global economic recovery lower growth in asia and the european union may also continue to affect global financial markets in addition economic and regulatory uncertainty coupled with periods of high market volatility around geopolitical events low interest rates and low oil and natural gas prices has affected our clients’ activities in recent years the duration of these trends will determine the continued impact on our business across trading and listings we have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class in addition we have increased our portion of nontransaction and clearing revenues from 13 in 2012 to 57 in 2016 this nontransaction revenue includes data services listings and other revenues we continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams as well as on our companywide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data clearing and markets 

in recent years financial institutions and corporations have acted to control spending including on financial information and related services yet many of the data products and services we sell are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels while we expect that cost containment pressures will continue we anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends including the following increasing global regulatory demands greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations greater emphasis on risk management market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes the move to passive investing and indexation ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets increased electronification of fixed income and other less automated markets the development of new data products the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity new entrants and increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions we contract with clients through data fixedfee subscriptions variable fees based on usage or a combination of fixedfee subscription and usagebased fees in addition some of our data services generate onetime or nonrecurring revenue such as onetime purchases of historical data setup services or implementation fees 

segment reporting 

we operated as a single reportable business segment as of december 31 2015 but began operating as two operating segments in the first quarter of 2016 following our acquisition of interactive data as of december 31 2016  we continue to operate as two business segments our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment this presentation is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviews and operates our business our trading and clearing segment comprises our transactionbased execution and clearing businesses our data and listings segment comprises our subscriptionbased data services and securities listings businesses our chief operating decision maker does not review total assets intersegment revenuesexpenses or statements of income below operating income by segments therefore such information is not presented below 

while revenues are allocated directly to segments a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of both segments because these expenses do not relate to a single segment we have employed a reasonable allocation method to allocate expenses between the segments for presentation purposes we have elected to use a prorata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment further precise allocation of expenses to specific revenue streams within these segments is not reasonably possible accordingly we did not allocate expenses to specific revenue streams within the segments 

trading and clearing segment 

the following charts and table present our selected statements of income data for our trading and clearing segment from continuing operations dollars in millions

transaction and clearing revenues 

overview 

our transaction and clearing revenues are reported on a net basis except for the nyse transactionbased expenses discussed below and consist of fees collected from our derivatives trading and clearing and from our cash trading and equity options exchanges in our derivatives markets we earn transaction and clearing revenues from both counterparties to each contract that is traded andor cleared and in our equity and equity options markets we receive trade execution fees as well as routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution 

rates percontract are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract net of certain rebates our percontract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors including but not limited to market conditions transaction and clearing volume product mix pricing applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements and new product introductions because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a percontract basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and though not to the same degree due to product mix 

for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  19 20 and 26 respectively of our trading and clearing segment revenues less transactionbased expenses were billed in pounds sterling or euros as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes the us equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the us dollar our trading and clearing segment revenues less transactionbased expenses decreased 35 million for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  and decreased 49 million for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  see item 3 “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk” below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations 

our transaction and clearing fees are presented net of rebates we recorded rebates of 674 million 563 million and 466 million for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded the increase in the rebates is due primarily to an increase 

in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts an increase in our traded volume and an increase in the number of rebate programs 

commodities markets 

we operate global crude oil and refined oil futures markets including the ice brent ice wti and ice gasoil futures and options contracts as well as over 400 refined oil futures products that relate to our benchmark futures contracts the ice brent crude futures contract is relied upon by a broad range of global market participants including oil producing nations and multinational companies to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption ice gasoil is a key refined oil benchmark in europe and asia total oil volume and revenues increased 12 and 10 respectively for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  and increased 17 and 14 respectively for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014

our global natural gas futures and options volume declined 2 and revenues increased 4 for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  respectively and volume declined 4 and revenues increased 3 for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  respectively global natural gas volume declined the last two years due to lower price volatility related to high natural gas supplies but revenues increased due to geographic product mix 

total volume and revenues in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets increased 11 and 8 respectively for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  and increased 13 and 11 respectively for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  volume in our largest agricultural contract sugar futures and options remained flat for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  and increased 18 for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  volume in our other agricultural and metal futures and options volume increased 21 for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  and increased 9 for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  the increases in agricultural volume were primarily driven by increased price volatility due to changing supply and demand expectations largely related to weather and production levels 

financial markets 

financial futures and options volume increased 10 and revenues decreased 6 respectively for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  and decreased 9 and 14 respectively for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  interest rate futures and options volume increased 12 for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  and decreased 11 for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  interest rate futures and options volume increased for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily due to uncertainty around central bank actions economic data during 2016 and the uks decision to exit the european union revenues decreased while volume increased for the interest rates futures and options for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and increased market making rebates that apply at higher volume levels 

other financial futures and options volume increased 5 for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  and decreased 4 for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  other financial futures and options volume increased for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily due to changes in price volatility in equity indexes driven by equity market volatility volume in our msci futures and options contracts increased 49 for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  due to global equity market volatility 

cash equities handled volume increased 6 for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  primarily due to increased market volatility during the first half of 2016 cash equities handled volume increased 13 for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  primarily due to increased market volatility throughout 2015 cash equities revenues net of transactionbased expenses were 223 million 220 million and 188 million for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively

transactionbased expenses were 98 million 112 million and 145 million for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively equity options volume and revenues decreased the last several years primarily due to the restructuring of the nyse amex options business while revenues declined the last several years the overall financial contribution of equity options was consistent with the prior years due to the retention of a higher percentage of profits from nyse amex options driven by our repurchase of the equity in the exchange from the minority shareholders 

cds clearing revenues were 107 million 100 million and 97 million for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the notional value of cds cleared during the same periods were 115 trillion 119 trillion and 137 trillion respectively buyside participation at our us cds clearing house ice clear credit reached record levels in terms of number of participants and notional cleared due to increased participation from both us and european buyside customers due to greater regulatory certainty the breadth of products offered and cost efficient margining in the us relative to europe

other revenues 

other revenues include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits regulatory penalties and fines fees for use of our facilities regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our us securities exchanges designated market maker service fees exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees the increase in other revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  is primarily due to increases in the interest income recognized on certain clearing margin deposits and fees earned on noncash collateral placed by clearing members primarily due to fee changes and increased clearing margin deposits

in addition other corporate actionsrelated listing fees are paid by listed companies in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares such as stock splits rights issues and sales of additional securities as well as mergers and acquisitions other corporate actionsrelated listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straightline basis over estimated service periods of six years for nyse and three years for nyse arca and nyse mkt unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet 

listings revenues increased for the last two years primarily due to the amortization of the original listing fees earned since the acquisition of nyse and due to additional annual listing fee revenue from new customers the listings unamortized deferred revenue balance as of december 31 2016  of 149 million relates to original and other corporate action listing fees incurred and billed and not yet recognized as revenue subsequent to the november 13 2013 acquisition through december 31 2016

the majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our financial performance as discussed below the following chart and table present our operating expenses from continuing operations dollars in millions 

  



we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with our acquisitions and growth of our business and to vary from year to year based on the type and level of our acquisitions and other investments 

for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  18 12 and 18 respectively of our consolidated operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes the us equivalent of operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the us dollar our consolidated operating expenses decreased 40 million for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  and decreased 17 million for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  see item 3 “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk” below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations 

compensation and benefits expenses 

compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes noncapitalized employee wages bonuses noncash or stock compensation certain severance costs benefits and employer taxes the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance and the performancebased restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance therefore our compensation and benefits expense will vary year to year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in the number of employees 

compensation and benefits expenses increased for the last two years primarily due to increases in employee headcount our employee headcount increased primarily due to the acquisitions of interactive data trayport securities evaluations credit market analysis superderivatives singapore mercantile exchange and holland clearing house converting contractor roles to employees at nyse and hiring for clearing technology regulation and compliance headcount increased from 2879 employees at december 31 2013 excluding the euronext and nyse technologies employees to 2902 employees as of december 31 2014  increased to 5549 employees as of december 31 2015  and increased to 5631 employees as of december 31 2016  we recognized 342 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to the interactive data trayport securities evaluations and credit market analysis acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 17 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to interactive data and trayport during the year ended december 31 2015  subsequent to their acquisitions the employee increases associated with these acquisitions were partially offset by employee terminations for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  for nyse and for the year ended december 31 2016  for interactive data in connection with our integrations 

we recorded 33 million 20 million and 99 million in nyse and interactive data employee severance costs during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively with such costs included in the acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs discussed below and primarily related to executive departures in addition we incurred nonacquisition related employee severance costs of 10 million 3 million and 4 million for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively noncash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were 123 million 111 million and 82 million for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the increases in noncash compensation expenses primarily relates to a greater number of employees receiving noncash awards due to the headcount increases discussed above

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating the following tables present our nonoperating income expenses dollars in millions 



interest expense increased for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  primarily due to the interest expense we recognized on the additional debt incurred to finance the interactive data acquisition in december 2015 interest expense increased for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  primarily due to interest expense that we recognized relating to new debt we incurred for the interactive data acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2015 partially offset by the repayment of 10 billion in nyse eur notes on june 30 2015 see “ debt” below 

we account for our investment in cetip as an availableforsale investment and it is classified as a longterm investment in our consolidated balance sheet we recognized dividend income primarily received relating to our cetip investment in other income which was 19 million 16 million and 23 million for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we account for our investments in mers and the options clearing corporation or occ as equity method investments we recognized 25 million 6 million and 25 million in equity income related to these investments during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively as other income

income tax provision 

consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations was 580 million  358 million  and 402 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pretax income and the changes in our effective tax rate each year our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 29  22  and 29  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable foreign income tax rate differentials and favorable tax law changes partially offset by state income taxes favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower tax rates in the uk and various other lower tax jurisdictions as compared to the tax rates in the us 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 the uk reduced the corporate income tax rate from 20 to 19 effective april 1 2017 and to 18 effective april 1 2020 during the third quarter of 2016 the uk further reduced their corporate income tax rate from 18 to 17 effective april 1 2020 the reduction in the future uk corporate income tax rates resulted in deferred tax benefits the impact of the deferred tax benefit for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  lower the effective tax rate by 2 and 4 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  is primarily due to the tax impact of foreign versus us based pretax income lower deferred tax benefit associated with the future uk income tax rate reduction and greater favorable settlements with various taxing authorities in 2015 partially offset by a tax benefit from the early adoption of asu 201609 in 2016 the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future uk income tax rate reductions along with certain favorable settlements with various taxing authorities see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere is this annual report for additional information on these tax items

1 we acquired securities evaluations and credit market analysis on october 3 2016 trayport on december 11 2015 and interactive data on december 14 2015 and have included their financial results in our results of operations for the periods subsequent to their acquisitions dates including all revenues from these acquisitions in data services revenues 

2 the increase in the depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended september 30 2016 is primarily due to the 33 million creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment see “ recent developments  creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment” above 

3 the decrease in the income tax expenses for the three months ended september 30 2016 and for the three months ended december 31 2015 is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future uk income tax rate reductions see “ consolidated income tax provision” above 

liquidity and capital resources 

below are charts that reflect our capital allocation the acquisition and integration costs in the chart below includes both the net cash paid for the acquisitions and the acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs in each year 

we have financed our operations growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures working capital strategic acquisitions and investments stock repurchases dividends to our shareholders and the continued development of our electronic trading and clearing platforms we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt as it matures in the future we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities which we may be unable to do or to do on favorable terms we used the cash proceeds from the euronext ipo and sale to repay debt and we used the net cash proceeds from the sale of select nyse technology businesses to repay debt invest in growth initiatives pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases see “ discontinued operations” above and “ debt” and “ future capital requirements” below 

on october 3 2016 we acquired securities evaluations and credit market analysis for 431 million in cash the cash consideration was funded from borrowing under our commercial paper program on december 14 2015 we acquired interactive data in a stock and cash transaction the total purchase price was 56 billion  comprised of cash consideration of 41 billion  and 323 million  shares of our common stock the cash consideration is gross of 301 million  of cash held by interactive data on the date of the acquisition the cash consideration was funded from 25 billion  of net proceeds received on november 24 2015 in connection with the offering of new senior notes and 16 billion  of borrowing under our commercial paper program on december 11 2015 we acquired trayport in a stock transaction the total purchase price was 620 million  comprised of 126 million  shares of our common stock 

our commercial paper program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to delever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities we reduced our outstanding commercial paper during the year ended december 31 2016  by 949 million enabled by strong cash flows and a reduction in our unrestricted cash balance partially offset by 431 million in commercial paper borrowing in october 2016 to fund the purchase price of the securities evaluations and credit market analysis acquisitions 

upon maturity of old issuances of commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper to mitigate the rollover risk we maintain an undrawn backstop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper 

program if we were not able to issue new commercial paper we have the option of drawing on the backstop revolving facility however electing to do so would result in higher interest expense see “ debt” below 

consolidated cash and cash equivalents were 407 million  and 627 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively we had 432 million  and 299 million  in longterm investments as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively and 943 million  and 920 million  in shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively we consider all shortterm highly liquid investments with remaining maturity dates of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents we classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as shortterm investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as longterm investments cash and investments that are not available for general use either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements are classified as restricted cash and investments 

as of december 31 2016  the amount of unrestricted cash held by our nonus subsidiaries was 250 million while we consider our nonus earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas if these cash balances are needed for our operations in the us any repatriation by way of dividend may be subject to both us federal and state income taxes as adjusted for any nonus tax credits however we do not have any current needs or foreseeable future needs or other plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our nonus subsidiaries 

our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of nonspeculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash such as overnight deposits term deposits money market funds mutual funds for treasury investments short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets we may invest a portion of our cash in excess of shortterm operating needs in investmentgrade marketable debt securities including government or government sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities 

certain of these investments with an original maturity of greater than three months will be classified as availableforsale in accordance with relevant accounting standards availableforsale investments are carried at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income realized gains and losses and declines in value deemed to be otherthantemporary on availableforsale investments are recognized currently in earnings we do not have any investments classified as heldtomaturity or trading

in august 2016 our board of directors approved an aggregate of 10 billion  for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date subject to applicable laws and regulations repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market through established plans in privatelynegotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with all applicable securities laws rules and regulations we have entered into a rule 10b51 trading plan as authorized by our board of directors to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock and we began to repurchase shares in october 2016 we may discontinue the stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate the rule 10b51 trading plan at any time the approval of our board of directors for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock in addition our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time and our purchases will generally depend upon market conditions our stock price our target debt ratio and corporate debt rating and our strategic growth initiatives at that time we expect funding for any share repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our debt facilities or commercial paper program the shares repurchased are held in treasury stock as of december 31 2016 the remaining board authorization permits repurchases of up to 950 million  of our common stock with no fixed expiration date 

cash flow 

the following presents the major components of net increases decreases in cash and cash equivalents in millions 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations is primarily attributable to increases and decreases in our net income between periods and due to fluctuations in working capital 

the 838 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2016  from the comparable period in 2015  is primarily due to 393 million in cash provided by operating activities for interactive data trayport securities evaluations and credit market analysis for the year ended december 31 2016  increase in the net income of our historical income statement excluding the acquisitions and other fluctuations in working capital including the impact of the increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2015 as discussed below the 152 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  is primarily due to normal changes in operating cash flow during the year and timing of repayment of accrued expenses including an increase of 204 million in cash paid for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014

future capital requirements 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate of growth across our trading and clearing and data and listings segments strategic plans and acquisitions available sources for financing activities required technology and clearing initiatives regulatory requirements the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products the geographic mix of our business potential stock repurchases and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic trading and clearing platforms we currently expect to make aggregate operational capital expenditures and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between 280 million and 300 million for the year ended december 31 2017 which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology business integration and the continued growth of our businesses in addition we currently expect between 40 million to 45 million in real estate capital expenditures during 2017 for leasehold improvements primarily associated with our new york headquarters 

our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board of directors or audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio during the year ended december 31 2016  we paid cash dividends of 068 per share of our common stock in the aggregate including 2016 quarterly dividends of 017 per share for an aggregate payout of 409 million in 2016 which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last two years for the first quarter of 2017 we announced a 020 per share dividend which is a 18 increase over the prior dividend which is payable on march 31 2017 to shareholders of record as of march 16 2017 

as of december 31 2016  we had 64 billion  in outstanding debt we currently have a 34 billion  credit facility after factoring in the 16 billion  required to backstop the commercial paper program as of december 31 2016  18 billion  of our credit facility is currently available for general corporate purposes the credit facility and our commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have with third parties for liquidity and capital resources in the event of any strategic acquisitions mergers or investments or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders we may incur additional debt issue additional equity to raise necessary funds repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend however we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us see “ debt” above 

in connection with our acquisition of nyse we assumed nyse’s pension plans covering its us and certain european operations the benefit accrual for the us operations pension plan is frozen following the euronext ipo in june 2014 there are no longer any nyse european operations covered by the pension plans during the year ended december 31 2016  we contributed 10 million  to our pension plans our practice is to fund our frozen defined benefit pension plan each year at a level above the minimum required contribution but within tax deductible limits based on actuarial projections we estimate that a contribution of 10 million in 2017 will allow us to meet our funding goal however the actual contribution is contingent on the actual plan performance relative to assumptions 

nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than gaap measures alone in addition we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for periodtoperiod comparison of results because the items described below as adjustments to gaap are not reflective of our core business performance these financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to gaap financial measures and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance we strongly recommend that investors review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 

adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income attributable to ice common shareholders from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments in millions except for percentages and per share amounts all share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 5for1 stock split that was effected in the fourth quarter of 2016 





acquisitionrelated transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses except for those that are directly related to the announcement closing financing or termination of a transaction however the acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs relating to nyse and interactive data are included in nongaap adjustments given the sizes of these acquisitions as of december 31 2016 the integration of nyse has been completed and we will no longer include any nyse integration costs as nongaap adjustments in the future amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles are included in nongaap adjustments as excluding these noncash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results 

during the year ended december 31 2016 we also include as nongaap adjustments the creditex uk voice brokerage severance costs related to its discontinuance and the creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense as they are not part of our core business operations during the year andor three months ended december 31 2015 we also include as nongaap adjustments various litigation settlements and accruals and the interest expense on the senior notes and commercial paper we issued for the interactive data acquisition from the issuance date of the new senior notes on november 24 2015 and on the issuance dates of the commercial paper in early december 2015 to the acquisition date of interactive data on december 14 2015 as they are not part of our core business operations during the year and three months ended december 31 2014 we also include as nongaap adjustments the net gain on the sale of our 6 remaining ownership in euronext and the income recognized on our occ equity investment as they are not part of our core business operations 

the income tax effects relating to the items above are included in nongaap adjustments as well as deferred tax adjustments on acquisitionrelated intangibles and other tax adjustments the tax items in nongaap adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pretax nongaap adjustments or are tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance deferred tax adjustments on acquisitionrelated intangibles relates primarily to future uk corporate income tax rate reductions with deferred tax benefits of 34 million and 60 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively further deferred tax adjustments on acquisitionrelated intangibles include the impact of us state tax law and apportionment changes which resulted in a deferred tax expense of 12 million for the year ended december 31 2016 and a deferred tax benefit of 22 million and 14 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively other tax adjustments for the year ended december 31 2016 relate to a 15 million valuation allowance on singapore preacquisition net operating losses and other deferred tax assets and an 8 million deferred tax adjustment with respect to our occ equity method investment other tax adjustments for year ended december 31 2015 represents a 7 million uncertain tax position relating to a retrospective foreign tax law change for a preacquisition period and for the year ended december 31 2014 represents 12 million of foreign tax expense in connection with the ipo of euronext and the integration of liffe

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table presents for the periods indicated our contractual obligations which we intend to fund from our existing cash as well as cash flow from operations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2016  in millions 



purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above 552 billion in cash margin deposits and guaranty fund liabilities clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund the cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits and guaranty funds’ liabilities 

we have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits or utbs from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above as of december 31 2016  our cumulative utbs were 112 million interest and penalties related to utbs were 35 million as of december 31 2016  we are under examination by various tax authorities we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax interest and penalties if any that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our utbs 

as of december 31 2016  in connection with our acquisition of nyse we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs the date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs 

we have a 40 ownership in occ under the occs capital plan the occ shareholders have committed to contribute up to 200 million in equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached including up to 80 million to be contributed by nyse 

new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us 

critical accounting policies 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the accounting matters described below we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments based on these factors we make estimates and judgments about among other things the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies among others affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results assets and liabilities 

goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 

we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired including other identified intangible assets we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift our judgments may change which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances as of december 31 2016  we had goodwill of 123 billion and net other intangible assets of 104 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

in performing the purchase price allocation we consider among other factors the intended future use of acquired assets analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business at the acquisition date a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation we continue to review and validate estimates assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period accordingly these estimates and assumptions are subject to change which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition 

our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangibles to its estimated fair value we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to 

benefit from the business combination we had previously identified three reporting units our futures reporting unit our cds reporting unit and our cash listings reporting unit during the year ended december 31 2016 we conducted a review to determine the appropriate reporting units as a result of operating under two business segments effective january 1 2016 and following our acquisition of interactive data in december 2015 this review has led to the identification of four reporting units our futures reporting unit our cds reporting unit our cash reporting unit and our data and listings reporting unit 

goodwill impairment testing consists of a twostep methodology the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value including goodwill and other intangible assets of such reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no impairment loss is recognized and the second step which is a calculation of the impairment is not performed however if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value for annual goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill and other intangible assets if we conclude that this is the case we must perform the twostep methodology described above otherwise we can skip the twostep methodology and do not need to perform any further testing for annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount 

application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows longterm growth rates of our business operating margins discount rates weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets these estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment and changes to these estimates and assumptions as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor impairment the cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and when applicable various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of our business adverse market conditions adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations competition or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill through december 31 2016  

we are also required to evaluate other finitelived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable if impairment indicators are present then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these longlived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable if an asset is not recoverable the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis 

among our finitelived intangible assets during the year ended december 31 2015 we performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis to test whether the cds creditex customer relationship intangible asset was recoverable as we concluded that indicators of impairment were present cds trade execution revenues at creditex have decreased over the last several years as trading volumes in the global cds market have declined and cds trading remains muted due to financial reform implementation and lower volatility in corporate credit markets we identified the decline in revenues and the delay in their expected recovery as a triggering event requiring our creditex customer relationship intangible asset to be tested for recoverability as of december 31 2015 the creditex customer relationship intangible asset had a remaining net book value of 61 million and will become fully amortized in august 2020 the results of the recoverability test indicated that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the asset by 8 therefore no impairment was recorded for the year ended december 31 2015 

in august 2016 we sold certain of creditex’s us voice brokerage operations to tullett prebon during the third quarter of 2016 we discontinued creditex’s uk voice brokerage operations we continue to operate creditexs electronically traded markets and systems posttrade connectivity platforms and intellectual property we continued to monitor potential impairment triggering events in our cds trade execution business during 2016 including the impacts of divesting the brokerage business changes in the business and regulatory climate in which the remaining business operates the volatility in the capital markets our recent operating performance and our current financial projections based on an analysis of these factors it was determined that the carrying value of the cds creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in september 2016 for 33 million the impairment was recorded as amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2016 as of december 31 2016 the remaining creditex customer relationship intangible asset is 14 million and will continue to be amortized over the remaining useful life through august 2020 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us uk and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse 

we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position if the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 

the undistributed earnings from our nonus subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no provision for us federal and state income taxes has been made in our consolidated financial statements a distribution of these nonus earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise could subject us to both us federal and state income taxes as adjusted for nonus tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various nonus countries determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable 

we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter at any point in time many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities changes in facts and circumstances issuance of new regulations and resolution of tax audits 

we believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 




 

item 7 a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a result of our operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure manage monitor and report risk exposures which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2016  and 2015  our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments were 14 billion and 16 billion respectively of which 294 million and 439 million respectively were denominated in pounds sterling euros or canadian dollars the remaining cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments are denominated in us dollars we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes a hypothetical decrease in longterm interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pretax earnings by 3 million as of december 31 2016  assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments 

our investment in cetip which is recorded as an availableforsale longterm investment was valued at 432 million as of december 31 2016  including an accumulated unrealized gain of 108 million changes in the fair value of the cetip investment are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and do not impact earnings except to the extent that unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary 

as of december 31 2016  we had 64 billion  in outstanding debt of which 39 billion relates to senior notes and 851 million relates to the nyse notes all of which bear interest at fixed interest rates the remaining amount outstanding of 16 billion relates to 

the commercial paper program which bears interest at fluctuating rates and therefore subjects us to interest rate risk a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in longterm interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31 2016  would decrease annual pretax earnings by 16 million assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  debt” included elsewhere in this annual report 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as an international business we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros certain assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries our exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table dollars in millions except exchange rates 

 we have a significant part of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros for the year ended december 31 2016  15 of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros and 18 of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes the us equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly 

we have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables that occur through our operations which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods we had foreign currency transaction losses of 1 million 14 million and 2 million for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar which strengthened a 10 adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2016  would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of 1 million assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity 

we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities 

we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using a current rate of exchange with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account a component of equity our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below in millions 



as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was 345 million and 45 million respectively as of december 31 2016  we had net exposure of pounds sterling and euro of £12 billion 14 billion and €130 million 137 million respectively based on these december 31 2016  net currency positions a hypothetical 10 decrease of pound sterling against us dollar would negatively impact our equity by 143 million and a hypothetical 10 decrease of euro against us dollar would negatively impact our equity by 14 million for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  currency exchange rate differences had a negative impact of 300 million 58 million and 130 million respectively on our consolidated equity the decrease for the year ended december 31 2016  is primarily due to the decrease in the pound sterlingus dollar exchange rate to 12336 as of december 31 2016  from 14868 as of december 31 2015 due to the weakening pound sterling the pound sterling decreased starting in june 2016 following the uk referendum that resulted in a vote for the uk to leave the european union the future impact on our business relating to the uk leaving the european union and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time including future impacts on currency exchange rates 

credit risk 

we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments wellcapitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties 

an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties our policies require diversification of counterparties banks financial institutions bond issuers and funds so as to avoid a concentration of risk 

clearing house cash deposit risks 

our clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit market and liquidity risks refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for more information about clearing house cash deposits which were 552 billion  as of december 31 2016  while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits as the clearing houses may pass on interest revenues minus costs to the members this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated 

credit risk 

when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits reflecting a number of factors including ratings assigned by rating agencies cds spreads and internal ratings as well as the nature and maturity of transactions we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring financial assets are placed with governments wellcapitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties 

an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties our policies require diversification of counterparties banks financial institutions bond issuers and funds to avoid a concentration of risk 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency in the right place and the right time to mitigate this risk the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a 

manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets for example holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of purchased securities to decline if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity and interest rates had risen the sale of the securities might be made at a loss relative to the latest market price our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments of cash deposits for example where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities in addition the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt for example us treasury securities and supranational debt instruments euro cash deposits only with short dated maturities 

security issuer risk 

security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments 

investment counterparty risk 

investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and thus fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral under the repurchase agreement to high quality issuers when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts under clearing house control additionally the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2 of the reverse repurchase amount thus in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty’s obligation to the clearing house 

our clearing houses may use third party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided to them by the clearing house such investment advisors do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control clearing house property is held with credit worthy custodians including jpmorgan chase bank na citibank na bny mellon bmo harris na and euroclear bank brussels for nonus dollar deposits 

each clearing house employs or may employ multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single investment advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role additional investment advisors or custodians are available as alternatives 

crosscurrency margin deposit risk 

each of our clearing houses pursuant to their rules may permit posting of crosscurrency collateral to satisfy margin requirements for example accepting margin deposits denominated in us dollars to secure a euro margin obligation the clearing houses mitigate the risk of a decline in currency value by applying a “haircut” to the currency posted as margin at a level sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of high currency volatility crosscurrency balances are markedtomarket on a daily basis should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a sameday basis 

impact of inflation 

we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or to decline in the event of inflation we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants as the prices that we charge are not governed by longterm contracts

competition 

the execution markets in which we operate are global and highly competitive we face competition in all aspects of our business from a number of different enterprises both domestic and international including traditional exchanges electronic trading platforms data vendors and voice brokers we believe we compete on the basis of a number of factors including 

• depth and liquidity of markets 

• price transparency 

• reliability and speed of trade execution and processing 

• technological capabilities and innovation 

• breadth of products and services 

• rate and quality of new product developments 

• quality of service

• transaction costs and 

• reputation 

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that our deep liquid markets breadth of product offerings new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to develop new and innovative products and services enhance our technology infrastructure maintain liquidity and offer competitive transaction costs

 in addition to competition from derivative exchanges that offer commodity products we also face competition from other exchanges electronic trading systems thirdparty clearing houses and technology firms additional ventures could form or have been formed to provide services that could potentially compete with certain services that we provide 

we compete with voice brokers active in the credit derivatives markets other electronic trading platforms for derivatives clearing houses and market data vendors ice swap trade creditex and creditex brokerage compete with other swap execution facilities and large interdealer brokers in the credit derivatives market 

we face significant competition with respect to equities trading and this competition is expected to remain intense our current and prospective competitors include regulated markets electronic communication networks dark pools and other alternative trading systems market makers and other execution venues we also face competition from large brokers and customers that may assume the role of principal and act as counterparty to orders originating from retail customers or by matching their respective order flows through bilateral trading arrangements including through internalization of order flow 

our principal competitor for listings in the us is nasdaq omx group inc or nasdaq omx as well as bats we also face competition for foreign issuer listings from a number of stock exchanges outside the us including the london stock exchange deutsche börse euronext and stock exchanges in hong kong and toronto as other liquidity venues seek exchange status we may face more competition for listings 

nyse arca and nyse amex options face considerable competition in the equity options markets their principal us competitors are the chicago board options exchange inc or cboe the international securities exchange holdings inc bats and nasdaq omx 

competition within our interactive data pricing and reference data business includes inhouse sources such as a firm’s trading desk and existing information purchased or obtained for other purposes or through informal industry relationships and sources such as broker quotes as well as thirdparty information providers the main thirdparty competitors with respect to our evaluated pricing and reference data offerings as well as our trading solutions business include large global suppliers of financial and business news and financial market data such as bloomberg lp and thomson reuters corporation additionally we have specialized competitors in structured products derivatives and other complex securities

clearing services 

we currently operate six clearing houses our clearing strategy is designed to provide financial stability to the markets served by us while providing capital efficiency and meeting the risk management capital and regulatory requirements of a global marketplace our clearing houses clear settle and guarantee the financial performance of futures contracts and options on futures contracts ice clear europe also clears european cds instruments and ice clear credit clears north american european and emerging market cds instruments through each of our clearing houses we maintain a system for the performance of obligations for the products we clear this system is supported by several mechanisms including 

 the amount of margin and guaranty fund deposits fluctuates over time as a result of among other things the extent of open positions held at any point in time by market participants and the volatility of the market as reflected in the applicable margin rates for such contracts 

clearing house risk management practices 

our clearing houses have an excellent track record of risk management and have never experienced an incident of a clearing member default which has required the use of the guaranty funds of nondefaulting clearing members or the assets of the clearing house nevertheless we have extensive risk management procedures in place to ensure we protect the interests of our clearing members and clearing houses each of our clearing houses has instituted a multilayered risk management system of rules policies and procedures to protect itself in the event of a clearing member default 

to ensure performance our clearing houses maintain extensive technology and quantitative risk management systems as well as financial and operational requirements for clearing members and minimum margin requirements for our cleared products our clearing houses use software based on industry standard margining conventions and on our proprietary models uniquely customized to our products to determine the appropriate margin requirements for each clearing member by simulating the possible gains and losses of complex portfolios based on price movements 

in the event of a payment default by a member the default procedures specified in the rules of that clearing house would apply in general the clearing houses would first apply assets of the defaulting member to cover the obligation these include originalinitial margin variation margin positions held at the clearing house and guaranty fund deposits of the clearing member in addition the clearing houses could make a demand for payment pursuant to any available guarantee provided by the parent or affiliate of the defaulting clearing member if that is not sufficient the clearing houses would use any designated contributions held by the clearing 

house itself as applicable the guaranty fund contributions of other members and funds collected through an assessment against all other nondefaulting members to satisfy the remaining deficit if any as part of the powers and procedures designed to backstop financial obligations in the event of a default each of our clearing houses may levy assessments on all of its clearing members if there are insufficient funds available to cover a deficit following the depletion of all assets in the guaranty fund 

our risk management framework that applies to the clearing services for the cds markets through ice clear europe is separate from that of our futures and options or noncds clearing operations we also offer clearing services for cds markets through ice clear credit we have established separate cds risk pools for ice clear credit and ice clear europe including separate guaranty funds and margin accounts meaning that the cds positions are not combined with positions in our futures and options clearing houses the cds clearing houses have risk management systems that are designed specifically for cds instruments and have independent governance structures both cds clearing houses are openaccess pursuant to regulatory requirements and therefore accept qualifying trades for clearing that are executed on other venues as of december 31 2015 our cds clearing houses clear 431 single name instruments and 129 cds indexes 

we have historically committed 303 million in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility to assist our clearing houses with liquidity that may be needed to both operate and manage a default during a time of financial stress as of december 31 2015 we no longer reserve any of our revolving credit facility for use by our clearing houses for liquidity purposes and instead increased our contribution to restricted cash at our clearing houses see item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources in this annual report 

our clearing houses require that each clearing member make deposits to the guaranty fund the amounts in the guaranty fund will serve to secure the obligations of a clearing member to our clearing houses and may be used to cover losses in excess of the margin and clearing firm accounts sustained by our clearing houses in the event of a default of a clearing member as of december 31 2015  we have made combined contributions to our clearing houses guaranty funds of 250 million  ice clear europe has contributed 100 million  of its own cash as part of its futures and options guaranty fund as of december 31 2015  and has also contributed 50 million  of its own cash as part of its cds guaranty fund as of december 31 2015  ice clear credit has contributed 50 million  of its own cash as part of its cds guaranty fund as of december 31 2015  and ice clear us has contributed 50 million  of its own cash as part of its futures and options guaranty fund as of december 31 2015  each of these amounts are reflected as longterm restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet 

the financial stability oversight council or fsoc has designated ice clear credit as a systemically important financial market utility under title viii of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the doddfrank act as such ice clear credit has access to the federal reserve system and currently holds deposits in excess of 8 billion of its us dollar cash in its cash account at the federal reserve 

to provide a tool to address the liquidity needs of the clearing house and manage the liquidation of margin and guaranty fund deposits held in the form of high quality sovereign debt ice clear europe ice clear credit and ice clear us have entered into committed repurchase agreement facilities or committed repo as of december 31 2015  ice clear europe had 10 billion in committed repo ice clear credit had 500 million in committed repo and ice clear us had 250 million in committed repo the ice clear europe committed repo is available in us dollars euro and pound sterling the ice clear credit committed repo is available in us dollars and euro and the ice clear us committed repo is available in us dollars the committed repo arrangements provide these three clearing houses with an additional liquidity tool that may be utilized in the event there is a need to convert high quality sovereign debt into cash on a sameday basis during a market disruption that makes it difficult to sell and settle such sovereign debt on a sameday basis

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect us in the future if any of the risks discussed below actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected accordingly you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this annual report 

impact of financial markets volatility including the prices and interest rates underlying our derivative products 

trading volume in our markets and products is largely driven by the degree of volatility  the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations  in prices and levels of the underlying commodities securities indices financial benchmarks or other instruments 

volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates opportunities for speculative or arbitrage trading were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices or levels of the underlying commodities securities indices benchmarks or other instruments of our products we could experience lower trading volumes slower growth or declines in revenues 

factors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility and thus trading volumes include 

 any one or more of these factors may reduce trading activity which could make our markets less attractive as a source of liquidity and in turn could further discourage existing and potential market participants and thus accelerate a decline in the level of trading activity and potentially related services such as data or clearing further most of these factors are beyond our control if any of these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets could be jeopardized because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our current products and services decline for any reason we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues and our net income will decline 

global financial markets conditions and new laws and regulations 

the conditions in global financial markets will impact our business if our customers reduce spending workforce trading activity or demand for financial data as a result of challenges in the financial markets our revenues will decline a significant portion of our revenues are derived from fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets we derived 56 61 and 79 of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses from our transactionbased business in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively in particular we derive a significant percentage of the consolidated revenues from our transactionbased business from trading in ice brent crude futures and options contracts north american natural gas futures and options contracts sugar futures and options contracts equity transactions and short term interest rates contracts including the euribor and short sterling futures and options contracts the trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of trading activity for any reason including the factors referenced above that impact volatility such as 

 a reduction in our overall trading volume could also render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenues a reduction in trading volumes would also likely result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for our market data that would further reduce our overall revenue 

our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to increased legislation and regulatory scrutiny and we face the risk of changes to this regulatory environment and business in the future 

we are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in many jurisdictions around the world and in particular in the us and the uk where the largest portions of our operations are conducted we face the risk of significant actions by regulatory 

and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments that may affect our business the activity of our market participants and as a consequence our results among other things as a result of regulators enforcing existing laws and regulations we could be censured fined prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees in many cases our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions 

there is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could be imposed which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or which may impact our clients’ overall trading volume through our exchanges and demand for our market data and other services in addition regulation imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally such as the proposed proprietary trading restrictions for certain banking organizations in both the us and europe could adversely impact levels of market activity and price volatility more broadly and thus impact our businesses 

these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our stockholders and creditors in addition certain developments could increase our liability for performing our oversight requirements 

us and european legal and regulatory developments in response to the global financial crisis in particular the doddfrank act emir and mifid ii have significantly altered and propose to further alter the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability among the aspects of these recently enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes most likely to affect our businesses are position limit rules in the us and europe nondiscriminatory access provisions of mifid ii capital charges in basel iii including the supplemental leverage ratio the harmonization of margin provisions the recognition of our businesses in foreign jurisdictions implementation of a financial transaction tax access to our benchmarks monitoring of automated trading under regulation at and maintaining our exchanges abilities to operate as sros with related immunity for the discharge of their regulatory functions as the operator of global businesses the lack of harmonization in international financial reform efforts could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in multiple jurisdictions 

the doddfrank act established enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the fsoc ice clear credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the fsoc and as a result is subject to additional oversight by the cftc 

other enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability see item 1  business  regulation” above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations 

systems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry could negatively impact us 

highprofile system failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry like the one we suffered at nyse on july 8 2015 could negatively impact our business regulators have imposed new requirements for trading platforms that have been costly for us to implement or that could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services in particular the secs regulation systems compliance and integrity or regulation sci subjects portions of our securities trading platforms and other technological systems to more extensive regulation and oversight ensuring our compliance with the requirements of regulation sci for this portion of our platforms and systems requires significant implementation costs as well as increased ongoing administrative expenses and burdens if system failures in the industry continue to occur it is also possible that investor confidence in the trading industry could diminish leading to decreased trading volume and revenue whether or not any of our own systems experience material failures any of these developments could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we face intense competition 

we face intense competition in all aspects of our business and our competitors both domestic and international are numerous we currently compete with 

 21 

 trends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings finally many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and alternative trading system businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business 

a decline in our fees due to competitive pressure the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability for example interactive datas business has benefited from a high renewal rate in its subscription based business but we cannot assure you that this will continue we also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers if we are not able to compete successfully our business could be materially impacted including our ability to sustain as an operating entity 

in our listings business the legal and regulatory environment in the us and the market perceptions about that environment may make it difficult for our us equity exchanges to compete with nonus equity exchanges for listings for example negative perceptions regarding compliance costs associated with adherence to corporate governance requirements have and may continue to discourage listings on us equity exchanges by both us and foreign private issuers any failure by our exchanges to successfully compete for any reason could adversely impact our revenue derived from listing fees and the associated trading execution and market data fees 

we may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our recent acquisitions and future acquisitions which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we have completed many acquisitions and plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures when we deem it appropriate recently we completed the acquisition of the following companies 

 the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to integrate these businesses into our existing operations and realize anticipated cost savings revenue synergies and growth opportunities we expect to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies we generally set aggressive timelines for realizing savings   which assumes we successfully undertake a variety of actions including but not limited to integrating technology eliminating redundancies and effecting organizational restructurings that are themselves subject to a variety of risks and may be subject to regulatory approvals that we do not control with respect to interactive data we expect to achieve 150 million in annual cost synergies with 90 of these synergies expected to be achieved exiting 2018 there is a risk however that we may not integrate these acquired companies in a manner that permits our expected cost savings and revenue synergies to be fully realized in the time periods expected or at all in addition a variety of factors including but not limited to regulatory conditions governmental competition approvals currency fluctuations and difficulty integrating technology platforms may adversely affect our anticipated cost savings and synergies for example the competition and markets authority in the uk is currently reviewing our acquisition of trayport under the merger control laws of the uk this review could force us to take certain actions that may result in us not realizing the benefits of the acquisition at all 

the process of integration may disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties including inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants regulators and others require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business as a result we may not achieve the integration objectives cost savings revenue growth and synergies in full or at all or it may take longer to realize them than expected for any particular merger or acquisition 

we may also not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures or alliances that we have entered into or may enter into for a number of reasons including regulatory or government approvals or changes global market changes contractual obligations competing products and in some instances our lack of or limited control over the management of the business further strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future 

we continue to look for strategic growth opportunities in line with our business strategy and will pursue acquisitions when we believe that they are in our best interests we may be very acquisitive as a result of any future acquisition we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest expend cash incur debt assume actual and contingent liabilities inherit existing or pending litigation or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets further we cannot assure you that any such financing or equity investments will be available with terms that will be favorable to us or available at all 

owning clearing houses exposes us to risks including risk related to defaults by clearing members risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses 

there are risks inherent in operating a clearing house including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members defaults by clearing members and risks associated with investing collateral provided by clearing members to our clearing houses which could subject our business to substantial losses for example clearing members have placed an aggregate amount of cash in ice clear europe relating to margin requirements and funding the guaranty funds of 310 billion as of december 31 2015 and a total of 512 billion for all of our clearing houses as of december 31 2015 ice clear europe and ice clear us use third party investment managers for investment activity of their clearing members cash deposits and may add or change the investment managers from time to time ice clear credit currently selfmanages the majority of the cash that its clearing members leave on deposit to satisfy their respective original margin and guaranty fund requirements ice clear credit uses external investment managers to invest the remainder of their clearing members cash deposits 

we have an obligation to return margin payments and guaranty fund contributions to clearing members once the relevant member’s exposure to the clearing house no longer exists if the number of large wellcapitalized banks that are clearing members decreases the concentration of risks within our clearing houses will be spread among a smaller pool of clearing members which makes it more difficult to absorb and manage risk in the event of a clearing members default 

although our clearing houses have policies and procedures to help ensure that clearing members can satisfy their obligations such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a member or a counterparty’s default in addition although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards it is a complex process and there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect us from the risks of clearing these products we cannot assure you that these measures and safeguards will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default we have contributed our own capital to the guaranty fund of the clearing houses that could be used in the event of a default furthermore the default of any one of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and cause our customers to lose confidence in the guarantee of our clearing houses 

a decline in the value of securities held as collateral by our clearing houses or default by a sovereign government issuer could pose additional risks of default by clearing members 

our clearing houses hold a substantial amount of assets as collateral which comprise us and other sovereign treasury securities as of december 31 2015 our clearing houses held 357 billion of noncash collateral in us and other sovereign treasury securities 258 billion of this amount was comprised of us treasury securities 20 billion of uk treasury securities 16 billion of french treasury securities 770 million of german treasury securities 719 million of italian treasury securities and 48 billion of other european japanese and triparty treasury securities sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest and most liquid securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived credit worthiness of major governments although the markets for such securities have experienced significant volatility during the past decade the markets for such treasury securities have experienced significant volatility recently related to ongoing financial challenges in some of the major european countries and leading up to the us government’s negotiations regarding tax increases spending cuts and raising 

the debt ceiling which is the maximum amount of debt that the us government can legally incur in addition if there is a collapse of the euro our clearing houses would face significant expenses in changing their systems and such an event could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates to mitigate this risk our clearing houses currently apply a discount or haircut to the market values for all sovereign securities held as collateral however market conditions could change more quickly than we adjust the amount of the haircuts and the haircuts could be insufficient in the event of a sudden market event 

notwithstanding the current intraday margin and valuation checks conducted by our clearing houses and our policies and practices to limit exposures our clearing houses will need to continue to monitor the volatility and value of us and other sovereign treasury securities because if the value of these securities declines significantly our clearing houses will need to collect additional collateral from their clearing members which may be difficult for the members to supply in a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government in addition our clearing houses may be required to impose a more significant discount on the value of sovereign treasury securities posted as collateral if there is uncertainty regarding the future value of these securities which would trigger the need for additional collateral contributions by the clearing members if a clearing member cannot supply the additional collateral which may include cash deposits in a currency acceptable to the clearing house the clearing house would deem the clearing member in default if any clearing members default as a result of the reduction in value of their collateral our clearing houses and trading business could suffer substantial losses as a result of the loss of our own capital that has been contributed to the clearing house’s guaranty fund and a loss of confidence by clearing members in the guaranty of the clearing house resulting in a reduction in volumes of future cleared transactions 

further our clearing houses invest large sums through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and may hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions our clearing houses may also make time deposits with banks that are secured only to the value of fdic insurance which is small and therefore our deposits may in significant part be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent 

owning and operating equity exchanges exposes us to additional risks including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject 

owning and operating equity exchanges exposes us to additional risks their revenues are primarily derived from market data listing fees and trading activity adverse economic conditions and regulatory changes similar to those discussed above could result in decreased trading volume discourage market participants from listing on our equity exchanges or cause them to forgo new offerings any of these could reduce our revenues including market data revenue 

our exchanges are operated as forprofit businesses but have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled specifically our exchanges are responsible for enforcing listed company compliance with applicable listing standards overseeing regulatory policy determinations rule interpretation and regulationrelated rule development and conducting trading reviews any failure by one of our exchanges with selfregulatory responsibility to comply with and enforce compliance by their members with exchange rules and securities laws could significantly harm our reputation prompt regulatory scrutiny and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we must allocate significant resources to fulfill our selfregulatory responsibilities the forprofit exchanges goal of maximizing stockholder value might contradict the exchanges selfregulatory responsibilities the listing of our common stock on the nyse could potentially create a conflict between the exchange’s regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities on the one hand and our commercial and economic interest on the other hand while we have structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful 

we may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities 

we intend to launch new products and continue to explore and pursue other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may spend substantial time and money developing new product offerings or improving current product offerings if these offerings are not successful we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to recover the costs of such initiatives obtaining any required regulatory approval associated with these offerings may also result in delays or restrictions on our ability to fully benefit from these offerings further we may enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry attracting customers in certain countries may also be subject to a number of risks including currency exchange rate risk difficulties in enforcing agreements or collecting receivables longer payment cycles compliance with the laws or regulations of these countries and political and regulatory uncertainties 

in addition in light of consolidation in the exchange data services and clearing sectors and competition for opportunities we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully 

our competitors could merge making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors also offering new products and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives that are necessary for our success 

we have made substantial progress toward developing and deploying new technology platforms to improve our equity exchange business and data services business we may experience disruptions or encounter unexpected challenges in deploying these new systems further the costs to complete the remaining work may exceed our current expectations for those costs any significant cost increases or disruptions to product quality sales effectiveness or client service or to our other business operations could have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations 

our compliance and risk management methods as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations might not be effective 

our ability to comply with complex and changing laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel while we have policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks and regulatory obligations we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed regulators periodically review our exchanges’ ability to selfregulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including selfregulatory standards in particular certain of our businesses acquired in the nyse acquisition are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations policies and procedures if we fail to comply with any of these obligations regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business 

our recent acquisition of interactive data exposes us to new regulatory requirements specifically interactive data pricing and reference data llc or prd llc one of its subsidiaries is a registered investment adviser with the sec with respect to its evaluated pricing services and is subject to significant regulatory obligations under the investment advisers act of 1940 or investment advisers act none of our other businesses or subsidiaries are registered under the investment advisers act compliance with the investment advisers act and other regulatory requirements gives rise to costs and expenses and we cannot assure you that our systems and procedures are fully effective 

our regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses for example we have paid a 5 million penalty to the sec in 2014 and a 3 million penalty to the cftc in 2015 as a result of enforcement actions brought by these regulators we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity further the implementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to remain competitive and grow our business 

in the case of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations proceedings and regulatory enforcement actions that may result in substantial penalties settlements or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which could be significant any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to continue to conduct our business 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill other intangible assets or investments 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2015 we had goodwill of 121 billion and net other intangible assets of 108 billion relating to our acquisitions our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties and the russell licensing agreement as of december 31 2015 we also have 299 million in longterm investments relating to our equity security investment in cetip sa or cetip we recorded a 190 million impairment loss on our investment in cetip during 2013 primarily due to the devaluation of the brazilian real further cds trade execution revenues at creditex have decreased over the last several years as trading volumes in the global cds market have declined and cds trading remains muted due to financial reform implementation and lower volatility in corporate credit markets as of december 31 2015 the creditex customer relationship intangible asset had a remaining net book value of 61 million and will become fully amortized in august 2020 based on the most recent recoverability test performed the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the asset by 8 we continue to monitor potential triggering events in our cds trade execution business that could result in further testing for recoverability and if it was determined that the carrying value of the asset was not recoverable an impairment of the asset would then be recorded 

we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may result in asset impairments an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill other intangible assets and other investments and assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 

for additional information on our goodwill other intangible assets and investments including impairment refer to notes 5 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements and “ critical accounting policies  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets” in item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are included in this annual report 

if we are unable to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences we may not be able to compete effectively 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary and acquired technology the financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change change in use patterns change in client preferences frequent product and service introductions and the emergence of new industry standards and practices these changes could render our existing proprietary technology uncompetitive or obsolete 

further we use some opensource software in our technology most often as small components within a larger product or service to augment algorithms functionalities or libraries we create and we may use more opensource software in the future opensource code is also contained in some thirdparty software we rely on we could be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of the license for such opensource software the terms of many opensource licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us or other courts and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology to our clients’ requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and costeffective manner any failure to remain abreast of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to client preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our revenues 

our business may be harmed by computer and communications systems failures and delays 

we support and maintain many of the systems that comprise our electronic platforms our failure to monitor or maintain these systems or to find replacements for defective components within a system in a timely and costeffective manner when necessary could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business our customers rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate and highquality financial market data analytics and related solutions our timely reliable delivery of highquality products and services is subject to an array of technical production processes that enable our delivery platforms to leverage an extensive range of content databases our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

 we could experience system failures due to power or telecommunications failures human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyber attacks intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar events if any one or more of these situations were to arise they could result in damage to our business reputation and participant dissatisfaction with our electronic platform which could prompt participants to trade elsewhere or expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions as a consequence our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

our regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in volume of order and trading transaction traffic and to provide processing and clearing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

our systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks hacking and cyber attacks especially in light of our role in the global financial marketplace which could result in wrongful use of our information or which could make our participants reluctant to use our electronic platform 

the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to reliably transact on our electronic platforms and provide financial data services are critical elements of our operations some of our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential client data including client portfolio information if anyone gains improper access to our electronic platforms networks or databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify our confidential information or that of a third party our networks and those of our participants third party service providers and external market infrastructures may be vulnerable to compromise security technology failure social engineering denial of service attacks or other security failures resulting in loss of data integrity information disclosure unavailability or fraud recently the financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of political protest activism and fraud further former employees of certain companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly 

although we have not been the victim of cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cyber security events including distributed denial of service attacks malware infections phishing web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size though it did not result in a material impact we experienced a distributed denial of service attack on our website in october 2014 that temporarily disrupted inbound internet traffic and was reportable to regulatory authorities we operate an information security program that is designed to prevent detect track and mitigate cyber incidents and that has detected and mitigated such incidents in the past although we intend to implement additional industry standard security measures in the future to the extent necessary to maintain the effectiveness of our information security program we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against attacks losses or reduced trading volume in our markets as a result of any security breach hacking or cyberattack any such attacks could result in reputational damage cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose customers cause us to experience lower current and future trading volumes or incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive position additionally current and future security measures may involve significant costs to purchase and maintain which could adversely impact our net income 

we currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness 

following our acquisition of nyse and interactive data we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis as of december 31 2015 we had 73 billion of outstanding debt this level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities as we use our available resources to reduce and refinance our consolidated debt our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue future business opportunities may be further restrained in addition the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio test and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other matters 

our longterm debt is currently rated by moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s these ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time and it is 

possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade our credit ratings in the future in particular our inability to sustain reduced debt on a consolidated basis may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings in addition a significant downgrade of our credit rating could impact the regulatory status of our clearing houses and make parties less willing to do business with our clearing houses and exchanges and could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase the cost of any future debt funding we may obtain 

damage to our reputation resulting from our administration of libor could adversely affect our business 

our subsidiary iba is the administrator for various benchmarks including libor ibas administration of libor is the result of the libor scandal which was a series of fraudulent actions taken by banks that were submitting false libor rates to profit from trades or to give the impression that the banks were more creditworthy than they were any failures or negative publicity resulting from our administration of libor or other benchmarks could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and could harm our reputation 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

since we conduct operations in several different countries including the us uk continental europe and canada substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling euros and canadian dollars because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

the european debt crisis and related european financial restructuring efforts have contributed to instability in global credit markets and resulted in a decline in the value of the pounds sterling and euro relative to the us dollar if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the uk continental europe the us or other key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further the value of the pounds sterling and euro and the global credit markets may further weaken general financial instability in countries in the european union including greece could have a contagion effect on the region and contribute to the general instability and uncertainty in the european union events that adversely affect our uk and continental european clients and suppliers could in turn have a materially adverse effect on our international business results and our results of operations 

for additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk refer to “ foreign currency exchange rate risk” in item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk which are included in this annual report 

owning and operating voice broker businesses exposes us to additional risk and these businesses are largely dependent on their brokerdealer clients 

our voice broker business is primarily transactionbased and it provides brokerage services to clients primarily in the form of agency transactions although it also engages in a limited number of matched principal transactions in agency transactions customers pay transaction fees for trade execution services in which we connect buyers and sellers who settle their transactions directly in matched principal transactions also known as “riskless principal” transactions we agree to buy instruments from one customer and sell them to another customer the amount of the fee generally depends on the spread between the buy and sell price of the security that is brokered the majority of transactions by creditex and creditex brokerage which are the subsidiaries that engage in our voice broker business are agency transactions and the matched principal transactions accounted for 40 of the total transactions for creditex and creditex brokerage for the year ended december 31 2015 with respect to matched principal transactions a counterparty to a matched principal transaction may fail to fulfill its obligations or creditex or creditex brokerage may face liability for an unmatched trade declines in trading volumes in credit derivatives would adversely affect the revenues we derive from creditex we also face the risk of not being able to collect transaction or processing fees charged to customers for brokerage services and processing services we provide 

we may face liability for content contained in our data products and services 

we may be subject to claims for breach of contract defamation libel copyright or trademark infringement fraud or negligence or based on other theories of liability in each case relating to the data articles commentary ratings information or other content we distribute in our financial data services if such data or other content or information that we distribute has errors is delayed or has design defects we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our corporate website or those websites that we own and operate through links to other websites use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for significant amounts any such claim even if the outcome were 

to be ultimately favorable to us could involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we license and redistribute data and content from various third parties our data and content suppliers may audit our use and our clients use and payment for data and content and may assert that we or our clients owe additional amounts under the terms of the license agreements or that we or our clients used the data or content in a manner that exceeded the scope of the license agreement we may incur costs to investigate any such allegations and we may be required to make unexpected payments to these data and content suppliers 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties including trademarks service marks trade names trade secrets copyrights and patents we cannot assure you that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property additionally we may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property our failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively further we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights which may require significant financial and managerial resources as a result we may choose not to enforce our infringed intellectual property rights depending on our strategic evaluation and judgment regarding the best use of our resources the relative strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the recourse available to us 

in addition our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may have obtained and may be expected to obtain in the future patent rights related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services as a result we may face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the holders of the patents or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patents we also could be required to pay damages if we were found to infringe patents held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we rely on third party providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of an important service data or content supplied by any third party or the loss of an exclusive license could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as online service providers hosting service and software providers data processors software and hardware vendors banks local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading clearing data services and other systems we rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with third parties and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for the provision of hosting services we also depend on thirdparty suppliers for data and content including data received from certain competitors clients various government and public record services and financial institutions used in our products and services some of this data is exclusive to particular suppliers and may not be obtained from other suppliers in addition our data suppliers could enter into exclusive contracts with our competitors without our knowledge the general trend toward industry consolidation may increase the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future if these companies were to discontinue providing services to us for any reason or fail to provide the type of service agreed to we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients or increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines our third party data suppliers perform audits on us from time to time in the ordinary course of business to determine if data we license for redistribution has been properly accounted for in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreement as a result of these audits we may incur additional expenses 

many of our clients also rely on third parties to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform if these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients’ inability to transact with our businesses we hold exclusive licenses to list various index futures and contracts in the future litigation or regulatory action may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and contracts trading to a single exchange and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or 

jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license mifid ii introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of services relating to commodity derivatives across europe and the legislation requires open access to any benchmarks a benchmark is an index or other measure used to determine the value of a financial instrument for example libor or the sp 500 used in europe if unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive license were permitted we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products 

we are subject to significant litigation and liability risks 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our participants involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred for example dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platform or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades abusive trading practices security and confidentiality breaches mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants in addition because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by entering them inaccurately a large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets in addition we are subject to various legal disputes some of which we are involved in due to acquisition activity we could incur significant expenses defending claims even those without merit which could adversely affect our financing condition and operating results an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for a summary of our legal proceedings and claims 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

given our prominence in the global securities industry and the location of many of our properties and personnel in us and european financial centers including lower manhattan we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees in addition terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets including trading on exchanges any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt is dividends from our subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock further we have guaranteed the payment of certain obligations by our subsidiary nyse holdings llc this guarantee may require us to provide substantial funds or assets to creditors of our subsidiaries at a time when we are in need of liquidity to fund our own obligations and may affect our ability to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock 

provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ice 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for ice these provisions make a change of control less likely which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of us and european equity exchanges for example our organizational documents include provisions that generally restrict any person either alone or together with its related persons from i voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10 of our outstanding voting capital stock including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock or ii beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the 

outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock further our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to call special stockholders’ meetings or act by written consent and generally authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock in addition provisions of delaware law may have a similar effect such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders as defined under delaware law from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the board of directors

dividends 

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our future earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness credit ratings and other considerations our board of directors deem relevant our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board or audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio during the year ended december 31 2015 we paid dividends of 290 per share of our common stock in the aggregate including a quarterly dividend for the first quarter of 2015 of 065 per share and quarterly dividends for the next three quarters of 2015 of 075 per share for an aggregate payout of 331 million in 2015 which includes the

as a holding company we have no operations and rely upon dividends from our subsidiaries in order to provide liquidity necessary to service our debt obligations and make dividend payments to our shareholders we and our subsidiaries are all required to comply with legal and regulatory restrictions including restrictions contained in applicable general corporate laws regarding the declaration and payment of dividends these laws may limit our or our subsidiaries’ ability to declare and pay dividends from time to time 

none of the indentures governing our and our subsidiaries’ outstanding indebtedness contain specific covenants restricting our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends absent a default on such indebtedness our senior unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate amount of 34 billion however limits our ability to declare and make dividend payments and other distributions of our cash property or assets if a default under the applicable facility has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a result of our declaration and payment of any dividend or other distribution our senior unsecured revolving credit facility contains customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on our operations including our maintenance of specified total leverage and interest coverage ratios which could indirectly affect our ability to pay dividends refer to note 9 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for more information on our debt facilities

 factors affecting our results and business and market trends 

the business environments in which we operate directly affect our results of operations our results have been and will continue to be affected by many factors including market volatility and the level of trading activity in our markets which during any period is significantly influenced by general market conditions legislative and regulatory changes as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations competition demand for our data services and our market share our system reliability our ability to offer new products our acquisition activities and the pace of industry consolidation broad trends in the data and finance industry the number and financial health of companies listed on our cash markets geopolitical events real and perceived supply and demand imbalances changing technology in the financial services industry and our reputation among other factors in particular in recent years the business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings the globalization of exchanges customers and competitors market participants’ demand for speed capacity and reliability which requires continuing investment in technology and increasing competition for market data revenues price volatility increases the need to hedge risk and creates demand among market participants for the exchange of risk market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market’s strength the maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing 

the implementation of new regulations may impact participation in our markets many of the proposed changes with regard to global financial reform are still being determined and have yet to be implemented in europe final regulations have not yet been adopted and significant uncertainties and ambiguities remain around such regulations as this is established legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data as a result it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us however it may possibly result in increased costs and the expenditure of significant 

resources as discussed more fully in item 1 “ business  regulation” included elsewhere in this annual report the implementation of mifid ii and its counterpart emir may result in operational regulatory andor business risk 

low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a slow global economic recovery equity market indices became increasingly volatile in the second half of 2015 economic uncertainty in the asia and the european union may also continue to negatively affect global financial markets in addition economic uncertainty has continued to affect our clients’ activities business models and investment over the last several years we expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our businesses we have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility trading activity or participation in any one asset class in addition we have increased our portion of nontransaction and clearing revenues from 13 in 2012 to 44 in 2015 this nontransaction revenue includes data and listings and will continue to increase as a percent of our total revenue with the addition of interactive data and trayport revenues reflected in our full year results we continue to focus on our strategy to grow our revenue streams as well as on our companywide expense reduction initiatives in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties 

in recent years financial institutions globally have acted to control or reduce spending including spending on financial information and related services yet many of the data products and services we sell are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels while we expect that cost reduction and cost containment pressures will continue we anticipate that there will be overall growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends including the following increasing us and global regulatory demands investor demands for transparency greater use of fair value accounting standards greater emphasis on risk management market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes the move to passive investing and indexation ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets increased electronification of fixed income markets and increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions we contract with clients through data fixedfee subscriptions on either a multiyear annual quarterly or monthly basis variable fees based on usage or a combination of fixedfee subscription and usagebased fees in addition some of our data services generate onetime or nonrecurring revenue such as onetime purchases of historical data setup services or implementation fees 

interactive datas pricing and reference data business grew in 2015 primarily due to expansion in north america and europe growth was driven by strong revenue retention rates increased demand from existing clients and to a lesser extent new clients contributions from recently launched products and the effect of price increases quarterly revenue retention rates for the pricing and reference data business which is calculated as 100 less the dollar magnitude of cancellations including revenue declines from continuing customers related to service downgrades renegotiations price reductions and usage declines received during the prior 12 months divided by the annualized quarterly revenue at the beginning of that same 12month period have averaged 94 since 2007 and were 95 for 2015 

revenues 

total revenues less transactionbased expenses exclude revenues related to discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2015 december 31 2014 and 2013 see “ discontinued operations” below the following table presents our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses from continuing operations dollars in millions 



transaction and clearing fees 

our transaction and clearing fees are reported on a net basis except for the transactionbased expenses discussed below and consist of fees collected from our derivatives trading and clearing and from our us cash trading and equity options businesses in our derivatives markets we earn transaction and clearing fees from both counterparties to each contract that is traded andor cleared we receive transaction fee revenues from us equity and equity options markets through the new york stock exchange nyse arca nyse mkt nyse amex options and nyse arca options including routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution 

revenues percontract are driven by the number of trades executed and fees charged per contract net of certain rebates the amount of our percontract transaction and clearing fees will depend upon many factors including but not limited to market conditions transaction and clearing volume pricing applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements product mix and new product introductions because transaction and clearing fees are assessed on a percontract or notional value basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume but not to the same degree due to product mix and pricing see “ factors affecting our results” above 

in 2015  ice brent crude futures and options contracts produced the nineteenth consecutive year of record volume the brent crude futures contract is relied upon by a broad range of global market participants including oil producing nations and multinational companies to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption brent crude futures and options volume increased 14 for year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  primarily due to increased volatility in oil prices following price declines and the continuing uncertainty around supply demand and storage based on traded volume in our brent and wti crude futures contracts we had 49 54 and 55 market share of the global crude futures contracts volume for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively while total oil volume and revenues increased during 2015 

global crude market share declined due to greater volatility in wti crude oil prices relative to brent crude oil prices which drove more trading by noncommercial firms in wti 

we receive transaction and clearing fee revenues from executing and clearing trades on european interest rate futures and options and additional agriculture and equity derivatives futures and options trading volume in european interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility resulting from expectations for changes in the level and term structure of shortterm interest rates and in economic data and trading in equity derivatives including equity indexes and single stock futures is primarily driven by volatility interest rate futures and options volume decreased 11 for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  primarily due to the low interest rate environment and the associated low volatility of the prevailing zerointerest rate policy in the european union 

natural gas revenue increased 3 and volume declined 4 for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  and natural gas revenue declined 6 and volume declined 22 for the year ended december 31 2014  from the comparable period in 2013  the revenue increase in 2015 and the relatively lower decrease in revenue in 2014 compared to the volume decreases was driven by growth in european natural gas volume which has a higher transaction fee as compared to the north american natural gas contract where volume declined year over year decreased north american natural gas volume was primarily due to continued low volatility and low price levels which produced muted trading activity in comparison to the year ended december 31 2013 in addition moderate commodity demand due to muted economic growth regulatory uncertainty and strong natural gas supply reduced the demand for trading and hedging during 2015 and 2014 

ice gasoil is a key refined oil products benchmark in europe and asia which completed its transition to a new gasoil specification in january 2015 gasoil futures and options volumes increased 19 for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  and decreased 17 for the year ended december 31 2014 from the comparable period in 2013  the increase in volume during the year ended december 31 2015  is primarily due to greater price volatility associated with oil price volatility and following the transition to the low sulphur gasoil specification the transition to the new gasoil specification helped contribute to the lower gasoil volumes during the year ended december 31 2014 

other oil revenue and volume grew during the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  primarily due to oil price volatility and the introduction of new oil products as well as the increased use of clearing related to regulatory requirements 

sugar revenue and volume grew during the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  primarily due to price volatility and currency volatility in key currencies price volatility was driven by prospects for a bigger than expected shortfall of sugar production after several seasons of surplus also forecast for a stronger than expected el nino impact are generating uncertainty over sugar production estimates

cds trade execution revenues at creditex and ice swap trade were 49 million 64 million and 66 million for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the notional value of the underlying cds traded was 8677 billion 10 trillion and 9044 billion for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively cds trading remains muted due to financial reform implementation and lower volatility in corporate credit markets 

us cash equities handled volume increased 14 for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  primarily due to an increase in the total consolidated equities volume and an increase in our market share for the year ended december 31 2015  us cash equities revenues net of transactionbased expenses were 220 million for the year ended december 31 2015 an increase of 17 from net us cash equities revenues of 188 million for the year ended december 31 2014

our transaction and clearing fees are presented net of rebates we recorded rebates of 563 million 466 million and 497 million for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded the increase in the rebates is due primarily to the rebates relating to the addition of european interest rate derivatives markets following the nyse acquisition an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts and an increase in the number of rebate programs the level of rebates as a percentage of our total transaction and clearing fees has remained relatively consistent for the past several years

listing fees 

we recognize listing fee revenues in our securities markets from two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our us cash equities exchanges  original listing fees and annual listing fees original listing fees consist of two components initial listing fees and fees related to other corporaterelated actions initial listing fees subject to a minimum and maximum amount are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists initial listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straightline basis over estimated service periods of nine years for nyse and five years for nyse arca and nyse mkt annual fees are charged based on the number of outstanding shares of listed us companies at the end of the prior year nonus companies pay fees based on the number of listed securities issued or held in the us annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year

we determined that at the time of our acquisition of nyse we did not have a legal performance obligation relating to these listing fees therefore in connection with purchase accounting and in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or us gaap we assigned a fair value of zero to the nyse unamortized deferred revenue balances relating to the listing fees as of the acquisition date of november 13 2013 the historical original listing fees deferred revenue balance as of that date was 486 million the listing fees unamortized deferred revenue balance as of december 31 2015  of 109 million relates to original and other corporate action listing fees incurred and billed and not yet recognized as revenue subsequent to the november 13 2013 acquisition through december 31 2015 listing fees revenues exclude euronext listing fee revenues which are included in income from discontinued operations see “ discontinued operations” below

interest expense increased for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily due to 9 million in interest expense that we recognized relating to new debt we incurred for the interactive data acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2015 this increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2015 was offset due to the repayment of 10 billion in nyse eur notes on june 30 2015 the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2014 from the comparable period in 2013 is primarily due to an increase in the overall amount of debt outstanding relating to debt incurred for and from the nyse acquisition see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our outstanding debt and debt facilities 

in october 2013 following the issuance of 14 billion in senior notes we prepaid our outstanding private senior notes representing 400 million aggregate principal amount in connection with the early payoff of the private senior notes we incurred 51 million in expenses which was recorded as other expense during the year ended december 31 2013

for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100 and for which we have control over the assets liabilities and management of the entity the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as noncontrolling interests as of december 31 2012 noncontrolling interest related to the operating results of our cds clearing subsidiaries in which nonice limited partners held a 455 net profit sharing interest during the year ended december 31 2013 we purchased 3 of the net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries from various nonice limited partners and the remaining nonice limited partners currently hold a 425 net profit sharing interest in connection with our 79 acquisition of the ice endex in march 2013 gasunie’s 21 ownership is included in the noncontrolling interest line subsequent to the acquisition date in connection with our 75 acquisition of ice clear netherlands in december 2014 abn amro clearing bank nv’s 25 ownership is included in the noncontrolling interest line subsequent to the acquisition date in connection with our acquisition of nyse we had noncontrolling interest related to various minority ownership interests held in our majority owned subsidiary nyse amex options during the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 we repurchased the remaining ownership of nyse amex options from the minority owners effective from july 1 2015 all of the profits from nyse amex options are retained by us as we now own 100 of nyse amex options see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere is this annual report for additional information on nyse amex options 

the decrease in the net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the year ended december 31 2015  from the comparable period in 2014  is primarily due to a decrease in the net income relating to the nyse amex options minority ownership interest primarily due to the reduction in the minority ownership percentage the increase in the net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the year ended december 31 2014  from the comparable period in 2013  is primarily related to these new noncontrolling interests discussed above and increases in cds clearing revenues 

income tax provision 

consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations was 358 million  402 million  and 184 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the change in our pretax income and the change in our effective tax rate each year our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 22  29  and 37  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 are lower than the statutory federal rate primarily due to favorable foreign tax rate differentials partially offset by state income taxes favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower tax rates in the uk the netherlands and various other lower tax jurisdictions than compared to the tax rates in the us during the fourth quarter of 2015 the uk reduced the corporate income tax rate from 20 to 19 effective april 1 2017 and to 18 effective april 1 2020 the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the year ended december 31 2014 is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future uk income tax rate reductions along with certain favorable settlements with various taxing authorities the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 is higher than the statutory federal rate primarily due to the favorable foreign income tax rate differential being largely offset by the nontax deductible impairment loss on the cetip investment along with state income taxes see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere is this annual report for additional information on these tax items 

discontinued operations 

due to the sale of a controlling interest in euronext and the sales of the three companies comprising nyse technologies nyfix metabit and wombat we deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of euronext as of the june 24 2014 ipo date and nyse technologies as of the various sales dates and included the financial results of these entities in discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements effective from the nyse acquisition date of november 13 2013 there was no gain or loss recognized on the euronext ipo or on the sale of the nyse technologies companies as any differences in the carrying value of these net assets was adjusted in the nyse purchase price allocation see “ recent developments” above and refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for more information on our discontinued operations disclosures

on november 13 2015 we entered into a 500 million 364 day senior unsecured revolving credit facility or the 2015 364 day facility pursuant to a credit agreement with wells fargo as administrative agent bank of america na as syndication agent and the lenders signatory thereto the amounts available under the 2015 364 day facility are available for use by us for working capital and general corporate purposes but specifically excluding any use to backstop amounts issued under the commercial paper program the commitments under the 2015 364 day credit facility will be automatically reduced to 375 million on may 13 2016 and to 250 million on august 13 2016 borrowings under the 2015 364 day facility will bear interest on the principal amount outstanding under the same terms as the amended credit facility disclosed above 

the 2015 364 day facility includes an unutilized revolving credit commitment fee that is equal to the unused maximum revolver amount multiplied by an applicable commitment fee rate and is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis the applicable commitment fee rate ranges from 007 to 0175 and is determined based on our long term debt rating as of december 31 2015 the applicable commitment fee rate was 010 based on our current long term debt ratings 

in july 2013 we entered into a 600 million 364 day senior unsecured revolving credit facility or the 2013 364 day facility the 2013 364 day facility was available for working capital and general corporate purposes in october 2013 we borrowed 450 million under the 2013 364 day facility to fund the prepayment of the private senior notes in december 2013 we repaid the 450 million borrowed under the 2013 364 day facility with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper in connection with us entering into the 2014 credit facility the 2013 364 day facility was terminated in april 2014 at which time no amounts were outstanding 

nyse notes 

in connection with the acquisition of nyse one of our subsidiaries assumed the outstanding nyse debt instruments which included 850 million of 20 senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in october 2017 or the nyse usd notes and €920 million 11 billion of 5375 senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in june 2015 or the nyse eur notes and together with the nyse usd notes the nyse notes

refer to note 9 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our debt and debt facilities 

future capital requirements 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate of our trading and clearing volume growth strategic plans and acquisitions available sources for financing activities required technology and clearing initiatives regulatory requirements the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products the geographic mix of our business and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic trading and clearing platforms we currently expect to make aggregate operational capital expenditures and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between 270 million and 280 million for the year ended december 31 2016 which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology and the continued expansion of our businesses in addition we currently expect between 45 million to 55 million in real estate capital expenditures during 2016 on leasehold improvement expenditures primarily associated with our atlanta headquarters 

our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board of directors or audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio during the year ended december 31 2015  we paid cash dividends of 290 per share of our common stock in the aggregate including a quarterly dividend for the first quarter of 2015 of 065 per share and quarterly dividends for the next three quarters of 2015 of 075 per share for an aggregate payout of 331 million in 2015 which includes the payment of dividend equivalents for the first quarter of 2016 we announced a 085 per share dividend which is a 13 increase over the prior dividend which is payable on march 31 2016 to shareholders of record as of march 16 2016 

as of december 31 2015  we had 73 billion  in outstanding debt we currently have 34 billion  available for borrowing under our amended credit facility after factoring in the 26 billion  currently required to backstop the commercial paper program 809 

million  of our amended credit facility is currently available for general corporate purposes on november 13 2015 we entered into the 500 million 2015 364 day facility the amounts available under the 2015 364 day facility are available for use by us for working capital and general corporate purposes but specifically excluding any use to backstop amounts issued under the commercial paper program 

our 34 billion  amended credit facility our 500 million 2015 364 day facility and our commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have with third parties for liquidity and capital resources in the event of any strategic acquisitions mergers or investments or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders we may incur additional debt issue additional equity to raise the necessary funds repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend however we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us see “ debt” above 

in connection with our acquisition of nyse we assumed nyse’s pension plans covering its us and certain european operations the benefit accrual for the us operations pension plan is frozen following the euronext ipo in june 2014 there are no longer any nyse european operations covered by the pension plans during the year ended december 31 2015  we contributed 10 million  to our pension plans our practice is to fund our frozen defined benefit pension plan each year at a level above the minimum required contribution but within tax deductible limits based on actuarial projections we estimate that a contribution of 10 million in 2016 will allow us to meet our funding goal however the actual contribution is contingent on the actual plan performance relative to assumptions 

we own ice futures europe and liffe administration and management or liffe both of which are uk recognized investment exchanges as uk recognized investment exchanges ice futures europe and liffe are required by the financial conduct authority in the uk to satisfy a financial resources recognition requirement which restrict the use of the equivalent of six  months of operating expenditures subject to certain deductions in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times as of december 31 2015  the regulatory capital for ice futures europe and liffe was 57 million  and 106 million  respectively such amounts are reflected as shortterm restricted cash and investments in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015  in november 2014 we completed the transition of liffe’s contracts to ice futures europe while liffe still has a regulated status as of december 31 2015  we have applied for a derecognition order which will result in the release of the 106 million  in regulatory capital and an increase in our cash and cash equivalents when approved 

we own a 40 interest in occ through a direct investment by nyse occ adopted a new capital plan during the year ended december 31 2015 which raised 150 million in equity capital from occs shareholders including 60 million contributed by us in addition under the occ capital plan the occ shareholders will contribute up to 200 million in additional equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached including up to 80 million to be contributed by us refer to note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere is this annual report for additional information on the occ capital plan 

nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than gaap measures alone in addition we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for periodtoperiod comparison of results because the items described below are not reflective of our core business performance these financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to gaap financial measures and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance we strongly recommend that investors review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 

adjusted total operating expenses adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income attributable to ice common shareholders from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance and their related income tax effect in millions except for percentages and per share amounts   



acquisitionrelated transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses except for those that are directly related to the announcement closing financing or termination of a transaction however the acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs relating to nyse and interactive data are included in nongaap adjustments given the sizes of these acquisitions amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles are included in nongaap adjustments as excluding these noncash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results 

during the year andor three months ended december 31 2015 we also include as nongaap adjustments various litigation settlements and accruals and the interest expense on the senior notes and commercial paper we issued for the interactive data acquisition from the issuance date of the new senior notes on november 24 2015 and on the issuance dates of the commercial paper in early december 2015 to the acquisition date of interactive data on december 14 2015 during the year and three months ended december 31 2014 we also include as nongaap adjustments the net gain on the sale of our 6 remaining ownership in euronext and the income recognized on our occ equity investment during the year andor three months ended december 31 2013 we also include as nongaap adjustments the impairment loss recorded on our equity investment in cetip the expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt and the duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs we incurred as we consolidated multiple new york office locations for additional information on these items refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report and “ operating expenses” and “ nonoperating income expenses” above the 

income tax effects relating to these items above are included in nongaap adjustments as well as deferred tax adjustments on acquisitionrelated intangibles and other tax adjustments relating to certain foreign tax law changes 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table presents for the periods indicated our contractual obligations which we intend to fund from our existing cash as well as cash flow from operations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2015  in millions 



purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty 

we have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above 512 billion in cash margin deposits and guaranty fund liabilities clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund the cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits and guaranty funds’ liabilities 

we have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits or utbs from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above as of december 31 2015  our cumulative utbs were 107 million interest and penalties related to utbs were 33 million as of december 31 2015  we are under examination by various tax authorities we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax interest and penalties if any that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our utbs 

as of december 31 2015  in connection with our acquisition of nyse we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs the date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs 

we have a 40 ownership in occ under the occs new capital plan the occ shareholders have committed to contribute up to 200 million in equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached including up to 80 million to be contributed by nyse see “ future capital requirements” above 

new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us 

critical accounting policies 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the accounting matters described below we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments based on these factors we make estimates and judgments about among other things the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies among others affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results assets and liabilities 

goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 

we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired including other identified intangible assets we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift our judgments may change which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances as of december 31 2015  we had goodwill of 121 billion and net other intangible assets of 108 billion relating to our acquisitions our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties and the russell licensing agreement of these amounts 36 billion in goodwill and 32 billion of other intangible assets relates to our recent acquisitions of interactive data on december 14 2015 and trayport on december 11 2015 we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

in performing the purchase price allocation we consider among other factors the intended future use of acquired assets analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business at the acquisition date a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation we continue to review and validate estimates assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period accordingly these estimates and assumptions are subject to change which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition the allocation of the purchase price for interactive data and trayport will be finalized upon the completion of the analysis of the acquired assets and liabilities including goodwill and other intangible assets during the year ended december 31 2016 

our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangibles to its estimated fair value we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination subsequent to our acquisition of nyse we identified five reporting units our futures reporting unit our cds reporting unit our cash listings reporting unit our euronext reporting unit and our technology reporting unit the cash listings euronext and technology reporting units were added as part of our nyse acquisition on november 13 2013 as a result of the ipo of euronext and the sale of nyse technologies during the year ended december 31 2014 we no longer have a euronext reporting unit or a technology reporting unit we completed the acquisitions of interactive data and trayport in december 2015 subsequent to our annual impairment test completed in our fiscal fourth quarter and are in the process of evaluating the impact to our reporting units 

goodwill impairment testing consists of a twostep methodology the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value including goodwill and other intangible assets of such reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no impairment loss is recognized and the second step which is a calculation of the impairment is not performed however if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value for annual goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill and other intangible assets if we conclude that this is the case we must perform the twostep methodology described above otherwise we can skip the twostep methodology and do not need to perform any further testing for annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount 

application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows longterm growth rates of our business operating margins discount rates weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets these estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment and changes to these estimates and assumptions as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor impairment the cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and when applicable various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of our business adverse market conditions adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations competition or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets through december 31 2015  

we are also required to evaluate other finitelived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable if impairment indicators are present then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these longlived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable if an asset is not recoverable the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis our evaluation has not resulted in any impairment of other finitelived intangible assets and property and equipment through december 31 2015  

among our finitelived intangible assets we performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis to test whether the cds creditex customer relationship intangible asset was recoverable as we concluded that indicators of impairment were present in the current year   cds trade execution revenues at creditex have decreased over the last several years as trading volumes in the global cds market have declined and cds trading remains muted due to financial reform implementation and lower volatility in corporate credit markets we identified the decline in revenues and the delay in their expected recovery as a triggering event in the current year requiring our creditex customer relationship intangible asset to be tested for recoverability as of december 31 2015 the creditex customer relationship intangible asset had a remaining net book value of 61 million and will become fully amortized in august 2020 the results of the recoverability test indicated that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the asset by 8 

we continue to monitor potential triggering events in our cds trade execution business including changes in the business and regulatory climate in which it operates the volatility in the capital markets our recent operating performance and our financial projections any changes in these factors could result in further testing for recoverability and if it was determined that the carrying value of the asset was not recoverable an impairment of the asset would then be recorded 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us uk and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse 

we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position if the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 

the undistributed earnings from our nonus subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no provision for us federal and state income taxes has been made in our consolidated financial statements a distribution of these nonus earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise could subject us to both us federal and state income taxes as adjusted for nonus tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various nonus countries determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable 

we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter at any point in time many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities changes in facts and circumstances issuance of new regulations and resolution of tax audits 

we believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

item 7 a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a result of our operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure manage monitor and report risk exposures which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2015  and 2014  our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments were 16 billion and 25 billion respectively of which 448 million and 15 billion respectively were denominated in pounds sterling euros or canadian dollars of the 15 billion as of december 31 2014 €969 million 12 billion represented eurodenominated cash that was placed in term deposits at various banks with a maturity date of june 25 2015 that were used to repay the nyse eur notes on maturity at june 30 2015 the decrease in the balances above as of december 31 2015 was due to the use of the shortterm eurodenominated term deposit investments to repay the nyse eur notes upon their maturity the remaining cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments are denominated in us dollars we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes a hypothetical decrease in longterm interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pretax earnings by 2 million as of december 31 2015  assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments 

our investment in cetip which is recorded as an availableforsale longterm investment and is recorded and held in brazilian reais was valued at 299 million as of december 31 2015  including an accumulated unrealized loss of 25 million changes in the fair value of the cetip investment are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and do not impact earnings except to the extent that unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary 

as of december 31 2015  we had 73 billion  in outstanding debt of which 39 billion relates to senior notes and 852 million relates to the nyse notes all of which bear interest at fixed interest rates the remaining amount outstanding of 26 billion relates to the commercial paper program which bears interest at fluctuating rates and therefore subjects us to interest rate risk a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in longterm interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31 2015  would decrease annual pretax earnings by 26 million assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  debt” included elsewhere in this annual report 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as an international business we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros certain assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries our exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the year ended december 31 2015  is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table dollars in millions except exchange rates 

 we have a significant part of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros for the year ended december 31 2015  15 of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros and 12 of our consolidated expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes the us equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly 

we have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables that occur through our operations which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods we had foreign currency transaction losses of 14 million 2 million and 2 million for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar which strengthened a 10 adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2015  would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of 7 million assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity 

historically we have not entered into forward currency exchange rate contracts and to the extent that our currency exposures are not hedged exchange rate movements may cause fluctuations in our consolidated financial statements accordingly if there are adverse movements in exchange rates our revenues may be lower and we may suffer significant losses which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition although we may enter into hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities 

we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using a current rate of exchange with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account a component of equity our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below in millions 



as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive income loss from foreign currency translation was 45 million and 13 million respectively as of december 31 2015  we had net exposure of pounds sterling and euro of £950 million 14 billion and €154 million 168 million respectively based on these december 31 2015  net currency positions a hypothetical 10 decrease of pound sterling against us dollar would negatively impact our equity by 141 million and a hypothetical 10 decrease of euro against us dollar would negatively impact our equity by 17 million for the year ended december 31 2015  currency exchange rate differences had a negative impact of 58 million on our consolidated equity 

credit risk 

we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments wellcapitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties 

an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties our policies require diversification of counterparties banks financial institutions bond issuers and funds so as to avoid a concentration of risk 

clearing house cash deposit risks 

our clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit market and liquidity risks refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report for more information about clearing house cash deposits which were 512 billion  as of december 31 2015  while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits as the clearing houses may pass on interest revenues minus costs to the members this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated

we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we execute agreements and make investments in addition when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits reflecting a number of factors including ratings assigned by rating agencies cds spreads and internal ratings as well as the nature and maturity of transactions we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring financial assets are placed with governments wellcapitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties 

an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties our policies require diversification of counterparties banks financial institutions bond issuers and funds to avoid a concentration of risk 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency in the right place and the right time to mitigate this risk the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets for example holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of purchased securities to decline if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity and interest rates had risen the sale of the securities might be made at a loss relative to the latest market price our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments of cash deposits for example where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities in addition the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt for example us treasury securities and supranational debt instruments euro cash deposits only with short dated maturities 

security issuer risk 

security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments 

investment counterparty risk 

investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and thus fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral under the repurchase agreement to high quality issuers when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts under clearing house control additionally the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2 of the reverse repurchase amount thus in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty’s obligation to the clearing house 

our clearing houses may use third party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided to them by the clearing house such investment advisors do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control clearing house property is held with credit worthy custodians including jpmorgan chase bank na citibank na bny mellon bmo harris na and euroclear bank brussels for nonus dollar deposits 

each clearing house employs or may employ multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single investment advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role additional investment advisors or custodians are available as alternatives 

crosscurrency margin deposit risk 

each of our clearing houses pursuant to their rules may permit posting of crosscurrency collateral to satisfy margin requirements for example accepting margin deposits denominated in us dollars to secure a euro margin obligation the clearing houses mitigate the risk of a decline in currency value by applying a “haircut” to the currency posted as margin at a level sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of high currency volatility crosscurrency balances are markedtomarket on a daily basis should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a sameday basis 

impact of inflation 

we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or to decline in the event of inflation we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants as the prices that we charge are not governed by longterm contracts 




 item 7 a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a result of our operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure manage monitor and report risk exposures which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2015  and 2014  our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments were 16 billion and 25 billion respectively of which 448 million and 15 billion respectively were denominated in pounds sterling euros or canadian dollars of the 15 billion as of december 31 2014 €969 million 12 billion represented eurodenominated cash that was placed in term deposits at various banks with a maturity date of june 25 2015 that were used to repay the nyse eur notes on maturity at june 30 2015 the decrease in the balances above as of december 31 2015 was due to the use of the shortterm eurodenominated term deposit investments to repay the nyse eur notes upon their maturity the remaining cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments are denominated in us dollars we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes a hypothetical decrease in longterm interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pretax earnings by 2 million as of december 31 2015  assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments 

our investment in cetip which is recorded as an availableforsale longterm investment and is recorded and held in brazilian reais was valued at 299 million as of december 31 2015  including an accumulated unrealized loss of 25 million changes in the fair value of the cetip investment are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and do not impact earnings except to the extent that unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary 

as of december 31 2015  we had 73 billion  in outstanding debt of which 39 billion relates to senior notes and 852 million relates to the nyse notes all of which bear interest at fixed interest rates the remaining amount outstanding of 26 billion relates to the commercial paper program which bears interest at fluctuating rates and therefore subjects us to interest rate risk a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in longterm interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31 2015  would decrease annual pretax earnings by 26 million assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  debt” included elsewhere in this annual report 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as an international business we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros certain assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries our exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the year ended december 31 2015  is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table dollars in millions except exchange rates 

 we have a significant part of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros for the year ended december 31 2015  15 of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros and 12 of our consolidated expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes the us equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly 

we have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables that occur through our operations which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods we had foreign currency transaction losses of 14 million 2 million and 2 million for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar which strengthened a 10 adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2015  would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of 7 million assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity 

historically we have not entered into forward currency exchange rate contracts and to the extent that our currency exposures are not hedged exchange rate movements may cause fluctuations in our consolidated financial statements accordingly if there are adverse movements in exchange rates our revenues may be lower and we may suffer significant losses which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition although we may enter into hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities 

we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using a current rate of exchange with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account a component of equity our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below in millions 



as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive income loss from foreign currency translation was 45 million and 13 million respectively as of december 31 2015  we had net exposure of pounds sterling and euro of £950 million 14 billion and €154 million 168 million respectively based on these december 31 2015  net currency positions a hypothetical 10 decrease of pound sterling against us dollar would negatively impact our equity by 141 million and a hypothetical 10 decrease of euro against us dollar would negatively impact our equity by 17 million for the year ended december 31 2015  currency exchange rate differences had a negative impact of 58 million on our consolidated equity 

credit risk 

we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments wellcapitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties 

an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties our policies require diversification of counterparties banks financial institutions bond issuers and funds so as to avoid a concentration of risk

clearing services 

we currently own or operate the following seven clearing houses 

 12 

 our clearing strategy is designed to provide financial security to our diverse markets while providing capital efficiency and meeting the risk management capital and regulatory requirements of a global marketplace our clearing houses clear settle and guarantee the financial performance of futures contracts and options on futures contracts ice clear europe also clears european cds instruments and ice clear credit clears north american european and emerging market cds instruments through each of our clearing houses we maintain a system for the performance of financial obligations for the products we clear this system is supported by several mechanisms including rigorous clearing membership requirements daily marktomarket of positions and payment of variation margin the calculation and posting of original margin deposits a limited contribution of the clearing houses capital maintenance of guaranty funds in which clearing members maintain deposits to mutualize losses and broad assessment powers all of which cover financial losses beyond the resources of a defaulting clearing member the amount of margin and guaranty fund deposits on hand fluctuates over time as a result of among other things the extent of open positions held at any point in time by market participants and the volatility of the market as reflected in the applicable margin rates for such contracts 

to ensure performance our clearing houses maintain extensive technology and quantitative risk management systems as well as financial and operational requirements for clearing members and minimum margin requirements for our cleared products our clearing houses use software based on industry standard margining conventions and on our proprietary models uniquely customized to our products to determine the appropriate margin requirements for each clearing member by simulating the possible gains and losses of complex portfolios based on price movements 

our clearing houses have an excellent track record of risk management and have never experienced an incident of a clearing member default which has required the use of the guaranty funds of nondefaulting members or the assets of the clearing house nevertheless we have extensive risk management procedures in place to ensure we protect the interests of our clearing members and clearing houses each of our clearing houses has a instituted multilayered risk management system of rules policies and procedures to protect itself in the event of a clearing member default 

in the event of a payment default by a clearing member the applicable clearing house would follow the default procedures specified in the rules of that clearing house in general the clearing houses would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing member to cover its payment obligation these assets include originalinitial margin variation margin positions held at the clearing house and guaranty fund deposits of the clearing member in addition the clearing houses could make a demand for payment pursuant to any available guarantee provided to the clearing houses by the parent or affiliate of the defaulting clearing member thereafter if the defaulted payment obligation remains unsatisfied the clearing houses would use the guaranty fund contributions of other clearing members as well as any designated contributions by the clearing house itself as applicable and funds collected through an assessment against all other nondefaulting clearing members to satisfy the deficit as part of the powers and procedures designed to backstop financial obligations in the event of a default each of our clearing houses may levy assessments on all of their clearing members if there are insufficient funds available to cover a deficit following the depletion of all assets in the guaranty fund prior to such assessment 

we offer clearing services for the cds markets through ice clear credit and ice clear europe in risk management frameworks that are separate from one another and from our futures and options or noncds clearing operations we have established separate cds risk pools for ice clear credit and ice clear europe including separate guaranty funds and margin accounts meaning that the cds positions are not combined with positions in our traditional futures and options clearing houses the cds clearing houses have risk management systems that are designed specifically for cds instruments and have independent governance structures both cds clearing houses are openaccess pursuant to regulatory requirements and therefore accept qualifying trades for clearing that are executed on other venues as of december 31 2014 our cds clearing houses clear 379 single name instruments and 122 cds indexes 

we have committed 303 million in borrowing capacity under our credit facilities to assist our clearing houses with liquidity that may be needed to both operate and manage a default during a time of financial stress see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources which is included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

ice clear credit currently selfmanages clearing members cash on deposit to satisfy originalinitial margin and guaranty fund requirements ice clear us and ice clear europe currently use external investment managers for investment activity of their clearing member cash deposits in july 2012 the financial stability oversight council designated ice clear credit as a systemically important financial market utility under title viii of the doddfrank act 

to provide a tool to liquidate margin and guaranty fund deposits held in the form of high quality sovereign debt ice clear europe ice clear credit and ice clear us have entered into committed repurchase agreement facilities or committed repo each of these clearing houses is seeking to increase both the amount and the number of counterparties to its existing committed repo facilities as of december 31 2014 ice clear europe had 350 million in committed repo ice clear credit had 100 million and ice clear us had 200 million as of january 9 2015 ice clear europe increased its committed repo to 450 million and ice clear us increased its committed repo to 250 million the ice clear europe committed repo is available in us dollars euro and pound sterling the ice clear credit committed repo is available in us dollars and euro and the ice clear us committed repo is available in us dollars 

the committed repo arrangements provide these three clearing houses with an additional liquidity tool that may be used in the event there is a need to convert high quality sovereign debt into cash on a sameday basis during a market disruption that makes it difficult to sell and settle such sovereign debt on a sameday basis

• secure central counterparty clearing houses and risk management for our global markets 

• leading global listings and trading venues and 

• widelydistributed leading edge technology for trading clearing data and trade processing 

many of our futures contracts serve as global benchmarks for managing risk relating to exposure to price movements in the underlying products including financial energy and agricultural commodities for example we operate the leading market for trading in ice brent crude oil futures as measured by the volume of contracts traded in 2014 according to the futures industry association the ice brent crude futures contract is the leading benchmark for pricing light sweet crude oil produced and consumed outside of the united states the ice brent crude futures contract is part of the brent complex which forms the price reference for approximately twothirds of the world’s physical oil based on 2014 contract volume over half of the world’s crude and refined oil futures contracts were traded through ice futures europe in 2014 open interest in brent surpassed open interest in nymex wti for the first time in the contracts history in addition we operate a leading market for shortterm european interest rates or stir contracts with our principal stir contracts based on implied forward rates based on european money markets institute or emmi euribor rates as well as the sterling contract we also offer leading agricultural benchmark contracts including sugar cocoa cotton and coffee which serve as global price benchmarks

we offer a range of central clearing and related risk management services to promote the security of our markets the credit and performance assurance provided by our clearing houses to clearing members substantially reduces counterparty risk and is a critical component of our exchanges’ identities as reliable and secure marketplaces for global transactions we believe the services offered by our clearing houses are a competitive advantage and attract market participants to our exchanges our clearing houses are designed to protect the financial integrity of our markets by maintaining collateral facilitating payments and collections enhancing capital efficiency and limiting counterparty credit risk 

we operate the leading global listings and trading venues for equities and offer our customers access to the capital markets in the united states our various listing venues allow companies to list domestic and international equity securities corporate structured products convertible bonds trackers and debt securities in 2014 nyse was the global leader in ipos for the fourth consecutive year raising 703 billion in total ipo proceeds including leading in technology company ipos during the same period nyse was the leader in followon financings raising 1131 billion in proceeds

competition 

the markets in which we operate are global and highly competitive we face competition in all aspects of our business from a number of different enterprises both domestic and international including traditional exchanges electronic trading platforms and voice brokers we believe we compete on the basis of a number of factors including 

• depth and liquidity of markets 

• price transparency 

• reliability and speed of trade execution and processing 

• technological capabilities and innovation 

• breadth of product range 

• rate and quality of new product developments 

• quality of service 

• distribution and ease of connectivity 

• mid and backoffice service offerings including differentiated and valueadded services 

• transaction costs and 

• reputation 

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that our deep liquid markets breadth of product offerings new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to develop new and innovative products and services enhance our technology infrastructure maintain liquidity and offer competitive transaction costs 

in our derivatives markets certain exchanges replicate our futures contracts for example cme group the largest derivatives exchange in the united states with 91 market share of all us futures contracts traded competes with our exchanges on agricultural and energy commodities currency and equity index contracts we also compete in interest rates and equity derivatives with eurex which is the derivatives exchange operated by deutsche börse and nlx which is the multilateral trading facility operated by nasdaq 

we compete with voice brokers active in certain of the otc energy and credit derivatives markets other electronic trading platforms for derivatives clearing houses and market data vendors ice swap trade creditex and creditex brokerage compete with other swap execution facilities and large interdealer brokers in the credit derivatives market 

 in addition to competition from derivative exchanges that offer commodity products we also face competition from other exchanges electronic trading systems thirdparty clearing houses futures commission merchants and technology firms further certain financial services or technology companies have entered the otc trade execution services market additional joint ventures and consortia could form or have been formed to provide services that could potentially compete with certain services that we provide 

we face significant competition with respect to securities trading and this competition is expected to remain intense our current and prospective competitors include regulated markets electronic communication networks dark pools and other alternative trading systems market makers and other execution venues the 2014 merger of bats global markets inc or bats and direct edge llc may increase competitive pressures in securities trading we also face growing competition from large brokers and customers that may assume the role of principal and act as counterparty to orders originating from retail customers or by matching their respective order flows through bilateral trading arrangements including through internalization of order flow some of these competitors are among our largest customers or are owned by our customers in particular many of our key customers are prioritizing their internalization and alternative trading system businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business 

our principal competitor for listings in the united states is nasdaq omx group inc or nasdaq omx we also face competition for foreign issuer listings from a number of stock exchanges outside the united states including london stock exchange deutsche börse and stock exchanges in tokyo hong kong toronto singapore and australia as other liquidity venues seek exchange status we may face more competition for listings 

nyse arca and nyse amex options face considerable competition in the equity options markets their principal us competitors are the chicago board options exchange inc or cboe the international securities exchange holdings inc bats the boston options exchange group llc and the nasdaq omx as well as startups such as miami international securities exchange llc and elx futures lp backed by a consortium of banks and other market participants

regulation 

our markets are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory agencies in the united states the united kingdom the netherlands singapore and canada various domestic and foreign governments have undertaken reviews of their existing legal framework governing financial markets and have either passed new laws and regulations or are in the process of drafting andor 

enacting new laws and regulations that apply to financial services and markets including our business and our customers businesses 

in 2010 the us congress passed the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the doddfrank act through extensive rulemaking authority granted under the doddfrank act the cftc and sec were charged with creating a comprehensive new regulatory regime governing otc derivative markets and market participants including our otc markets and customers the doddfrank act requires among other things mandatory exchange trading clearing and reporting of otc derivatives and greater regulation of exchanges and clearing houses implementation of the doddfrank act in relation to the otc derivative markets is largely complete in the united states with rules relating to sec regulated equity derivatives left to be implemented 

the european union or eu has adopted legislation on otc and exchangetraded derivatives clearing houses and trade repositories commonly known as the european market infrastructure regulation or emir emir requires among other things all exchange traded and otc derivatives trades to be reported to trade repositories clearing of standardized otc derivative contracts and more stringent prudential operational and business requirements for clearing houses emir also requires clearing houses to require enough margin to cover an exchange traded derivatives futures position for two days and requires additional margin to provide for procyclicality both of which represent an increase over the present margining methodology the increased margin requirements for market participants could make trading of cleared futures contracts in europe more expensive for market participants which may cause our customers to prefer trading products under regulatory regimes in the united states or other jurisdictions and require us to restructure or move certain aspects of our business such an action would result in operational andor regulatory risks to our business the final form of the legislation was enacted in august 2012 and secondary legislation to enact emir became effective on march 15 2013 and is applicable to a central counterparty or ccp that has been authorized pursuant to emir ice clear europe applied to the bank of england and is in the process of being authorized as a ccp under emir 

in addition the eu finalized markets in financial instruments directives ii or mifid ii which prescribes new rules for trading clearing and reporting of financial products in europe in december 2014 the european securities and markets authority or esma finalized the first round of rulemaking the level 2 text for mifid ii the legislation and the level 2 text require european ccps to offer open access to trading venues for products that ccps currently clear the level 2 text further states that ccps must net equivalent products within the clearing house essentially treating a product traded on a competing venue the same as one traded on ice futures europe for example the legislation applies to both swaps and futures cleared by a european ccp open access could hurt the trading volumes on ice futures europe as other exchanges could offer competing equivalent products that ice clear europe would then clear in addition the legislation and level 2 text require exchanges such as ice futures europe to offer open access to other clearing houses which could impact business that is cleared at ice clear europe mifid ii rules would apply to other european clearinghouses and future exchanges and thus offer ice clear europe and ice futures europe the ability to connect to other exchanges and clearinghouses respectively the earliest implementation date for the legislation is january 3 2017 

we believe that many of the new requirements of the doddfrank act emir mifid ii and other global financial reform initiatives are consistent with the manner in which we already operate our business although the differences in implementation of financial reform by different countries may cause us to restructure certain parts of our business for example requirements to centrally clear otc swaps and trade them on regulated platforms are consistent with our existing business model the mandate to clear standardized swaps complements our clearing businesses while certain of these changes may have a positive impact on our business some changes could adversely affect our business refer to the discussion below and to the “risk factors” section for an additional description of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertainties 

derivatives regulation 

trade execution 

our us futures contracts are listed on ice futures us which is subject to extensive regulation by the cftc under the commodity exchange act or cea the cea generally requires that futures trading in the united states be conducted on a commodity exchange registered as a designated contract market or dcm as a registered dcm ice futures us is a selfregulatory organization that has instituted rules and procedures to comply with the core principles applicable to it under the cea ice futures us also has surveillance and compliance operations and procedures to monitor and enforce compliance with its rules and ice futures us is periodically audited by the cftc with respect to the fulfillment of its selfregulatory programs in these areas our us swaps business is listed on ice swap trade which is regulated as a sef by the cftc like registered dcms sefs are selfregulated organizations that must comply with core principles that are similar to the dcm core principles the cost of regulatory compliance for dcms and sefs is substantial in addition the increased regulation of derivatives transactions could result in reduced trading activity which could adversely affect our business 

the regulatory framework applicable to ice futures us and ice swap trade is supplemented by the cea which has provisions regulating the conduct of participants in the regulated market importantly the cea contains provisions making it an offense for participants to engage in certain market behavior such as market manipulation and prohibits market abuse breaches of those provisions give rise to the risk of sanctions including financial or criminal penalties in addition many market participants including clearing firms must independently register with the cftc and national futures association and perform various compliance and reporting functions 

in november 2013 the cftc proposed new rules placing position limits on 28 energy metals and agricultural contracts ice futures us has spot month position limits for its energy agricultural metals and certain financial products and also has single month and all month limits for certain agricultural metals and financial contracts if finalized the new rules will place federal all month and spot month limits on these 28 contracts and the limits will be aggregated across all us exchanges and the otc swaps markets key contracts included in the rule will be the henry hub natural gas contract and the ice wti crude oil contract the proposed rules state that financially settled contracts will maintain a position limit five times the limit for physically settled futures contracts if the cftcs position limits were to be imposed in the form proposed trading activity and liquidity on our exchanges may decline which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in the united kingdom ice futures europe is a recognized investment exchange or rie in accordance with the financial services and markets act 2000 or fsma like us regulated derivatives markets ries are selfregulatory organizations or sros with surveillance and compliance responsibilities the regulatory framework applicable to ice futures europe is supplemented by a series of legislative provisions regulating the conduct of participants in the regulated market importantly fsma contains provisions making it an offense for participants to engage in certain market behavior and prohibits market abuse through the misuse of information the giving of false or misleading impressions or the creation of market distortions breaches of those provisions give rise to the risk of sanctions including financial penalties

clearing 

ice clear credit ice clear us and tcc are regulated by the cftc as derivatives clearing organizations or dcos ice clear europe which is primarily regulated in the united kingdom by the bank of england as a recognized clearing house or rch is also subject to regulation by the cftc as a dco both ice clear credit and ice clear europe are also regulated by the sec as clearing agencies because they clear securitybased swaps dcos are subject to extensive regulation by the cftc under the cea as required by emir which came into force on march 15 2013 ice clear europe presented an application to the bank of england to be authorized under emir within the required timeframe emir also requires increased clearing house margin requirements as discussed above in addition to emir mifid ii further regulates european ccps as noted above the legislation and level 2 text state that european ccps must net equivalent products within the clearing house essentially treating a product traded on a competing venue the same as one traded on ice futures europe for example open access could hurt the trading volumes on ice futures europe as other exchanges could offer competing equivalent products that ice clear europe would then clear 

 under emir foreign domiciled ccps must be recognized by esma to conduct business in europe ice clear us ice clear credit and ice clear canada have made applications to esma to become recognized as emir third country ccps and esma has deemed those applications complete however esmas recognition of ice clear us ice clear credit and ice clear canada as third country ccps is dependent upon an equivalence decision by the european commission that each clearing houses home country regulatory framework is equivalent to the regulatory framework of the eu the european commission and the us cftc remain in dialog regarding the issue of equivalence and a final decision is anticipated in the first half of 2015 the deadline for emir equivalence determinations has been postponed until june 2015 failure by the european commission to find the united states or canada equivalent would result in higher capital charges for european clearing firms accessing us or canadian ccps and could cause those clearing firms to exit the us andor canadian markets 

in december 2014 ice acquired a seventyfive percent ownership interest in hch an emir authorized ccp hch is regulated by its national authority the dutch central bank 

in 2012 iosco issued principles for financial market infrastructures or pfmi clearing houses that adhere to the rules of their local regulator designed to meet the pfmis can be deemed to be a qualified central counter party or qccp generally global banking regulators give favorable capital treatment to banks that clear at qccps for example the us banking agencies the federal reserve the office of the comptroller of currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation issued final rules implementing the basel iii accord to encourage central clearing the final rules assess a relatively low risk weight of either 2 or 4 to a bank’s exposure to cleared derivatives held in a qccp ice clear credit as a systemically important financial market utility under title viii of the doddfrank act is deemed a qccp by us banking regulators ice clear europe hch ice clear us and ice clear canada adhere to the rules of their local regulator designed to meet the international standards set forth in the pfmis and accordingly retain their status as qccps we plan to seek qccp status for ice clear singapore which is regulated by the monetary authority of singapore as a designated clearing house 

europe and the united states among other g20 nations are implementing the basel committee’s supplementary leverage ratio or slr with a goal of full implementation by 2018 the current methodology for calculating the slr requires that banks treat initial margin received as collateral as part of their derivatives balance sheet which in turn increases the bank’s capital requirements if implemented in this manner the slr could increase the cost of derivatives clearing through banks which serve the majority of our derivatives markets and this may increase costs to trade and clear for market participants 

trade reporting 

a key aspect of financial reform efforts is the reporting of derivatives trades to trade repositories in the united states all swaps must be reported to swap data repositories or sdrs in june 2012 the cftc provisionally registered ice trade vault as a sdr for the credit and commodity asset classes in europe emir requires all derivatives trades futures or swaps to be reported to a trade repository in november 2013 esma approved ice trade vault europe as a trade repository in advance of emir’s trade reporting deadline in february 2014 in september 2014 ice trade vault received trade repository approval from the canadian provinces of ontario quebec and manitoba we expect to continue to seek approvals to serve as a trade repository as other jurisdictions finalize their reporting rules

 item 1a risk factors   

you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect our company in the future if any of the risks discussed below actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our business and operating results depend in large part on volatility in financial markets including the prices and interest rates underlying our derivative products and may be adversely impacted by domestic and international economic and market conditions 

participants in the markets for our products including energy and agricultural commodities financial and equity derivatives and other securities trade pursuant to a range of trading strategies trading volume is driven primarily by the degree of volatility  the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations  in prices and interest rates of the underlying commodities indices benchmarks or other measures volatility increases the need to hedge contractual price risk and creates opportunities for speculative or arbitrage trading were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices of the underlying commodities indices benchmarks or other measures of our derivative products we could experience lower trading volumes slower growth or declines in revenues 

factors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility and thus trading volumes and our operating results include 

 any one or more of these factors may reduce trading activity which could make our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which in turn could further discourage existing and potential market participants and thus accelerate a decline in the level of trading activity in these markets further most of these factors are beyond our control a significant decline in our trading volumes could have a material adverse effect on our transactionbased revenues and the demand for our market data moreover if these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets could be jeopardized because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our current products and services decline for any reason we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues and our net income will decline 

the conditions in global financial markets and new laws and regulations as a result of such conditions may adversely affect our trading volumes market liquidity and revenue 

a significant portion of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses are derived from fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets we derived 61 79 and 87 of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses from our transactionbased business for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively in particular we derive a significant percentage of the consolidated revenues from our transactionbased business from trading in ice brent crude futures and options contracts north american natural gas futures and options contracts equity transactions and short term 

interest rates contracts including the euribor and short sterling futures and options contracts consequently declines in trading volumes and market liquidity generally or in our ice brent crude north american natural gas or short term interest rates futures and options contracts in particular would adversely affect our business and profitability in addition revenues from our security exchanges are primarily derived from listing fees trading activity and demand for related market data adverse economic conditions and regulatory changes could result in decreased trading volume discourage market participants from listing on our equity exchanges or cause market participants to reduce the size of new offerings listed on our security exchanges 

the trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of trading activity for any reason including the factors referenced above that impact volatility or other factors many of which we do not control such as 

 a reduction in our overall trading volume could also render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenues a reduction in trading volumes would also likely result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for our market data that would reduce our overall revenue 

our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to increased legislation and regulatory scrutiny and we face the risk of changes to this regulatory environment and business in the future which may reduce our trading and clearing volumes or increase our cost of doing business 

as an owner and operator of regulated exchanges and clearing houses for the global financial and commodity markets we are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions around the world and in particular in the united states and united kingdom where the largest portions of our operations are conducted we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments among other things as a result of regulators enforcing existing laws and regulations we could be censured fined prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees in many cases our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation across jurisdictions 

there is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or those of our clients including access to our markets and capital liquidity and margin requirements could be imposed which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or which may impact our clients’ overall trading volume through our exchanges and demand for our market data and other services regulations imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally could adversely impact levels of market activity and price volatility more broadly and thus impact our businesses 

us and european legal and regulatory developments in response to the global financial crisis in particular the us doddfrank act emir and mifid ii have significantly altered or may alter the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability among the aspects of these recently enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes most related our business are mifid ii’s open access and netting requirements mifid ii’s benchmark access requirements the cftc’s proposed rules limiting aggregate positions for energy and agricultural products across exchanges in the spot month and across all months commodity position limit rules in europe basel iii supplemental leverage ratio rules and emir’s rule requiring clearing houses use a twoday margin period and antiprocyclicality charges in the calculation of initial margin in addition as the operator of a global business the lack of harmonization in international financial reform efforts could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in different jurisdictions other enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability 

these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions these developments could cause us to incur significant 

costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our products and businesses to other jurisdictions there are operational regulatory and competition risks associated with making changes to our business to address these developments and if we are not successful in adapting to these developments we could lose a significant portion of our business 

please see “item 1  business  regulation” above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations 

systems failures elsewhere in the securities trading industry could also negatively impact us 

highprofile system failures in the securities trading industry have renewed concerns among regulators and investors about the safety and resiliency of trading platforms it is possible that regulators could impose new requirements for trading platforms that would be costly for us to implement or that could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services in particular in november 2014 the sec issued the final regulation systems compliance and integrity or regulation sci which will require the systems used to operate our securities exchanges secregistered clearing houses and alternative trading systems to meet certain industry standards conduct periodic stress tests establish business continuity and disaster recovery plans and provide certain notifications in the event of system disruptions and other events ensuring our compliance with the requirements of regulation sci could require significant implementation costs as well as increased ongoing administrative expenses and burdens if systems failures in the industry continue to occur it is also possible that investor confidence in the trading industry could diminish leading to decreased trading volume and revenue whether or not any of our own systems experience material failures any of these developments could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

our compliance and risk management methods as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

our ability to comply with applicable complex and changing laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel while we have policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks and regulatory obligations including ices risk committee that assists the board of directors with oversight of risk management we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed regulators periodically review our exchanges’ ability to selfregulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and selfregulatory standards in particular certain of our businesses acquired in the nyse acquisition are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations policies and procedures if we fail to comply with any of these obligations regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business 

our exchanges operate as forprofit businesses but under applicable law have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled finra performs market surveillance and related enforcement activities with respect to our secregulated us exchanges duties which nyse regulation our wholly owned notforprofit indirect subsidiary will assume from finra beginning january 1 2016 nyse regulation currently oversees finra’s performance of crossmarket surveillance and related enforcement activities with respect to our secregulated us exchanges enforces listed company compliance with applicable standards oversees regulatory policy determinations rule interpretation and regulationrelated rule development and conducts limited realtime trading reviews any failure by one of our exchanges with selfregulatory responsibility to diligently and fairly regulate its member organizations ensure market compliance or to otherwise fulfill its regulatory obligations including any failure by nyse regulation resulting from the transition of market surveillance and enforcement activities from finra could significantly harm our reputation prompt regulatory scrutiny and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we must allocate significant resources to fulfill our selfregulatory responsibilities including the engagement of certain technology vendors by nyse regulation for the development and implementation of an enhanced surveillance system the forprofit entitys goal of maximizing stockholder value might contradict the exchange’s responsibilities as a regulator of its members users and listed companies 

in addition our regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations proceedings and wells’ notices that may result in substantial penalties settlements or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which can be significant any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to continue to conduct our business 

the ability of our exchanges to comply with all applicable laws and rules as a selfregulatory organization is largely dependent on our maintenance of compliance surveillance audit and reporting systems we cannot assure you that these systems and procedures are fully effective failure to comply with current or future regulatory requirements could subject us to significant penalties including termination of our ability to conduct our regulated businesses further the implementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to operate expand and enhance our electronic platform as necessary to remain competitive and grow our business which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense competition that could materially and adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition in all aspects of our business we believe competition in our businesses is based on a number of important factors including but not limited to market liquidity transparency technology advancements platform speed and reliability regulatory differences new and existing product offerings reputation transaction costs pricing and risk management capabilities our competitors both domestic and international are numerous we currently compete with 

 voice brokers active in the energy commodities and credit markets 

 trends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings a regional exchange in an emerging market country such as brazil india or china or a producer country could attract enough trading activity to compete with certain of our benchmark commodity derivative products in our equities business the merger of bats global markets inc and direct edge llc in 2014 may increase competitive pressures finally many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and alternative trading system businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business 

a decline in our fees due to competitive pressure the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers if we are not able to compete successfully our business could be materially impacted including our ability to sustain as an operating entity 

in our equity listings business the legal and regulatory environment in the united states and the market perceptions about that environment may make it difficult for our us equity exchanges to compete with nonus equity exchanges for listings for example negative perceptions regarding compliance costs associated with adherence to corporate governance requirements have and may continue to discourage future listings on us equity exchanges by both us and foreign private issuers any failure by our equity exchanges to successfully compete for any reason could adversely impact our revenue derived from listing fees and the associated trading execution and market data fees 

we may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our acquisition of nyse 

the success of our acquisition of nyse will depend in part on our ability to realize anticipated cost savings revenue synergies and growth opportunities we expect to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of 

capabilities and elimination of redundancies specifically we expect to achieve cost savings of approximately 550 million entering 2017 we have set an aggressive timeline for realizing these cost savings resulting from the acquisition with nearly 75 synergy achievement by the end of 2015 we expect to realize at least 450 million of the synergies entering 2016 which assumes we successfully undertake a variety of actions including but not limited to integrating technology eliminating redundancies and effecting an organizational restructuring that are themselves subject to a variety of risks and may be subject to regulatory approvals that we do not control 

there is a risk however that we may not integrate nyse in a manner that permits these costs savings and revenue synergies to be realized in the time we originally anticipated or at all in addition a variety of factors including but not limited to regulatory conditions or delay currency fluctuations and difficulty integrating technology platforms may adversely affect our anticipated cost savings and synergies also we must achieve the anticipated cost savings without adversely affecting our revenues if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

we may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from mergers and acquisitions strategic joint ventures or investments which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

the success of our mergers and acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated expense synergies integration success and growth opportunities as well as capitalize on revenue growth opportunities in general we expect to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies however the process of integration may disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and delays including inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants regulators and others require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business as a result we may not successfully achieve the integration objectives from any particular merger or acquisition and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings revenue growth and synergies in full or at all or it may take longer to realize them than expected 

we may also not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures that we have entered into or may enter into in the future for a number of reasons including regulatory or government approvals or changes global market changes contractual obligations competing products and in some instances our lack of or limited control over the management of the business further strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future 

we intend to continue offering new products and to explore acquisition opportunities and strategic alliances relating to other businesses products or technologies which will involve risks we may not be successful in offering new products or identifying opportunities 

we intend to launch new products and continue to explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may spend substantial time and money developing new product offerings or improving current product offerings if these product offerings are not successful we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to offset the costs of such initiatives obtaining any required regulatory approval associated with these product offerings may also result in delays that cause us to miss potential market opportunities or result in conditions that prevent us from offsetting the costs associated with these product offerings we may also enter into business combination transactions make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures or alliances any of which may be material and will involve risks further we may enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry attracting customers in certain countries may also be subject to a number of risks including currency exchange rate risk difficulties in enforcing agreements or collecting receivables longer payment cycles compliance with the laws or regulations of these countries and political and regulatory uncertainties 

in addition in light of consolidation in the exchange and clearing sector and competition for opportunities we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully our competitors could merge making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors also offering new products and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives that are necessary for our success 

as a result of any future acquisition we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute shareholders’ ownership interest in us expend cash incur debt assume contingent liabilities inherit existing or pending litigation or regulatory investigations or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets with estimable useful lives any of which could harm our business financial condition or results of operations and negatively impact our stock price further we cannot assure you that any such financing will be available or that the terms of such financing or equity offering will be favorable to us 

as a result of our acquisition of superderivatives we now have operations in israel and conditions in israel could affect our operations and ability to efficiently and effectively integrate superderivatives business 

political economic and military conditions in israel may affect our superderivatives operations a number of armed conflicts have occurred between israel and its arab neighbors and there continues to be unrest and terrorist activity in israel the conflicts and terrorist activities have continued with varying levels of severity through the recent period of time and have led to ongoing hostilities between israel and the palestinian authority and other groups in the west bank and gaza strip the future effects of these hostilities on our israeli operations are unclear but could range from delays in product development to a cessation of our operations in israel for a period of time further if emergency circumstances or an escalation in these hostilities occurs some of our israeli employees may be called for active duty which could result in our operations in israel not functioning at full capacity our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected as a result 

owning clearing houses exposes us to risks including the risk of defaults by clearing members clearing trades through our clearing houses risks regarding investing the funds in the guaranty fund and held as security for original margin and risks related to the cost of operating the clearing houses 

operating clearing houses requires material ongoing expenditures and exposes us to various risks there are risks inherent in operating a clearing house including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members defaults by clearing members and risks associated with holding and investing collateral provided by clearing members to our clearing houses which could subject our business to substantial losses for example clearing members have placed an aggregate amount of cash in ice clear europe relating to margin requirements and funding the guaranty funds of 263 billion as of december 31 2014 and a total of 475 billion for all of our clearing houses as of december 31 2014 ice clear europe and ice clear us use external investment managers for investment activity of their clearing members cash deposits and may add or change the external investment managers from time to time ice clear credit currently selfmanages the cash that its clearing members leave on deposit to satisfy their respective original margin and guaranty fund requirements 

our clearing houses have an obligation to return margin payments and guaranty fund contributions to clearing members once the relevant clearing member’s exposure to the clearing house no longer exists if the number of large wellcapitalized banks that are clearing members decreases the concentration of risks within our clearing houses will be spread among a smaller pool of clearing members which makes it more difficult to absorb and manage risk in the event of a clearing members default 

although our clearing houses have policies and procedures to help ensure that clearing members can satisfy their obligations such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a clearing members default in addition the process for deriving margins and financial safeguards for trading activity is complex and although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and establishing financial safeguards there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect us from the risks of clearing certain products we cannot assure you that these measures and safeguards will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default we have contributed our own capital to the default resources of the clearing houses which could be used in the event of a default where the defaulting clearing participant’s margins and the defaulting clearing participant’s guaranty fund contributions are not sufficient to cover the default we anticipate that we will increase the amount of our own capital contributed to the clearing houses’ default resources in response to commercial pressures and regulatory requirements furthermore the default of any one of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and cause our customers to lose confidence in our clearing houses 

our clearing houses hold substantial amounts of funds and sovereign and government guaranteed agency debt securities as collateral for original margin and guaranty fund deposits a decline in the value of these securities or default by a sovereign government could subject our clearing houses to additional risks of default by their clearing members 

our clearing houses hold a substantial amount of client assets as collateral which comprise us and other sovereign treasury securities as of december 31 2014 our clearing houses held 295 billion of noncash collateral 224 billion of this amount was comprised of us treasury securities 12 billion was comprised of french treasury securities 955 million was comprised of italian treasury securities 931 million was comprised of uk treasury securities 629 million was comprised of german treasury securities and 34 billion was comprised of other european japanese and triparty treasury securities sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived 

credit worthiness of major governments but the markets for such treasury securities have experienced significant volatility recently our clearing houses apply a discount or haircut to the market values for all sovereign securities held as collateral the markets for such treasury securities have experienced significant volatility recently related to ongoing financial challenges in some major european countries and negotiations regarding raising the debt ceiling in the us government’s negotiations regarding tax increases spending cuts and raising the debt ceiling which is the maximum amount of debt that the us government can legally incur in addition a collapse of the euro could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates 

notwithstanding the current intraday margin and valuation checks conducted by our clearing houses our clearing houses will need to continue to monitor the volatility and value of us and other sovereign treasury securities because if the value of these treasury securities declines significantly our clearing houses will need to collect additional collateral from their clearing members which may be difficult for the clearing members to supply in the event of a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government in addition our clearing houses may be required to impose a more significant discount on the value of sovereign treasury securities posted as collateral if there is uncertainty regarding the future value of these securities which would trigger the need for additional collateral contributions by the clearing members 

further our clearing houses invest large sums of money through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and may hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions our clearing houses may make time deposits with banks that are secured only to the value of fdic insurance and therefore our deposits may in significant part be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent our clearing houses that utilize time deposits currently manage such exposure by limiting the counterparties with which time deposits are made and the value of such loans however such limits may not be feasible in the event of a significant shortfall in available security for loans in such event our clearing houses may make time deposits with less creditworthy counterparties or increase the loan size limit for existing counterparties which leads to more risks with respect to the funds held by the clearing houses and could lead to substantial losses 

our systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks hacking and cyberattacks especially in light of our role in the global financial markets which could result in interruption of our business wrongful use of our information or make our participants reluctant to use our electronic platform 

the ability to reliably transact on our electronic platforms and the secure transmission of confidential information are critical elements of our operations our networks and those of our participants third party service providers and external market infrastructures may however be vulnerable to compromise security technology failure denial of service attacks or other security failures resulting in lack of availability loss of data integrity information disclosure fraud or other outcomes harmful to our business recently the financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of political protest activism and fraud in addition the financial services industry has been targeted by foreign state actors and terrorist organizations seeking to disrupt our business and the financial systems of the countries in which we operate further former employees of certain companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly 

although we have not been the victim of cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have resulted in a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cyber security events including distributed denial of service attacks malware infections phishing web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size we operate what we believe to be an effective information security program that is designed to prevent detect track and mitigate cyber incidents and although we intend to implement additional industry standard security measures in the future to maintain the effectiveness of our information security program we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against attacks losses or reduced trading volume in our markets as a result of any security breach hacking or cyberattack any such attacks could cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose business or incur significant liabilities result in reputational damage and have a negative impact on our competitive position additionally current and future security measures are likely to be expensive to purchase and maintain which could adversely impact our net income or require additional capital expenditures 

if we are unable to keep pace with rapid changes in technology and market participant preferences we may not be able to compete effectively 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary technology the financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change change in use patterns change in client preferences frequent product and service introductions and the emergence of new industry standards and practices these changes could render our existing proprietary technology uncompetitive 

or obsolete our ability to pursue our strategic objectives including increasing trading volumes on our trading platforms as well as our ability to continue to grow our business will depend in part on our ability to 

 we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology to our participants’ requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and costeffective manner any failure to remain abreast of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to participant preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our revenues 

our business may be harmed by computer and communications systems failures and delays or the inability to access key physical locations including trading floors 

we support and maintain many of the systems that comprise our electronic platforms our failure to monitor or maintain these systems or to find replacements for defective components within a system in a timely and costeffective manner when necessary could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business although we fully replicate our primary data center our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of systems failure cybersecurity breach or trading floor closure our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

 we could experience system failures or a floor closure due to natural disasters fire sabotage power or telecommunications failures human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyberattacks intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar events if any one or more of these situations were to arise they could result in damage to our business reputation and participant dissatisfaction which could prompt participants to trade elsewhere or expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions as a consequence our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

our regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in volume of order and trading transaction traffic and to provide processing and clearing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

we rely on third party providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of an important service or supply by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as online service providers hosting service and software providers data processors software and hardware vendors banks local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading clearing and other systems we rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with third parties and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for the provision of hosting services the general trend toward industry consolidation may increase the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future if these companies were to discontinue providing services to us for any reason or fail to provide the type of service agreed to we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients or increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines 

many of our clients also rely on third parties such as online service providers software providers software and hardware vendors local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform if these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients’ inability to transact with our businesses 

damage to our reputation resulting from our administration of libor and other benchmarks could adversely affect our business 

our subsidiary iba is the administrator for various benchmarks including libor among others ibas administration of libor resulted from steps taken by government authorities to address underlying flaws in the computation of libor including fraudulent actions taken by banks to falsely inflate or deflate reported rates in order to profit from interest rate trades or to give the impression that the banks were more creditworthy than they in fact were any failures or negative publicity resulting from our administration of libor or other benchmarks could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and could harm our reputation damage to our reputation could cause some market participants to reduce their trading volume on our exchanges or to cease using some or all of our other services any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

since we conduct operations in several different countries including the united states european countries and canada substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling euros and canadian dollars because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

although we have entered into hedging transactions and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities accordingly if there are adverse movements in exchange rates we may suffer significant losses which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our investment in or acquisition of businesses outside of the united states and developing markets in particular could subject us to a variety of investment risks 

we have investments outside of the united states including in countries with developing financial and commodity derivatives markets in particular we own 12 of the common stock of cetip completed the acquisition of the ice futures singapore a singapore exchange operator for commodity trading in asia in february 2014 and completed the acquisition of superderivatives a market data trading technology and analytics company with operations in israel in october 2014 in december 2014 we completed the transaction to acquire a majority stake in holland clearing house a derivatives clearing house based in amsterdam that provides clearing for the order machine a european multilateral trading facility the ability of companies we invest in or acquire to maintain or expand their businesses may be subject to many risks to which we are not otherwise subject including market risks related to sufficient demand to support the expansion of their business local legal and regulatory risks and political risks such as nationalization expropriation and outbreak of hostilities or war this is particularly true for any investments we make in companies operating in developing markets which may be subject to greater fluctuations in trading volumes and other revenue sources as the markets for their products are not sufficiently established there is no guarantee that our investments will be successful or that we will be able to sell our investments or acquisitions at prices and terms favorable 

to us further a decrease in value of the currencies where we have investments or acquired businesses would decrease the value of our investments or acquired businesses in these foreign jurisdictions and would have a negative impact on our financial statements 

loss of our exclusive or nonexclusive licenses to list certain products could adversely affect our business 

we hold exclusive and nonexclusive licenses to list various index futures and contracts including russell msci and ftse indexes as well as the dtcc gcf repo index® futures the owners of these indices may not renew the licenses with us on an exclusive basis or at all and the terms of some of these licenses including our licensing agreement with russell require that we achieve certain volume levels to maintain exclusivity additionally litigation or regulatory action may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and contracts trading to a single exchange and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license as previously discussed mifid ii introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of services relating to commodity derivatives across europe and the legislation requires open access to any benchmarks a benchmark is an index or other measure used to determine the value of a financial instrument for example libor or the sp 500 used in europe the final scope of the requirement is expected to be decided over the next year if unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive license were permitted we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products in addition we hold a nonexclusive license to various energy futures contracts settling on assessments published by mcgrawhill subsidiary platts we have worked with platts on multiple longterm initiatives within our energy trading and market data businesses and if these licenses became unavailable to us we could lose trading volume and associated revenues 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill other intangible assets or investments which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets with respect to our acquisitions and other investments requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2014 we had goodwill of 85 billion and net other intangible assets of 78 billion relating to our acquisitions our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties and the russell licensing agreement we also have 379 million in longterm investments relating to our equity security investment in cetip we recorded a 190 million impairment loss on our investment in cetip during the year ended december 31 2013 primarily due to the devaluation of the brazilian real for additional information on the cetip impairment refer to note 5 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we assess goodwill other intangible assets and other investments and assets for impairment by applying a fairvalue based test looking at historical performance capital requirements and projected cash flows on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 

we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may result in asset impairments an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill other intangible assets and other investments and assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results for additional information on our goodwill other intangible assets and investments refer to notes 5 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes and “critical accounting policies  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets” in item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

owning and operating voice broker businesses exposes us to additional risk and these businesses are largely dependent on their brokerdealer clients 

our voice broker business is primarily transactionbased and it provides brokerage services to clients primarily in the form of agency transactions although it also engages in a limited number of matched principal transactions in agency transactions customers pay transaction fees for trade execution services in which we connect buyers and sellers who settle their transactions directly in matched principal transactions also known as “riskless principal” transactions we agree to buy instruments from one customer and sell them to another customer the amount of the fee generally depends on the spread between the buy and sell price of the security that is brokered the majority of transactions by creditex and creditex brokerage which are the subsidiaries that engage in our voice broker business are agency transactions and the matched principal transactions accounted for 5 of the total transactions for creditex and creditex brokerage for the year ended december 31 2014 with respect to matched principal transactions a counterparty to a matched principal transaction may fail to fulfill its obligations or creditex or creditex brokerage may face liability for an unmatched trade declines in trading volumes in credit derivatives would adversely affect the revenues we derive from creditex we also face the risk of not being able to collect transaction or processing fees charged to customers for brokerage services and processing services we provide 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties including trademarks service marks trade names trade secrets copyrights and patents we cannot assure you that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property additionally we may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property our failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively further we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights which may require significant financial and managerial resources as a result we may choose not to enforce our infringed intellectual property rights depending on our strategic evaluation and judgment regarding the best use of our resources the relative strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the recourse available to us 

in addition our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may have obtained and may be expected to obtain in the future patent rights related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services as a result we may face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the holders of the patents or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patents we also could be required to pay damages if we were found to infringe patents held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we are subject to significant litigation and liability risks 

many aspects of our business including trading clearing market data services benchmark services and listings and the businesses of our participants involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred for example dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platform or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades abusive trading practices security and confidentiality breaches mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants in addition because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by entering them inaccurately a large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets 

in addition we are subject to various legal disputes some of which we are involved in due to acquisition activity although in certain aspects of our operations we are immune from private suits arising from conduct within our regulatory authority and from acts and forbearances incident to the exercise of our regulatory authority we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations of andor direct actions brought by the sec the cftc and other government regulators we could incur significant expenses defending lawsuits and other claims even those without merit which could adversely affect our financing condition and operating results an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results please see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a summary of our legal proceedings and claims 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

given our prominence in the global financial markets and the location of many of our properties and personnel in us and european financial centers we may be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business 

damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees in addition terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets including trading on exchanges any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we currently have substantial outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis that could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness 

following our acquisition of nyse we have significant outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis as of december 31 2014 we had 43 billion of outstanding debt this level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business and could make it difficult to satisfy our debt obligations increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restrict us from pursuing certain business opportunities as we use our available resources to reduce and refinance our consolidated debt our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue future business opportunities may be further constrained in addition the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants including a leverage ratio test and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other matters we have elected to hold 12 billion of the proceeds we received from the euronext ipo to repay 12 billion of legacy nyse debt and interest that matures in june 2015 

our longterm debt is currently rated by moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s these ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time and it is possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade us in the future in particular our inability to sustain reduced debt on a consolidated basis may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings in addition a significant decrease in our credit rating could impact the regulatory status of our clearing houses and make parties less willing to do business with our clearing houses and our exchanges that clear products through our clearing houses any downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase the cost of any future debt funding we may obtain 

we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt is dividends from our subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock further we have guaranteed the payment of certain debt obligations by our subsidiary nyse holdings llc this guarantee may require us to provide substantial funds or assets to creditors of our subsidiaries at a time when we are in need of liquidity to fund our own obligations and may affect our ability to make dividend payments to our stockholders principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock 

provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ice 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for ice these provisions make a change of control less likely which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of us and european equity exchanges for example our organizational documents include provisions that require our board of directors to consider the impact on our security exchanges to discharge their responsibilities and duties prior to taking certain actions and generally restrict any person either alone or together with its related persons from i voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10 of our outstanding voting capital stock including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock or ii beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock further our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to call special stockholders’ meetings or act by written consent and generally authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock in addition provisions of delaware law may have a similar effect such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders as defined under delaware law from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the board of directors

consolidated financial highlights 

the following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented dollars in millions except per share amounts 



1 the adjusted numbers in the table above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance net of taxes as applicable as a result these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with us gaap see “ nonus gaap financial measures” below 

 factors affecting our results 

the business environments in which we operate directly affect our results of operations our results have been and will continue to be affected by many factors including the level of trading activity in our markets which during any period is significantly influenced by general market conditions competition price volatility market share and the pace of industry consolidation broad trends in the brokerage and finance industry price levels and price volatility the number and financial health of companies listed on nyse’s cash markets geopolitical events weather and disasters real and perceived supply and demand imbalances availability of capital changing technology in the financial services industry and legislative and regulatory changes among other factors in particular in recent years the business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings the globalization of exchanges customers and competitors market participants’ demand for speed capacity and reliability which requires continuing investment in technology and increasing competition for market data revenues price volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates the need for the exchange of risk between market participants market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market’s strength the maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing 

the implementation of new regulations may impact participation in our markets generally legislative and regulatory bodies in the united states and europe have expressed increased concern regarding derivatives markets when underlying commodity prices rise as a result legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants which could affect trading volumes in particular many of the proposed changes are still being implemented and final regulations have not yet been adopted or significant uncertainties and ambiguities remain around adopted regulations in addition many market participants are still determining how they will respond to these regulations as a result it is 

difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us however it may possibly result in increased costs and the expenditure of significant resources 

low interest rates and uncertainty in the us financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a slow economic recovery equity market indices became increasingly volatile in the later part of 2014 economic uncertainty in the european union may also continue to negatively affect global financial markets in addition economic uncertainty has continued to affect our clients’ activities business models and technology spending over the last several years we expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our businesses we have diversified our business so that we are less subject to the reduction in volatility trading activity or participation in any one asset class in addition we have increased our portion of nontransaction and clearing revenues from 13 in 2012 to 39 in 2014 we continue to focus on our strategy to broaden and diversify our revenue streams as well as on our companywide expense reduction initiatives in connection with our acquisition of nyse in order to mitigate these uncertainties 

we also periodically make adjustments to our contract specifications changes to contracts are generally aimed at making the contracts more relevant to more customers and their evolving hedging needs or are required based on changes to the underlying commodity and may result in fluctuations in trading volume in the near term with the objective of making the contract more relevant to our customers over the long term in 2014 we transitioned our gasoil contract to a lowsulphur gasoil contract and that transition was completed in january 2015 these and other factors could cause our revenues to fluctuate from period to period and these fluctuations may affect the reliability of period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results 

 segment reporting 

we previously operated as a single reportable business segment as of december 31 2013  the ice segment as of march 31 2014 we operated as two business segments the ice segment and the euronext segment which was reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviewed and operated the business following the ipo and deconsolidation of euronext in june 2014 we reverted to one business segment as this is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviewed and operated the business as of june 30 2014 and for all subsequent periods 

revenues 

total revenues less transactionbased expenses exclude euronext and nyse technologies revenues which are included in income from discontinued operations see  discontinued operations below the following table presents our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses from continuing operations in millions except for percentages 



transaction and clearing fees net 

a majority of our revenue is derived from transaction and clearing fees our transaction and clearing fees are reported on a net basis except for the transactionbased expenses discussed below and consist of fees collected from our derivatives trading and clearing and subsequent to our acquisition of nyse on november 13 2013 from our us cash trading and us equity options businesses in our derivatives markets we earn transaction and clearing fees from both counterparties to each contract that is traded andor cleared revenues for percontract fees are driven by the number of trades executed and fees charged per contract the amount of our percontract transaction and clearing fees will depend upon many factors including but not limited to market conditions transaction and clearing volume pricing product mix and new product introductions because transaction and clearing fees are assessed on a percontract or notional value basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume but not to the same degree due to product mix and pricing see “ factors affecting our results” above 

in our derivatives markets following our acquisition of nyse we recognize transaction and clearing fee revenues from executing and clearing trades based on interest rate agriculture and equity derivatives futures and options trading volume in european interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility resulting from expectations for changes in the level and term structure of shortterm interest rates and in economic data and trading in equity derivatives including equity indexes and single stock futures is primarily driven by volatility 

we also receive transaction fee revenues from us equity and equity options markets including the new york stock exchange nyse arca nyse mkt and nyse amex options this revenue includes routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other market for execution 

our us equities markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act these section 31 fees are designed to recover the governments costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals we or occ on our behalf in turn collect activity assessment fees which are included in transaction and clearing fees in our 

consolidated statements of income from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the us equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts when invoiced the activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the section 31 fees which are included in transactionbased expenses in our consolidated statements of income as a result activity assessment fees and section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income activity assessment fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and as required by law the amount due to the sec is remitted semiannually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid as of december 31 2014 the accrued liability related to the unremitted sec section 31 fees was 137 million 

certain energy futures and options volumes and related revenues have declined or remained flat for the year ended december 31 2014  from the comparable period in 2013  these energy contracts include north american natural gas and power futures and options contracts and gasoil futures and options contracts gasoil is a key refined oil products benchmark in europe and asia which underwent transition to a new specification during 2014

in addition to the nyse other revenues the increase in other revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 from the comparable period in 2012 is primarily due to revenues that we recorded following the whentech acquisition in september 2012 and the ice endex acquisition in march 2013 a reduction in the net interest paid to clearing members for their cash margin deposits at ice clear europe and the fees that we recognized relating to the clearing services agreement for ice clear europe to provide clearing services to nyse liffe from july 1 2013 to november 12 2013 the interest paid to clearing members is recorded as a reduction to other revenues effective january 1 2013 ice clear europe no longer pays clearing members basis points on certain cash margin deposits

compensation and benefits expenses increased for the last two years primarily due to increases in employee headcount our employee headcount increased primarily due to the nyse acquisition internal hiring relating to the nyse integration our other acquisitions and hiring for clearing technology regulation and compliance headcount increased from 1077 employees as of december 31 2012 to 1133 employees as of december 31 2013 excluding the nyse employees an increase of 5 compared to the prior year and increased to 1650 employees as of december 31 2014 excluding the nyse employees an increase of 46 compared to the prior year 

as of december 31 2014  we had 1252 nyse employees compared to 3099 nyse employees as of december 31 2013 the decrease in the nyse employees during the year ended december 31 2014  is primarily related to the reduction of the euronext employees following the ipo on june 24 2014 of which there were 1049 euronext employees as of december 31 2013 the sale of nyse technologies and employee terminations in connection with the integration of nyse we recognized 290 million and 46 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively subsequent to our acquisition on november 13 2013 

noncash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were 82 million 56 million and 52 million for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the increase for the year ended december 31 2014 primarily relates to a greater number of employees receiving noncash awards due to the headcount increases discussed above

requirements changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly 

technology and communication expenses increased the last two years compared to the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of nyse expenses following our acquisition acquisitions and growth in various contract volumes we recognized 132 million and 13 million in technology and communication expenses relating to nyse during the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively

the increases in professional services expenses during the year ended december 31 2014 were partially offset by decreases in professional services expenses during the fourth quarter of 2014 relating to a credit we received from the financial industry regulatory authority or finra and a reduction in expenses related to the termination of certain services agreements and related agreements or slas with euronext 

financial operational and sales practice oversight of the members of our us securities exchanges is generally conducted by finra in addition finra performs the market surveillance and related enforcement functions for our us securities exchanges pursuant to an agreement with us although our us securities exchanges retain ultimate regulatory responsibility for the regulatory functions performed by finra under that agreement finra charges our us securities exchanges throughout the year based on their estimated costs for these services and then trues up the charge at year end to actual costs incurred based on the actual finra charges incurred to us during 2014 versus what we were accruing we recorded a credit of 7 million during the fourth quarter of 2014 in january 2016 nyse regulation plans to take over market surveillance investigation and enforcement functions for nyse equity and options markets from finra

upon the termination of the 2011 credit facilities and the 364 day facility intercontinental exchange holdings incs guarantees were no longer required and therefore intercontinental exchange holdings incs guarantees were automatically released in accordance with their terms on april 3 2014 in connection with our entry into the 2014 credit facility nyse agreed to guarantee the 2014 credit facility as a subsidiary guarantor for as long as nyse remains a guarantor of the 2014 credit facility it will remain a guarantor of the senior notes and the commercial paper program we expect that nyse’s guarantee of the 2014 credit facility the senior notes and the commercial paper program will be released when the nyse notes have been repaid as the 2014 credit facility provides that nyse’s guarantee will be released in accordance with their terms if certain conditions are satisfied including compliance with the covenant limiting the amount of indebtedness of nonobligor subsidiaries and an investmentgrade credit rating 

committed repo 

to provide a tool to liquidate margin and guaranty fund deposits held in the form of high quality sovereign debt ice clear europe ice clear credit and ice clear us have entered into committed repurchase agreement facilities or committed repo each of these clearing houses is seeking to increase both the amount and the number of counterparties to its existing committed repo facilities as of december 31 2014 ice clear europe had 350 million in committed repo ice clear credit had 100 million and ice clear us had 200 million as of january 9 2015 ice clear europe increased its committed repo to 450 million and ice clear us increased its committed repo to 250 million the ice clear europe committed repo is available in us dollars euro and pound sterling the ice clear credit committed repo is available in us dollars and euro and the ice clear us committed repo is available in us dollars 

the committed repo arrangements provide these three clearing houses with an additional liquidity tool that may be utilized in the event there is a need to convert high quality sovereign debt into cash on a sameday basis during a market disruption that makes it difficult to sell and settle such sovereign debt on a sameday basis 

multicurrency payment facility 

ice clear us requires its clearing members to meet nonus dollar payment obligations in the currency of the obligation ice clear us also accepts foreign currencies as collateral to satisfy original margin requirements for those contracts which are denominated in a foreign currency in addition in order to meet its obligation to make settlement payments in all relevant currencies ice clear us uses its own capital to purchase the relevant foreign currencies as determined by its daily liquidity calculations in the event a clearing member were to fail to make payment in a nonusd currency ice clear us will use the applicable foreign currency posted to satisfy original margin requirements in addition to the applicable foreign currency held by ice clear us in order to meet its settlement obligations in such currency 

future capital requirements 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate of our trading and clearing volume growth strategic plans and acquisitions required technology and clearing initiatives regulatory requirements the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products the geographic mix of our business and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic trading and clearing platforms we currently expect to make aggregate operational capital expenditures and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between 165 million and 175 million for the year ended december 31 2015 which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology and the continued expansion of our businesses in addition we currently expect between 70 million to 80 million in capital expenditures during 2015 on leasehold improvement expenditures primarily associated with our nyse headquarters in new york 

our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board or audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio during the year ended december 31 2014 we paid a quarterly dividend of 065 per share per quarter of our common stock for an aggregate payout of 299 million which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on february 5 2015 we announced a 065 per share dividend for the first quarter of 2015 with the dividend payable on march 31 2015 to shareholders of record as of march 17 2015 the exdividend date will be march 13 2015 

as of december 31 2014 we had 43 billion in outstanding debt we currently have 30 billion available for borrowing under our 2014 credit facility after factoring in the 905 million currently required to backstop the commercial paper program and the 303 million reserved for our clearing houses as discussed above 18 billion of our 2014 credit facility is currently available for general corporate purposes see “ debt” above 

the 2014 credit facility and the commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have with third parties for liquidity and capital resources in the event of any strategic acquisitions mergers or investments or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders we may incur additional debt issue additional equity to raise the necessary funds repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend however we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us we have used and intend to use the cash proceeds from the euronext ipo to repay debt we have used the net cash proceeds from the sales of nyfix metabit and wombat to invest in growth initiatives pursue strategic investments return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases and repay debt see “ recent developments” above 

in connection with our acquisition of nyse we assumed nyse’s pension plans covering its us and certain european operations the benefit accrual for the us operations pension plan is frozen following the euronext ipo in june 2014 there are no longer any nyse european operations covered by the pension plans during the year ended december 31 2014 we contributed 51 million  to our pension plans our practice is to fund our frozen defined benefit pension plan each year at a level above the minimum required contribution but within tax deductible limits based on actuarial projections we estimate that a contribution of 10 million in 2015 will allow us to meet our funding goal however the actual contribution is contingent on the actual plan performance relative to assumptions 

prior to our acquisition nyse completed the sale of a significant equity interest in nyse amex options one of its two us options exchanges to seven external investors under the terms of the sale the external investors have the option to require us to repurchase a portion of its equity interest on an annual basis over the course of five years which began in 2011 we currently own 84 of nyse amex options and the remaining 16 of the outstanding shares of nyse amex options currently valued at 125 million can be put back to us by the external investors in 2015 and these shares are recorded as redeemable noncontrolling interest as of december 31 2014

we own ice futures europe and in connection with the nyse acquisition liffe administration and management or liffe both of which operate as uk recognized investment exchanges as uk recognized investment exchanges ice futures europe and liffe are required by the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom to restrict the use of the equivalent of six months  of operating expenditures subject to certain deductions in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times as of december 31 2014  the regulatory capital for ice futures europe and liffe was 57 million  and 114 million  respectively such amounts are reflected as shortterm restricted cash and investments in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2014 in november 2014 we completed the transition of liffe’s contracts to ice futures europe while liffe still has a regulated status we expect to apply for a derecognition order in 2015 which will result in the release of the 114 million in regulatory capital and an increase in our cash and cash equivalents at this time we do not expect the regulatory capital at ice futures europe to increase during 2015 from 57 million  as this balance already takes into account the higher postliffe migration cost base 

as a uk recognized clearing house ice clear europe is required by the bank of england in the united kingdom to restrict the use of the equivalent of six months of operating expenditures subject to certain deductions in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times as of december 31 2014  this amount for ice clear europe was 87 million  and is reflected as shortterm restricted cash and investments in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2014 when emir becomes effective which is currently anticipated during the first half of 2015 the bank of england restricted cash capital requirements for ice clear europe will be superseded by the emir capital requirements which would require an increase in the liquid regulatory capital requirements of 136 million we also expect ice clear europes regulatory capital to increase by an additional 45 million to 50 million during the second quarter of 2015 in connection with the growth of our clearing business and costs at ice clear europe these regulatory capital increases will be satisfied by way of additional restricted cash through our cash on hand 

in connection with our acquisition of nyse we obtained a 40 ownership in occ occ serves as a clearing house for securities options security futures commodity futures and options on futures traded on various independent exchanges occ clears securities options traded on nyse arca and nyse mkt occ is regulated by the sec as a registered clearing agency and by the cftc as a derivatives clearing organization occ is developing a new capital plan which is scheduled to be finalized during the first quarter of 2015 subject to regulatory and occ shareholders’ approvals which would potentially raise 150 million in equity capital from occs shareholders including 60 million to be contributed by nyse in exchange for the equity capital from its shareholders occ would subject to determination by its board of directors and compliance with legal requirements commit to pay an annual dividend to its shareholders equal to the aftertax income of occ in excess of the amount required to maintain its target capital requirement and satisfy other capital requirements and after refunds to its clearing members equal to 50 of distributable earnings before tax in addition under the occ new capital plan the occ shareholders would commit to contribute up to 200 million in additional equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached including up to 80 million to be contributed by nyse unless and until such 200 million capital contribution is repaid to the shareholders occ would not declare any dividends and would not pay refunds to its clearing members see “ nonoperating income expenses” above 

nonus gaap financial measures 

we use nonus gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions when viewed in conjunction with our us gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than us gaap measures alone in addition we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for periodtoperiod comparison of results because the items described below are not reflective of our core business performance these financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to us gaap financial measures and may be different from nonus gaap measures used by other companies we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on us gaap financial measures since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance we strongly recommend that investors review the us gaap financial measures included in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 

adjusted total operating expenses adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted income from continuing operations adjusted net income attributable to ice and adjusted earnings per share for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance and their related income tax effect in millions except per share amounts   



we include acquisitionrelated transaction costs as part of our core business expenses except for those that are directly related to the announcement closing financing or termination of a transaction however we are including all of the acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs relating to our acquisition of nyse as nonus gaap adjustments given the size of the acquisition 

including a loss of 4 million  for the year ended december 31 2014 in connection with pension plan settlements made for early termination lumpsum payments made in 2014 we are also showing as nonus gaap adjustments our amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles as excluding these noncash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and cash operating results 

during the year and three months ended december 31 2014 in addition to the adjustments for the nyse acquisitionrelated integration costs and the amortization of the acquisitionrelated intangibles we also include as adjustments the net gain on the sale of our 6 remaining ownership in euronext and the income recognized on our occ equity investment during the year and three months ended december 31 2013 in addition to the adjustments for the nyse acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs and the amortization of the acquisitionrelated intangibles we also include as adjustments the impairment loss recorded on our equity investment in cetip the banker success fee relating to the acquisition of ice endex the expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt the impact of certain foreign tax law changes that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013 and the duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs we incurred as we consolidated multiple new york office locations in the current year during the year and three months ended december 31 2012 we include as adjustments the nyse acquisitionrelated transaction costs and amortization of the acquisitionrelated intangibles for additional information on these items refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and “ operating expenses” and “nonoperating income expenses” above 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table presents for the periods indicated our contractual obligations which we intend to fund from operations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2014  in millions 



we have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above 475 billion in cash margin deposits and guaranty fund liabilities clearing members of ice clear europe ice clear us ice clear credit ice clear canada tcc and hch are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund the cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits and guaranty funds’ liabilities 

we have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits or utbs from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above as of december 31 2014  our cumulative utbs were 145 million interest and penalties related to utbs were 45 million as of december 31 2014  we are under continuous examination by various tax authorities we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax interest and penalties if any that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on our utbs 

as of december 31 2014  in connection with our acquisition of nyse we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs the date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs 

prior to our acquisition nyse completed the sale of a significant equity interest in nyse amex options one of its two us options exchanges to seven external investors under the terms of the sale the external investors have the option to require us to repurchase a portion of their equity interest on an annual basis over the course of five years which began in 2011 since the likelihood of us acquiring the noncontrolling interest in the future is probable the full redemption fair value has been recorded as mezzanine equity and we have classified the related balance as “redeemable noncontrolling interest” in our consolidated balance sheet we currently own 84 of nyse amex options and the remaining 16 of the outstanding shares of nyse amex options currently valued at 125 million can be put back to us by the external investors in 2015 and these shares are recorded as redeemable noncontrolling interest as of december 31 2014 however we cannot estimate whether the external investors will elect to exercise their remaining put options and it has been excluded from the table above see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on the redeemable noncontrolling interest 

in connection with our acquisition of nyse we obtained a 40 ownership in occ occ is developing a new capital plan which is scheduled to be finalized during the first quarter of 2015 subject to occ’s regulatory and occ shareholders’ approvals which would potentially raise 150 million in equity capital from occs shareholders including 60 million to be contributed by nyse in addition under the occ new capital plan the occ shareholders would commit to contribute up to 200 million in additional equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached including up to 80 million to be contributed by nyse however we cannot estimate whether the occ new capital plan will be approved and for how much and the 60 million initial contribution and the potential 80 million additional contribution from us has been excluded from the table above see “ future capital requirements” above 

new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us 

critical accounting policies 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the accounting matters described below we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments based on these factors we make estimates and judgments about among other things the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies among others affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results assets and liabilities 

goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 

we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired including other identified intangible assets we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use 

significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift our judgments may change which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances as of december 31 2014  we had goodwill of 85 billion and net other intangible assets of 78 billion relating to our acquisitions our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties and the russell licensing agreement of these amounts 61 billion in goodwill and 70 billion of other intangible assets relates to our acquisition of nyse on november 13 2013 we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

in performing the purchase price allocation we consider among other factors the intended future use of acquired assets analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business at the acquisition date a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation we continue to review and validate estimates assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period accordingly these estimates and assumptions are subject to change which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition 

our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangibles to its estimated fair value we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination subsequent to our acquisition of nyse we identified five reporting units our futures reporting unit our cds reporting unit our cash listings reporting unit our euronext reporting unit and our technology reporting unit the cash listings euronext and technology reporting units were added as part of our nyse acquisition on november 13 2013 as a result of the ipo of euronext and the sale of nyse technologies during the year ended december 31 2014 we currently have three reporting units our futures reporting unit our cds reporting unit and our cash listings reporting unit 

goodwill impairment testing consists of a twostep methodology the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value including goodwill and other intangible assets of such reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no impairment loss is recognized and the second step which is a calculation of the impairment is not performed however if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value for annual goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill and other intangible assets if we conclude that this is the case we must perform the twostep methodology described above otherwise we can skip the twostep methodology and do not need to perform any further testing for annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount 

application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows longterm growth rates of our business operating margins discount rates weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets these estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment and changes to these estimates and assumptions as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor impairment the cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and when applicable various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of our business adverse market conditions adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations competition or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets through december 31 2014 among our reporting units the fair value of our cds reporting unit has been the closest to its carrying value in prior goodwill impairment analyses our cds reporting unit includes the financial results and net assets of creditex ice clear credit and the cds clearing business at ice clear europe cds trade execution revenues at creditex have decreased the last several years the cds execution business remains pressured due to financial reform implementation and a general lack of volatility in the corporate credit markets however the decline in cds trading revenues was offset by an increase in ice cds clearing the listing of additional cleared cds products and signing on new clearing members along with a decrease in expenses at creditex also with the advent of mandatory clearing during 2013 cds clearing activity by investment funds asset managers and similar buy side market participants has increased significantly 

during the first step of the cds impairment review in the fourth quarter of 2014 we performed a discounted cash flow valuation to estimate the fair value of our cds reporting unit the valuation of our cds reporting unit concluded that the fair value exceeded carrying value by 751 million or 132 of the carrying value in the fourth quarter of 2014 as of december 31 2014 the cds goodwill and other intangible assets balances were 476 million the discount rate used in the cds discounted cash flow valuation is intended to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the cds reporting unit and was 92 in the fourth quarter 2014 review a 10 basis point increase in the discount rate used would not have a material impact on our fair value of the cds reporting unit a 10 decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the cds reporting unit would result in the fair value of the reporting unit exceeding the carrying value by 548 million 

given the current market conditions and continued economic and regulatory uncertainty the fair value of our cds reporting unit may deteriorate and could result in the need to record an impairment charge in future periods we continue to monitor potential triggering events in our cds reporting unit including changes in the business and regulatory climate in which it operates the current volatility in the capital markets our recent operating performance and our financial projections any changes in these factors could result in an impairment charge 

we are also required to evaluate other finitelived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable if impairment indicators are present then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these longlived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable if an asset is not recoverable the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis our evaluation has not resulted in any impairment of other finitelived intangible assets and property and equipment through december 31 2014 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse 

we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position if the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 

the undistributed earnings from our nonus subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no provision for us federal and state income taxes has been made in our consolidated financial statements a distribution of these nonus earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise could subject us to both us federal and state income taxes as adjusted for nonus tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various nonus countries determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable 

we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter at any point in time many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities changes in facts and circumstances issuance of new regulations and resolution of tax audits 

we believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits 

in connection with our acquisition of nyse we assumed nyse’s pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans covering its us and certain european operations following the euronext ipo in june 2014 there are no longer any nyse european operations covered by the pensions plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans pension and other postretirement employee benefits costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts these assumptions include discount rates to measure future obligation and interest expense mortality rates health care cost trend rates benefits earned interest cost expected return on assets and other factors in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 




 item 7 a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a result of our operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure manage monitor and report risk exposures which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2014 and 2013 our cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments were 29 billion and 18 billion respectively of which 19 billion and 819 million respectively were denominated in brazilian reais pounds sterling euros or canadian dollars of the 19 billion as of december 31 2014 €969 million 12 billion represents eurodenominated cash that was placed in term deposits at various banks with a maturity date of june 25 2015 to cover the maturity of the nyse euro notes on june 30 2015 see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  debt” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k our investment in cetip which is recorded as an availableforsale longterm investment and was recorded in and is held in brazilian reais was valued at 379 million as of december 31 2014 including an unrealized gain of 55 million changes in the fair value of the cetip investment is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and do not impact earnings except to the extent that unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary the remaining investments are denominated in us dollars we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes a hypothetical decrease in longterm interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pretax earnings by 3 million as of december 31 2014 assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments 

as of december 31 2014 we had 43 billion in outstanding debt of which 14 billion relates to the senior notes and 20 billion relates to the nyse notes both of which bear interest at fixed interest rates the remaining amount outstanding of 905 million relates to the commercial paper program which bears interest at fluctuating rates and therefore subjects us to interest rate risk a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31 2014 would decrease annual pretax earnings by 9 million assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently reset on a daily weekly or monthly basis see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  debt” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as an international business we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses are recorded in euros or pounds sterling certain assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries 

our exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the year ended december 31 2014 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table in millions except average rates and percentages 

 nyse which we acquired in november 2013 has a significant part of its assets liabilities revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros for the year ended december 31 2014 19 of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros and 18 of our consolidated expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros respectively these percentages do not include the euronext revenues and expenses as they are included in discontinued operations as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes the us equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly 

we have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables that occur through our operations which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods we had foreign currency transaction losses of 2 million 2 million and 4 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar which strengthened a 10 adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2014 would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of 6 million assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity 

we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 as economic hedges to hedge a portion of our foreign currency transaction exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure 

we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using a current rate of exchange with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account a component of equity our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below in millions 



the nyse eur notes of €920 million 11 billion no longer constitute a partial hedge of nyse’s net euro investment in foreign entities following the ipo of euronext the transaction gain or loss from the revaluation of the nyse eur notes on the us dollar balance sheet of nyse holdings llc will be offset by the transaction gain or loss from the cash held in euros to repay the notes upon their maturity in june 2015 as discussed above 

as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive income from foreign currency translation was 13 million and 143 million respectively as of december 31 2014 we had net exposure of euro and pounds sterling of €601 million 731 million and £21 billion 32 billion respectively based on december 31 2014 net currency positions a hypothetical 10 decrease of euro against us dollar would negatively impact our equity by 73 million and a hypothetical 10 decrease of pound sterling against us dollar would negatively impact our equity by 325 million for the year ended december 31 2014 currency exchange rate differences had a negative impact of 130 million on our consolidated equity 

credit risk 

we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments wellcapitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties 

an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties our policies require diversification of counterparties banks financial institutions bond issuers and funds so as to avoid a concentration of risk 

clearing house cash deposits credit risk 

our clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are invested primarily to provide security of capital but also which may generate interest income for our clearing members refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for more information on the clearing houses cash deposits which were 475 billion as of december 31 2014 the following is a summary of the risks associated with this investment activity and how these risks are mitigated 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of the purchased security to decline if we were required to sell the security prior to its maturity and interest rates had risen the sale of the security might be made at a loss relative to its original purchase price our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making all of our cash deposit investments in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within 1 to 37 days our clearing house investment guidelines require that a minimum of 50 of clearing member cash deposits are invested in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within one business day efforts are made to invest the remaining 50 in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within 37 business days if this is not possible our policy allows for the investment of up to 50 of clearing member cash deposits in high quality sovereign debt for example us treasury securities and supranational debt instruments euro cash deposits only with the shortest possible time to maturity provided that no such direct investment in a sovereign debt or supranational instrument will have a time to maturity greater than 397 days 109 years 

security issuer risk 

security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures this risk is mitigated by investing clearing member cash deposits in high quality sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements or direct investments in high quality sovereign and supranational debt issues thus the risk is mitigated because in the event of a security issuer default we are left with a highly marketable liquid security 

investment counterparty risk 

investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty or an investment adviser might become insolvent and thus fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and investment advisors 

when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts that are under the control of our clearing house additionally the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2 of the reverse repurchase amount thus in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty’s obligation to our clearing house 

our clearing houses do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments with any of our investment advisors our clearing house property is held in custody accounts controlled by our clearing houses our clearing houses property is 

held with credit worthy custodians which include jpmorgan chase bank na citibank na bny mellon bmo harris na and euroclear bank brussels for nonus dollar deposits 

each clearing house employs or will employ multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event that a single investment adviser or custodian becomes unable to fulfill its role additional investment advisors or custodians are available as backups    

crosscurrency margin deposit risk 

each of our clearing houses pursuant to their rules may permit posting of crosscurrency collateral to satisfy margin requirements for example accepting original margin deposits denominated in us dollars to secure a japanese yen variation margin obligation the risk exists that the value of the original margin currency provided to satisfy margin obligations declines in value resulting in an inability to make required variation margins in the appropriate currency this risk is mitigated by applying a “haircut” to the original margin currency at a level sufficiently high enough to weather periods of high currency volatility crosscurrency balances are markedtomarket on a daily basis should the value of the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value the clearing member is required to increase its original margin deposit on a sameday basis 

impact of inflation 

we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or to decline in the event of inflation we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants as the prices that we charge are not governed by longterm contracts

clearing services 

we operate the following six clearing houses 

 our clearing houses clear settle and guarantee the financial performance of futures contracts and options on futures contracts and in some cases swap instruments ice clear europe also clears european cds instruments and ice clear credit clears north american european and emerging market cds instruments through each of our clearing houses we maintain a system for the performance of financial obligations for the products we clear these financial obligations are between the clearing members through which buyers and sellers conduct transactions this system is supported by several mechanisms including rigorous clearing membership requirements the calculation and posting of original margin deposits daily marktomarket of positions and payment of variation margin maintenance of guaranty funds in which clearing members maintain deposits with our clearing houses and broad assessment powers to recoup financial losses should they arise due to a clearing member default the amount of margin deposits on hand fluctuates over time as a result of among other things the extent of open positions held at any point in time by market participants and the volatility of the market as reflected in the applicable margin rates for such contracts 

to ensure performance our clearing houses maintain extensive technology and quantitative risk management systems as well as financial and operational requirements for clearing members and minimum margin requirements for our cleared products our clearing houses use software based on industry standard margining conventions and on our proprietary models uniquely customized to our products to determine the appropriate margin requirements for each clearing member by simulating the maximum possible gains and losses of complex portfolios based on price movements 

for each daily settlement cycle our clearing houses marktomarket or value all open positions at the prevailing market price and require payments from clearing members whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing members whose positions have gained value our clearing houses marktomarket all open positions at least once per day and in some cases more often if market volatility warrants or on a near realtime basis markingtomarket provides both participants in a transaction with an accounting of their financial obligations under the contract ice clear europe uses an intraday risk management methodology based on realtime price and trade data feeds from our futures and options markets the methodology provides calculations of original margin and realized and unrealized variation margin and fully revalues all positions at regular intervals throughout the day trade position profit and loss reports are available to ice clear us throughout the trading day thereby substantially reducing intraday price risk marktomarket allows our clearing houses to identify any clearing members that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing houses to ensure financial performance of their open positions the clearing houses may make multiple intraday original margin calls in circumstances where market conditions require that they take additional steps to protect the clearing house 

our clearing houses have an excellent track record of risk management ice clear europe ice clear us ice clear canada ice clear credit and tcc have never experienced an incident of a clearing member default which has required the use of the guaranty funds of nondefaulting members or the assets of the clearing house nevertheless we have extensive risk management procedures in place to ensure we protect the interests of our clearing members and clearing houses 

each of our clearing houses has instituted multilayered risk management system of rules policies and procedures to protect itself in the event of a clearing member default in addition each of our clearing houses engages in the following activities as part of our clearing risk management systems 

 in the event of a payment default by a clearing member the applicable clearing house would follow the default procedures specified in the rules of that clearing house in general the clearing houses would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing member to cover its payment obligation these assets include original margin variation margin positions held at the clearing house and guaranty fund deposits of the clearing member in addition the clearing houses could make a demand for payment pursuant to any available guarantee provided to the clearing houses by the parent or affiliate of the defaulting clearing member thereafter if the defaulted payment obligation remains unsatisfied the clearing houses would use the guaranty fund contributions of other clearing members and us as applicable and funds collected through an assessment against all other nondefaulting clearing members and in some cases us to satisfy the deficit as part of the powers and procedures designed to backstop financial obligations in the event of a default each of our clearing houses may levy assessments on all of their clearing members if there are insufficient funds available to cover a deficit following the depletion of all assets in the guaranty fund prior to such assessment 

we offer clearing services for the cds markets through ice clear europe in a risk management framework that is separate from our futures and options or noncds clearing operations we also offer clearing services for cds markets through ice clear credit both cds clearing houses are openaccess pursuant to regulatory requirements and therefore accept qualifying trades for clearing that are executed on other venues we have established separate cds risk pools for ice clear credit and ice clear europe including separate guaranty funds and margin accounts meaning that the cds positions are not combined with positions in our traditional futures and options clearing houses the cds clearing houses have risk management systems that are designed specifically for cds instruments and have independent governance structures as of december 31 2013 our cds clearing houses clear 288 single name instruments and 110 cds indexes 

we have also committed 303 million in borrowing capacity under our credit facilities to assist our clearing houses with liquidity that may be needed to both operate and manage a default during a time of financial stress see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources in this annual report on form 10k 

ice clear credit and ice clear us currently selfmanage the cash that their respective clearing members leave on deposit to satisfy original margin and guaranty fund requirements ice clear europe currently uses jpmorgan chase bank na and citibank na for investment activity of their clearing member cash deposits 

on july 18 2012 the financial stability oversight council designated ice clear credit as a systemically important financial market utility under title viii of the doddfrank act

  our competitive strengths and competition 

competitive strengths 

we are a leading operator of global equities options and futures exchanges derivative clearing houses and posttrade services we operate leading markets in the asset classes in which we compete including cash equities equity options futures and many otc markets we believe our key strengths include our 

 many of our futures contracts serve as global benchmarks for managing risk relating to exposure to price movements in the underlying products including financial energy and agricultural commodities for example we operate the leading market for trading in brent crude oil futures as measured by the volume of contracts traded in 2013 according to the futures industry association the ice brent crude futures contract is the leading benchmark for pricing light sweet crude oil produced and consumed outside of the united states the ice brent crude futures contract is part of the brent complex which forms the price

we offer a range of central clearing and related risk management services to promote the security of our markets the credit and performance assurance provided by our clearing houses to clearing members substantially reduces counterparty risk and is a critical component of our exchanges’ identities as reliable and secure marketplaces for global transactions we believe the services offered by our clearing houses are a competitive advantage and attract market participants to our exchanges our clearing houses are designed to protect the financial integrity of our markets by maintaining collateral facilitating payments and collections enhancing capital efficiency and limiting counterparty credit risk 

we operate the leading global listings and trading venues for equities and offer our customers access to the capital markets in the united states and europe our various listing venues allow companies to list domestic and international equity securities corporate structured products convertible bonds trackers and debt securities in 2013 nyse was the global leader in ipos for the third consecutive year raising 59 billion in total proceeds including leading in technology company ipos during the same period nyse was the leader in followon financings raising 176 billion in proceeds through our european exchanges a total of €85 billion was raised from initial and secondary offerings including bond offerings

competition 

the markets in which we operate are global and highly competitive we face competition in all aspects of our business from a number of different enterprises both domestic and international including traditional exchanges electronic trading platforms and voice brokers prior to the passage of the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 or cfma futures trading was generally required to take place on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market the costs and difficulty of obtaining contract market designation and corresponding regulatory requirements created significant barriers to entry for competing exchanges the cfma and changing market dynamics including electronic trading have led to increased competition from a number of different domestic and international sources of varied size business objectives and resources 

we believe we compete on the basis of a number of factors including 

 19 

 we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that our deep liquid markets breadth of product offerings new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to develop new and innovative products and services enhance our technology infrastructure maintain liquidity and offer competitive transaction costs 

the financial services segment is highly competitive with competition increasing as markets have globalized and following the implementation of financial reform regulation certain competitors include exchanges that replicate our futures contracts for example cme group the largest derivatives exchange in the united states with 86 market share of all us futures contracts traded competes with our exchanges on agricultural and energy commodities currency and equity index contracts nyse liffe and nyse liffe us compete with the otc markets as well as a number of international derivatives exchanges including the cme eurex which is the derivatives platform operated by deutsche börse and nlx which is the derivative platform operated by nasdaq 

we compete with voice brokers active in certain of the otc energy and credit derivatives markets other electronic trading platforms for derivatives clearing houses and market data vendors ice swap trade creditex and creditex brokerage compete with other swap execution facilities and large interdealer brokers in the credit derivatives market 

  in addition to competition from derivative exchanges that offer commodity products we also face competition from other exchanges electronic trading systems thirdparty clearing houses futures commission merchants and technology firms further certain financial services or technology companies have entered the otc trade execution services market additional joint ventures and consortia could form or have been formed to provide services that could potentially compete with certain services that we provide 

in the united states we face significant competition with respect to cash trading and this competition is expected to remain intense our current and prospective competitors include regulated markets electronic communication networks dark pools and other alternative trading systems market makers and other execution venues the recently announced proposed combination of bats global markets inc and direct edge llc may increase competitive pressures we also face growing competition from large brokers and customers that may assume the role of principal and act as counterparty to orders originating from retail customers or by matching their respective order flows through bilateral trading arrangements including through internalization of order flow some of these competitors are among our largest customers or are owned by our customers in particular many of our key customers are prioritizing their internalization and alternative trading system businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business 

in the united states our principal competitor for listings is nasdaq omx group inc or nasdaq omx the us capital markets face competition for foreign issuer listings from a number of stock exchanges outside the united states including london stock exchange plc deutsche börse group and exchanges in tokyo hong kong toronto singapore and australia as other liquidity venues seek exchange status we may face more competition for listings 

nyse arca and nyse amex options face considerable competition in equity derivatives trading their principal us competitors are the chicago board options exchange inc or cboe the international securities exchange holdings inc bats global markets inc or bats the boston options exchange group llc and the nasdaq omx as well as startups such as miami international securities exchange llc and elx futures lp backed by a consortium of banks and other market participants

regulation 

we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory agencies in the united states europe asia and canada in 2009 during the pittsburgh summit the g20 nations came to a mutual agreement on global financial market reform since that agreement various domestic and foreign governments have undertaken reviews of the existing legal framework governing financial markets and have either passed new laws and regulations or are in the process of debating andor enacting new laws and regulations that apply to our business 

in 2010 the us congress passed the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the doddfrank act through extensive rulemaking authority granted under the doddfrank act the cftc and sec are charged with creating a comprehensive new regulatory regime governing otc derivative markets and market participants including our otc markets and customers doddfrank requires among other things mandatory exchange trading clearing and reporting of otc derivatives and greater regulation of exchanges and clearing houses the european union has also adopted new legislation on otc derivatives clearing houses and trade repositories commonly known as the european market infrastructure regulation or emir emir requires among other things otc and exchangetraded derivatives trades to be reported to trade repositories clearing of standardized otc derivative contracts and more stringent prudential operational and business requirements for clearing houses the final form of the legislation was enacted in august 2012 and secondary legislation to enact the legislation became effective on 

march 15 2013 in addition the european union is finalizing markets in financial instruments directives ii or mifid ii which requires position limits for commodity derivatives and requires open access for european derivatives markets 

in november 2013 we finalized our acquisition of nyse euronext as detailed below the acquisition adds new regulated businesses to our operations including a number of european and us equity exchanges and as explained in further detail below under equities regulation subjects us to oversight by additional regulators 

we believe that many of the new requirements of the doddfrank act and emir are consistent with the manner in which we already operated our business for example new requirements to centrally clear otc swaps and trade them on regulated platforms are consistent with our existing business model the mandate to clear standardized swaps complements our clearing businesses operating in three countries while certain of these changes may have a positive impact on our business some changes could adversely affect our business please refer to the discussion below and to the “risk factors” section for a description of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertainties 

derivatives regulation 

trade execution 

over the past three years the cftc has issued new rules to implement the doddfrank act as a result of the doddfrank act we reorganized our us derivatives business we transitioned the majority of our otc energy products into futures listed on ice futures us our natural gas emissions and electricity products and ice futures europe oil natural gas freight and iron ore products in october 2013 the cftc granted our subsidiary ice swap trade temporary registration as a sef as the final part of our doddfrank act transition we listed our bilateral energy swaps products and credit derivatives on ice swap trade we still offer physically settled bilateral energy contracts for forward delivery on our otc platform although we have brought our operations into compliance with the doddfrank act there can be no guarantee that our business and trading volumes will not be adversely affected as a result of our compliance with these requirements 

our us futures contracts are listed on ice futures us which is subject to extensive regulation by the cftc under the commodity exchange act or cea the cea generally requires that futures trading in the united states be conducted on a commodity exchange registered as a designated contract market or dcm as a registered dcm ice futures us is a selfregulatory organization that has instituted rules and procedures to comply with the core principles applicable to it under the commodity exchange act ice futures us also has surveillance and compliance operations and procedures to monitor and enforce compliance with its rules and ice futures us is periodically audited by the cftc with respect to the fulfillment of its selfregulatory programs in these areas our us swaps business is listed on ice swap trade which is regulated as a sef by the cftc like registered dcms sefs are selfregulated organizations that must comply with core principles that are similar to the dcm core principles the cost of regulatory compliance for dcms and sefs is substantial in addition the increased regulation of derivatives transactions could result in reduced trading activity which could adversely affect our business 

the regulatory framework applicable to ice futures us and ice swap trade is supplemented by the cea which has provisions regulating the conduct of participants in the regulated market importantly the cea contains provisions making it an offense for participants to engage in certain market behavior such as market manipulation and prohibits market abuse breaches of those provisions give rise to the risk of sanctions including financial or criminal penalties in addition many market participants including clearing firms must independently register with the cftc and national futures association and perform various compliance and reporting functions 

in november 2013 the cftc proposed new rules placing position limits on 28 energy metals and agricultural contracts ice futures us has spot month position limits for its energy and agricultural products and for certain agricultural and financial contracts all month limits if finalized the new rules will place federal all month and spot month limits on these 28 contracts and the limits will be aggregated across exchanges and the otc swaps markets key contracts included in the rule will be the henry hub natural gas contract and the ice wti crude oil contract financially settled contracts including our henry hub natural gas and wti contracts will maintain a position limit five times the limit for physically settled futures contracts if the cftcs position limits were to be imposed in the form proposed trading activity and liquidity on our exchanges may decline which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in january 2014 the federal reserve announced that it is reviewing its policy allowing banks to participate in the physical commodity markets while the review is at an early stage if the federal reserve decides to limit bank participation in the physical commodity markets it could cause additional banks to sell certain of their commodity operations in the united kingdom ice futures europe is a recognized investment exchange in accordance with the financial services and markets act 2000 or fsma

the regulatory framework applicable to our regulated exchanges is supplemented by legislation and rules such as the commodity exchange act in the us or mifid in europe which regulate the conduct of participants in the regulated market importantly these legislative or regulatory frameworks contain provisions making it an offense for participants to engage in certain market behavior such as market manipulation and prohibits market abuse breaches of those provisions give rise to the risk of sanctions including financial andor criminal penalties in addition many market participants including clearing firms must independently register with their applicable regulators and industry self regulatory organization such as the national futures association and perform various compliance and reporting functions 

clearing 

ice clear credit ice clear us and tcc are regulated by the cftc as dcos ice clear europe which is primarily regulated in the united kingdom is also subject to regulation by the cftc as a dco both ice clear credit and ice clear europe are also regulated by the sec as clearing agencies because they clear securitybased swaps dcos are subject to extensive regulation by the cftc under the commodity exchange act as part of our acquisition of nyse euronext we now own new york portfolio clearing or nypc a dco subject to regulatory approval we plan to move nypc’s clearing business to ice clear us and ice clear europe 

ice clear europe is primarily regulated by the bank of england as a recognized clearing house or rch as required by emir which came into force on march 15 2013 ice clear europe presented an application to esma to be authorized under emir within the required timeframe emir also requires clearing houses to require original margin to cover an exchange traded derivatives futures position for two days which could increase margin requirements for market participants and could make trading of cleared derivative contracts in europe less attractive for market participants on september 1 2013 esma made its recommendation to the european commission over whether the united states and other countries financial regulatory systems are equivalent to the european financial regulatory system in its recommendation esma stated that in regards to clearing house regulation the us regulatory system is not equivalent to the european financial regulatory system however esma did state that clearing houses could adopt rules including the increased margin requirements mentioned above and receive recognition as a foreign clearing house from esma if a foreign clearing does not obtain recognition european customer access to that clearing house will be more difficult and expensive ice clear credit ice clear us and ice clear canada have applied for recognition as foreign clearing houses with esma 

in 2012 the international organization of securities commissions issued principles for financial market infrastructures or pfmi clearing houses that adhere to the rules of their local regulator designed to meet the pfmis can be deemed to be a qualified central counter party or qccp generally global banking regulators give favorable capital treatment to banks that clear at qccps for example the us banking agencies the federal reserve the office of the comptroller of currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation issued final rules implementing the basel iii accord to encourage central clearing the final rules assess a relatively low risk weight of either 2 or 4 to a bank’s exposure to cleared derivatives held in a qccp ice clear credit as a systemically important financial market utility under title viii of the doddfrank act is deemed a qccp by us banking regulators ice clear europe ice clear us and ice clear canada adhere to the rules of their local regulator designed to meet the international standards set forth in the pfmis and accordingly retain their status as qccps smxcc is regulated by the monetary authority of singapore as a designated clearing house we plan to seek qccp status for smxcc 

  historically clearing houses and the cftc have treated us treasuries as liquid for collateral purposes however as part of the qccp recognition process the cftc passed regulation 3933 requiring us treasuries to be subject to a “prearranged” and “highly reliable” same day funding arrangement in order for us treasuries to qualify as being liquid for collateral purposes subsequent to the adoption of cftc regulation 3933 cftc staff provided informal guidance that the only way to demonstrate “prearranged” and “highly reliable” is by requiring a “committed” funding arrangement the cost of obtaining the necessary amount of committed facilities combined with clearing house changes to the composition of the collateral it accepts in order to meet liquidity requirements may be substantial 

trade reporting 

a key aspect of the g20 financial reform efforts is the reporting of derivatives trades to trade repositories in the united states all swaps must be reported to swap data repositories or sdrs in june 2012 the cftc provisionally registered ice trade vault as a sdr for the credit and commodity asset classes in europe emir requires all derivatives trades futures or swaps to be reported to a trade repository in november 2013 esma approved ice trade vault europe as a trade repository in advance of emir’s trade reporting deadline in february 2014 we will continue to seek approvals to serve as a trade repository as other jurisdictions finalize their reporting rules 

equities regulation 

trade execution 

us federal securities laws have established a twotiered system for the regulation of securities markets and market participants the first tier consists of the sec which has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws and regulations and is subject to congressional oversight the second tier consists of the regulatory responsibilities of selfregulatory organizations or sros over their members sros are nongovernmental entities that are registered with and regulated by the sec 

securities industry sros are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the securities exchange act of 1934 exchange act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors to be a registered national securities exchange an exchange must be able to carry out and comply with the purposes of the exchange act and the rules and regulations under the exchange act in addition as an sro an exchange must be able to enforce compliance by its members and individuals associated with its members with the provisions of the exchange act and its own rules finally the legislative regulatory framework applicable to securities industry sros has provisions regulating the conduct of participants in the regulated market importantly the cea contains provisions making it an offense for participants to engage in certain market behavior such as insider trading market manipulation and market abuse breaches of those provisions give rise to the risk of sanctions including financial or criminal penalties

 item 1a risk factors   

you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect our company in the future if any of the risks discussed below actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our business and operating results depend in large part on volatility in the prices and interest rates underlying our derivative products and may be adversely impacted by domestic and international economic and market conditions 

participants in the markets for our products including energy and agricultural commodities financial and equity derivatives and other securities trade pursuant to a range of trading strategies trading volume is driven primarily by the degree of volatility  the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations  in prices and interest rates of the underlying commodities indices benchmarks or other measures volatility increases the need to hedge contractual price risk and creates opportunities for speculative or arbitrage trading were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices of the underlying commodities indices benchmarks or other measures of our derivative products we could experience lower trading volumes slower growth or declines in revenues 

factors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility and thus trading volumes and our operating results include 

 any one or more of these factors may reduce trading activity which could make our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which in turn could further discourage existing and potential market participants and thus accelerate a decline in the level of trading activity in these markets a significant decline in our trading volumes could have a material adverse effect on our transactionbased revenues and the demand for our market data moreover if these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets could be jeopardized because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our current products and services decline for any reason we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues and our net income will decline 

the conditions in global financial markets and new laws and regulations as a result of such conditions may adversely affect our trading volumes and market liquidity 

a significant portion of our consolidated revenues are derived from fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets and from the provision of electronic trade confirmation services we derived 84 87 and 89 of our consolidated revenues from our transactionbased business for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively on a pro forma basis giving effect to our acquisition of nyse euronext as if it had occurred on january 1 2011 we would have derived 60 60 and 63 of our consolidated revenues from our transactionbased business for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively in particular we derive a significant percentage of the consolidated revenues from our transactionbased business from trading in ice brent crude futures and options contracts north american natural gas futures and options contracts and subsequent to our acquisition of nyse euronext short term interest rates contracts including the euribor and short sterling futures and options contracts consequently declines in trading volumes and market liquidity generally or in our ice brent crude north american natural gas or short term interest rates futures and options contracts in particular would adversely affect our business and profitability the trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of trading activity for any reason including the factors referenced above that impact volatility or other factors such as 

 a reduction in our overall trading volume could also render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenues further a reduction in trading volumes would likely result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for our market data that would reduce our overall revenue 

our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to increased legislation and regulatory scrutiny and we face the risk of changes to this regulatory environment and business in the future which may reduce our trading and clearing volumes or increase our cost of doing business 

as an owner and operator of regulated exchanges and clearing houses for the global financial and commodity markets we are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions around the world and in particular in the united states and united kingdom where the largest portions of our operations are conducted we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments among other things as a result of regulators enforcing existing laws and regulations we could be censured fined prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees in many cases our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions 

there is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or those of our clients including access to our markets and capital liquidity and margin requirements could be imposed which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or which may impact our clients’ overall trading volume through our exchanges and demand for our market data and other services in addition regulation imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally such as the proposed proprietary trading restrictions for certain banking organizations in both the us and europe could adversely impact levels of market activity and price volatility more broadly and thus impact our businesses 

these developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other locations including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our stockholders and creditors in addition certain developments could increase our liability for performing our 

oversight requirements for example in august 2013 the securities industry and financial market association or sifma asked the sec to review the sro structure of the securities markets and protections sros have against liability in performing their oversight functions in its letter sifma stated that forprofit exchanges compete with the broker dealers they regulate which sifma argues undercuts the regulatory authority of exchanges the sec has not announced any review of the sro structure in response to sifmas request the sec has also indicated an intent to undertake a broad review of the equities market structure the outcome of which we cannot predict   

us and european legal and regulatory developments in response to the global financial crisis in particular the us doddfrank act emir and mifid ii have significantly altered the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability among the aspects of these recently enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes most likely to affect our businesses are mifid ii’s open access requirements mifid ii’s benchmark access requirements the cftc’s proposed rules limiting aggregate positions for energy and agricultural products across exchanges in the spot month and across all months commodity position limit rules in europe a proposal by the federal reserve to limit bank participation in the physical commodity business and emir’s rule requiring clearing houses use a two day holding period in the calculation of initial margin in addition as the operator of a global business the lack of harmonization in international financial reform efforts could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in multiple jurisdictions other enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability 

please see “item 1  business  regulation” above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations 

we face intense competition that could materially and adversely affect our business 

we face intense competition in all aspects of our business we believe competition in our businesses is based on a number of important factors including but not limited to market liquidity transparency technology advancements platform speed and reliability regulatory differences new and existing product offerings pricing and risk management capabilities our competitors both domestic and international are numerous we currently compete with 

 trends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings in our equities business the recently announced proposed combination of bats global markets inc and direct edge llc may increase competitive pressures further a regional exchange in an emerging market country such as brazil india or china or a producer country could attract enough trading activity to compete with our benchmark products finally many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and alternative trading system businesses ahead of their exchangebased market making business 

a decline in our fees due to competitive pressure the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers if we are not able to compete successfully our business could be materially impacted including our ability to sustain as an operating entity 

in our listings business the legal and regulatory environment in the united states and the market perceptions about that environment may make it difficult for our us equity exchanges to compete with nonus equity exchanges for listings for example negative perceptions regarding compliance costs associated with adherence to corporate governance requirements have and may continue to discourage future listings on us equity exchanges by both us and foreign private issuers any failure by our equity exchanges to successfully compete for any reason could adversely impact our revenue derived from listing fees and the associated trading execution and market data fees 

we may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our acquisition of nyse euronext 

the success of our acquisition of nyse euronext will depend in part on our ability to realize anticipated cost savings revenue synergies and growth opportunities we expect to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies specifically we expect to achieve cost savings of approximately 500 million within the three years following the acquisition we have set an aggressive timeline for realizing these cost savings resulting from the acquisition with approximately 70 of these cost savings expected to be achieved at a runrate level by the fourth quarter of 2014 and more than 90 synergy achievement by the end of 2015 which assumes we successfully separate nyse liffe from euronext divest portions of the nyse technologies business integrate technology eliminate redundancies and effect an organizational restructuring all of which are subject to a variety of risks and certain of which are subject to regulatory approvals that we do not control we also expect to achieve revenue synergies from the acquisition in our clearing business and the development of new products although we may not be successful 

there is a risk however that we may not integrate nyse euronext in a manner that permits these costs savings and revenue synergies to be realized in the time currently expected or at all in addition a variety of factors including but not limited to regulatory conditions or delay or requirements related to the euronext ipo currency fluctuations and difficulty integrating technology platforms may adversely affect our anticipated cost savings and synergies also we must achieve the anticipated cost savings without adversely affecting our revenues if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

we may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from mergers and acquisitions strategic joint ventures or investments which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

the success of our mergers and acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated expense synergies integration success and growth opportunities as well as revenue growth trends in general we expect to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies however the process of integration may disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties including inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants regulators and others require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business as a result we may not successfully achieve the integration objectives from any particular merger or acquisition and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings revenue growth and synergies in full or at all or it may take longer to realize them than expected 

we may also not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures that we have entered into or may enter into in the future for a number of reasons including regulatory or government approvals or changes global market changes contractual obligations competing products and in some instances our lack of or limited control over the management of the business further strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future 

we may not be able to complete an ipo of euronext 

we plan to separate the businesses of euronext and liffe and to transition all of liffe’s business to ice’s exchanges clearing houses and trading platform in order to establish euronext as an independent business we are currently pursuing an ipo of euronext which is expected in the second quarter of 2014 there are significant risks and uncertainties associated with the potential ipo of euronext and the transition of liffe’s business including required regulatory approvals and requirements and potential unforeseen uncertainties and delays we may also be unable to sell the euronext businesses at a desirable price may not be able to complete the transaction on a desirable timeline or may incur higher than anticipated expenses related to the transaction whether or not the ipo of euronext is successful the process of accomplishing the transaction may result in increased general and administrative expenses and divert management’s time and attention from other business concerns realizing the benefits of the 

potential ipo of euronext will depend in part on our ability to separate certain of euronext’s businesses in an efficient and effective manner while maintaining adequate focus on its retained businesses 

in addition separation of the euronext businesses is subject to regulatory approval by the individual regulators of euronexts businesses regulatory approval will be conditioned on the assumption by euronext of certain undertakings to regulators and adoption of provisions in its constitutional documents satisfactory to regulators as well as the assumption by us of undertakings in relation to our potential role as a large shareholder in euronext following any ipo regulatory approval for a separation of the euronext businesses may not be forthcoming or it may be granted subject to conditions that are not acceptable to us or that might make an ipo difficult to execute our inability to complete the ipo or our agreement to any regulatory commitments and constraints following an ipo may make it difficult for us to achieve adequate returns on our holding in euronext which could also negatively impact our credit ratings and our ability to reduce our debt 

we intend to continue offering new products and to explore acquisition opportunities and strategic alliances relating to other businesses products or technologies which will involve risks we may not be successful in offering new products or identifying opportunities 

we intend to launch new products and continue to explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may spend substantial time and money developing new product offerings or improving current product offerings if these product offerings are not successful we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to offset the costs of such initiatives we may also enter into business combination transactions make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures or alliances any of which may be material and will involve risks further we may enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry attracting customers in certain countries may also be subject to a number of risks including currency exchange rate risk difficulties in enforcing agreements or collecting receivables longer payment cycles compliance with the laws or regulations of these countries and political and regulatory uncertainties 

in addition in light of consolidation in the exchange and clearing sector and competition for opportunities we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully our competitors could merge making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors if we are required to raise capital by incurring additional debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment we cannot assure you that any such financing will be available or that the terms of such financing or equity offering will be favorable to us 

also offering new products and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives as a result of any future acquisition we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute shareholders’ ownership interest in us expend cash incur debt assume contingent liabilities inherit existing or pending litigation or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets with estimable useful lives any of which could harm our business financial condition or results of operations and negatively impact our stock price 

owning clearing houses exposes us to risks including the risk of defaults by clearing members clearing trades through our clearing houses risks regarding investing the funds in the guaranty fund and held as security for original margin and risks related to the cost of operating the clearing houses 

operating clearing houses requires material ongoing expenditures and exposes us to various risks there are risks inherent in operating a clearing house including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members defaults by clearing members and risks associated with investing collateral provided by clearing members to our clearing houses which could subject our business to substantial losses for example clearing members have placed an aggregate amount of cash in ice clear europe relating to margin requirements and funding the guaranty funds of 245 billion as of december 31 2013 and a total of 422 billion for all of our clearing houses as of december 31 2013 for ice clear europe these funds are swept and invested daily by jpmorgan chase bank na and citibank na in accordance with our clearing house investment guidelines ice clear credit and ice clear us currently selfmanage the cash that their clearing members leave on deposit to satisfy their respective original margin and guaranty fund requirements during the first and second quarters of 2014 both ice clear credit and ice clear us expect to transition to the use of external investment advisors for the investment activity associated with the clearing member cash deposits 

our clearing houses have an obligation to return margin payments and guaranty fund contributions to clearing members once the relevant clearing member’s exposure to the clearing house no longer exists if the number of large wellcapitalized banks that 

are clearing members decreases the concentration of risks within our clearing houses will be spread among a smaller pool of clearing members which makes it more difficult to absorb and manage risk in the event of a clearing members default 

although our clearing houses have policies and procedures to help ensure that clearing members can satisfy their obligations such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a counterparty’s default in addition the process for deriving margins and financial safeguards for our trading activity is complex especially for cds products and although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect us from the risks of clearing these products we cannot assure you that these measures and safeguards will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default we have contributed our own capital to the guaranty fund of the clearing houses that could be used in the event of a default where the defaulting clearing participant’s margins the defaulting clearing participant’s guaranty fund contributions and nondefaulting clients net funds of the clearing participant are not sufficient to cover the default furthermore the default of any one of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and cause our customers to lose confidence in the guarantee of our clearing houses 

our clearing houses hold substantial amounts of funds and sovereign and government guaranteed agency debt securities as collateral for original margin and guaranty fund deposits a decline in the value of these securities or default by a sovereign government could subject our clearing houses to additional risks of default by their clearing members or the value of the sovereign treasury securities held by our clearing houses may be insufficient 

our clearing houses hold a substantial amount of client assets as collateral which comprise us and other sovereign treasury securities as of december 31 2013 our clearing houses held 259 billion of noncash collateral 159 billion of this amount was comprised of us treasury securities 22 billion was comprised of german treasury securities 13 billion was comprised of french treasury securities 10 billion was comprised of uk treasury securities and 40 billion was comprised of other european and canadian treasury securities sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived credit worthiness of major governments but the markets for such treasury securities have experienced significant volatility recently our clearing houses apply a discount or haircut to the market values for all sovereign securities held as collateral the markets for such treasury securities have experienced significant volatility recently related to ongoing financial challenges in some of the major european countries and leading up to the us government’s negotiations regarding tax increases spending cuts and raising the debt ceiling which is the maximum amount of debt that the us government can legally incur in addition if there is a collapse of the euro our clearing houses would face significant expenses in changing their systems and such an event could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates 

notwithstanding the current intraday margin and valuation checks conducted by our clearing houses our clearing houses will need to continue to monitor the volatility and value of us and other sovereign treasury securities because if the value of these treasury securities declines significantly our clearing houses will need to collect additional collateral from their clearing members which may be difficult for the clearing members to supply in the event of a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government in addition our clearing houses may be required to impose a more significant discount on the value of sovereign treasury securities posted as collateral if there is uncertainty regarding the future value of these securities which would trigger the need for additional collateral contributions by the clearing members if a clearing member cannot supply the additional collateral which may include cash deposits in a currency acceptable to the clearing house the clearing house would deem the clearing member in default if any clearing members default as a result of the reduction in value of their collateral our clearing houses and trading business could suffer substantial losses as a result of the loss of our own capital that has been contributed to the clearing house’s guaranty fund a reduction in the volume of cleared transactions and a loss of confidence by clearing members in the guaranty of the clearing houses 

further our clearing houses invest large sums of money through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and may hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions our clearing houses may make time deposits with banks that are secured only to the value of fdic insurance and therefore if the us government defaults on its debt obligations our deposits may in significant part be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent our clearing houses that utilize time deposits currently manage such exposure by limiting the counterparties with which time deposits are made and the value of such loans however such limits may not be feasible in the event of a significant shortfall in available security for loans as a result of a potential default by the us government in such event our clearing houses may make time deposits with lesser credit worthy counterparties or increase the loan size limit for existing counterparties which leads to more risks with respect to the funds held by the clearing houses and could lead to substantial losses 

owning and operating exchanges exposes us to risks including the regulatory responsibilities these businesses must conduct under applicable law 

in addition to the risks we had operating various derivatives exchanges prior to our acquisition of nyse euronext we now own and operate equity exchanges which exposes us to additional risks revenues from our equity exchanges are primarily derived from listing fees trading activity and demand for related market data adverse economic conditions and regulatory changes similar to those discussed above could result in decreased trading volume discourage market participants from listing on our equity exchanges or cause market participants to reduce the size of new offerings listed on our equity exchanges any of these could reduce our revenues including the market data revenue we generate from providing market data which is determined based on trading volume and from listing fees 

in addition our exchanges are operated as forprofit businesses but under applicable law have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled any failure by one of our exchanges with selfregulatory responsibility to diligently and fairly regulate its member organizations ensure market compliance or to otherwise fulfill its regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation prompt regulatory scrutiny and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in particular nyse regulation our wholly owned notforprofit indirect subsidiary oversees finras performance of market surveillance of our secregulated us exchanges and related enforcement activities enforces listed company compliance with applicable standards oversees regulatory policy determinations rule interpretation and regulationrelated rule development and conducts limited realtime trading reviews we must allocate significant resources to fulfill our selfregulatory responsibilities and to finra to perform these functions which limits our ability to reduce our expense structure the forprofit entitys goal of maximizing stockholder value might contradict the exchange’s responsibilities as a regulator of its members users and listed companies conflicts also arise when a company lists its securities on an exchange that it owns the listing of our common stock on the nyse could potentially create a conflict between the exchange’s regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities on the one hand and our commercial and economic interest on the other hand while we have structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful 

our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

our ability to comply with applicable complex and changing laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel while we have policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed regulators periodically review our exchanges’ ability to selfregulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and selfregulatory standards in particular certain of our businesses acquired in the nyse euronext acquisition are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations policies and procedures if we fail to comply with any of these obligations regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business 

in addition our regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which can be significant any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to continue to conduct our business 

the ability of our exchanges to comply with all applicable laws and rules as a selfregulatory organization is largely dependent on our maintenance of compliance surveillance audit and reporting systems we cannot assure you that these systems and procedures are fully effective failure to comply with current or future regulatory requirements could subject us to significant penalties including termination of our ability to conduct our regulated businesses further the implementation of new legislation or regulations or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to operate expand and enhance our electronic platform as necessary to remain competitive and grow our business which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill other intangible assets or investments which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets with respect to our acquisitions and other investments requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2013 we had goodwill of 95 billion and net other 

intangible assets of 94 billion relating to our acquisitions including our acquisition of nyse euronext our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties and the russell licensing agreement we also have 324 million in longterm investments relating to our equity security investment in cetip sa or cetip we recorded a 190 million impairment loss on our investment in cetip during the year ended december 31 2013 primarily due to the devaluation of the brazilian real associated with cetip since the investment in july 2011 for additional information on the cetip impairment refer to note 5 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we assess goodwill other intangible assets and other investments and assets for impairment by applying a fairvalue based test looking at historical performance capital requirements and projected cash flows on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 

we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may result in asset impairments an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill other intangible assets and other investments and assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results for additional information on our goodwill other intangible assets and shortterm investments refer to notes 5 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes and “critical accounting policies  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets” in item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

if we are unable to keep up with rapid changes in technology and participant preferences we may not be able to compete effectively 

to remain competitive we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary technology the financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change change in use patterns change in client preferences frequent product and service introductions and the emergence of new industry standards and practices these changes could render our existing proprietary technology uncompetitive or obsolete our ability to pursue our strategic objectives including increasing trading volumes on our trading platforms as well as our ability to continue to grow our business will depend in part on our ability to 

 we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology to our participants’ requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and costeffective manner any failure to remain abreast of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to participant preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our revenues 

our business may be harmed by computer and communications systems failures and delays 

we support and maintain many of the systems that comprise our electronic platforms our failure to monitor or maintain these systems or to find replacements for defective components within a system in a timely and costeffective manner when necessary could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business although we fully replicate our primary data center our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following 

 36 

 

we could experience system failures due to power or telecommunications failures human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar events if any one or more of these situations were to arise they could result in damage to our business reputation participant dissatisfaction with our electronic platform prompting participants to trade elsewhere or exposure to litigation or regulatory sanctions as a consequence our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 

our regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance 

although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in volume of order and trading transaction traffic and to provide processing and clearing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

our systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks hacking and cyber attacks especially in light of our role in the global financial marketplace which could result in wrongful use of our information or which could make our participants reluctant to use our electronic platform 

we regard the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to continuously transact and clear on our electronic platforms as critical elements of our operations our networks and those of our participants our third party service providers and external market infrastructures may however be vulnerable to unauthorized access fraud computer viruses human error denial of service attacks terrorism firewall or encryption failures and other security problems recently the financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of fraud political protest and activism further former employees of certain companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly 

for example phishing and hacking incidents in europe as reported in the press have resulted in unauthorized transfers of certain affected european union emissions allowances or euas from accounts in various european registries none of which were operated by us the affected euas have been transferred between registry accounts and eventually some affected euas were delivered by clearing members to the clearing house’s registered accounts in the united kingdom pursuant to delivery obligations under relevant ice futures europe contracts further some affected euas were delivered to ice clear europe’s registered accounts in the united kingdom as collateral we are also aware of litigation between some market participants in connection with these stolen certificates and it is possible that we could be joined to such litigation in the future 

although we have not been the victim of cyber attacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cyber security breaches such as distributed denial of service attacks computer malware phishing attempts and other information technology violations that are typical for a company of our size that operates in the global financial marketplace as part of our overall risk management program we operate an internal information security incident management program that is designed to detect and mitigate cyber incidents and that has detected and mitigated such incidents in the past although we intend to implement additional industry standard security measures in the future to the extent necessary to maintain the effectiveness of our information security program we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against attacks losses or reduced trading volume in our markets as a result of any security breach hacking or cyber attack any such attacks could result in reputational damage could cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose customers could cause us to experience lower current and future trading volumes or incur significant liabilities or could have a negative impact on our competitive position additionally current and future security measures may involve significant expenses to purchase and maintain which could adversely impact our net income 

systems failures elsewhere in the securities trading industry could also negatively impact us 

several highprofile systems failures occurred recently in the us securities trading industry renewing concerns among regulators and investors about the safety and resiliency of securities trading platforms it is possible that securities regulators could impose new requirements for securities trading platforms that would be costly for us to implement or that could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services in particular the secs proposed regulation systems compliance and integrity or regulation sci would subject portions of our securities trading platforms and other technological systems to more extensive regulation and oversight ensuring our compliance with the requirements of regulation sci for this portion of our platforms and systems could require significant implementation costs as well as increased ongoing administrative expenses and burdens if systems failures in the industry continue to occur it is also possible that investor confidence in the securities trading industry could diminish leading to decreased trading volume and revenue whether or not any of our own systems experience material failures any of these developments could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

damage to our reputation resulting from our administration of libor could adversely affect our business 

our subsidiary ice benchmark administration limited or ibal is the new administrator for libor ibals administration of libor is the result of the recent libor scandal which was a series of fraudulent actions taken by banks that were falsely inflating or deflating their rates so as to profit from trades or to give the impression that their trades were more creditworthy than they were any failures or negative publicity resulting from the transition of administration from the british bankers association to ibal or our administration following completion of the transition could result in a further loss of confidence in the administration of libor and could harm our reputation damage to our reputation could cause some market participants to reduce their trading volume on our exchanges or to cease using some or all of our other services any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

since we conduct operations in several different countries including the united states several european countries and canada substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling euros and canadian dollars because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

although we have entered into hedging transactions and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities accordingly if there are adverse movements in exchange rates we may suffer significant losses which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our investment in or acquisition of businesses outside of the united states and developing markets in particular could subject us to a variety of investment risks 

we have investments outside of the united states including in countries with developing markets for commodities trading in particular we own approximately 12 of the common stock of cetip we have a partnership in brix which is a brazilian marketplace for trading electric power and in february 2014 we completed the acquisition of the smx an exchange operator for commodity trading in asia the ability of companies we invest in or acquire to maintain or expand their businesses may be subject to many risks to which we are not otherwise subject including market risks related to sufficient demand to support the expansion of their business local legal and regulatory risks and political risks such as nationalization expropriation and outbreak of hostilities or war this is particularly true for any investments we make in companies operating in developing markets which may be subject to greater fluctuations in trading volumes and other revenue sources as the markets for their products are not sufficiently established there is no guarantee that our investments will be successful or that we will be able to sell our investments or acquisitions at prices and terms favorable to us further a decrease in value of the currencies where we have investments or acquired businesses would decrease the value of our investments or acquired businesses in these foreign jurisdictions and would have a negative impact on our financial statements 

loss of our exclusive licenses to list certain index options could adversely affect our business 

we hold exclusive licenses to list various index futures and contracts including russell’s index and dtcc gcf repo index ®  futures the owners of these indices may not renew the licenses with us on an exclusive basis or at all and the terms of some of these licenses including our licensing agreement with russell require that we achieve certain volume levels to maintain 

exclusivity additionally litigation or regulatory action like mifid ii may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and contracts trading to a single exchange and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license as previously discussed mifid ii introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of services relating to commodity derivatives across europe and the legislation requires open access to any benchmarks a benchmark is an index or other measure used to determine the value of a financial instrument for example libor or the sp 500 used in europe the final scope of the requirement is expected to be decided over the next year if unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive license were permitted we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products 

owning and operating voice broker businesses exposes us to additional risk and these businesses are largely dependent on their brokerdealer clients 

our voice broker business is primarily transactionbased and it provides brokerage services to clients primarily in the form of agency transactions although it also engages in a limited number of matched principal transactions in agency transactions customers pay transaction fees for trade execution services in which we connect buyers and sellers who settle their transactions directly in matched principal transactions also known as “riskless principal” transactions we agree to buy instruments from one customer and sell them to another customer the amount of the fee generally depends on the spread between the buy and sell price of the security that is brokered the majority of transactions by creditex and creditex brokerage which are the subsidiaries that engage in our voice broker business are agency transactions and the matched principal transactions accounted for approximately 9 of the total transactions for creditex and creditex brokerage for the year ended december 31 2013 with respect to matched principal transactions a counterparty to a matched principal transaction may fail to fulfill its obligations or creditex or creditex brokerage may face liability for an unmatched trade declines in trading volumes in credit derivatives would adversely affect the revenues we derive from creditex we also face the risk of not being able to collect transaction or processing fees charged to customers for brokerage services and processing services we provide 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties including trademarks service marks trade names trade secrets copyrights and patents we cannot assure you that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property additionally we may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property our failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively further we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights which may require significant financial and managerial resources as a result we may choose not to enforce our infringed intellectual property rights depending on our strategic evaluation and judgment regarding the best use of our resources the relative strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the recourse available to us 

in addition our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may have obtained and may be expected to obtain in the future patent rights related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services as a result we may face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the holders of the patents or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patents we also could be required to pay damages if we were found to infringe patents held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we rely on third party providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of an important service or supply by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as online service providers hosting service and software providers data processors software and hardware vendors banks local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading clearing and other systems we rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with 

third parties and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for the provision of hosting services the general trend toward industry consolidation may increase the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future if these companies were to discontinue providing services to us for any reason or fail to provide the type of service agreed to we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients or increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines 

many of our clients also rely on third parties such as online service providers software providers software and hardware vendors local and regional utility providers and telecommunications companies to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform if these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients’ inability to transact with our businesses 

we are subject to significant litigation and liability risks 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our participants involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred for example dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platform or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades abusive trading practices security and confidentiality breaches mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants in addition because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by entering them inaccurately a large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets in addition we are subject to various legal disputes some of which we are involved in due to acquisition activity we could incur significant expenses defending claims even those without merit which could adversely affect our financing condition and operating results an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

given our prominence in the global securities industry and the location of many of our properties and personnel in us and european financial centers including lower manhattan we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees in addition terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets including trading on exchanges any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness 

following our acquisition of nyse euronext we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis as of december 31 2013 we had 51 billion of outstanding debt this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities we have publicly announced our intention to reduce our indebtedness on a consolidated basis in the near term as we use our available resources to reduce and refinance our consolidated debt our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue future business opportunities may be further restrained in addition the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants including leverage and interest coverage ratios as well as limitations or required notices or approvals for acquisitions dispositions of assets and certain investment in subsidiaries the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other matters 

our longterm debt is currently rated by moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s these ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including our financial strength and 

conditions affecting the financial services industry generally our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time and it is possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade us in the future in particular our inability to effectively reduce our debt on a consolidated basis and within the time period communicated to our ratings agencies and the markets generally may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings and our ability to reduce our debt as expected may be impaired if we are unable to recognize part or all of the anticipated expense synergies from our acquisition of nyse euronext including the successful completion of euronext’s initial public offering in a timely manner in addition a significant decrease in our credit rating could impact the regulatory status of our clearing houses and make parties less willing to do business with our clearing houses and our exchanges that clear products through our clearing houses any downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets increase the cost of any future debt funding we may obtain and violate certain undertakings and commitments with the euronext college of regulators 

an “extraterritorial” change of law may adversely affect our business and under certain special arrangements our rights to control a substantial portion of our assets 

we own both us and european exchanges and trading platforms although we do not anticipate that there will be a material adverse application of european laws to our us exchanges and platforms or a material adverse application of us laws to our european exchanges and platforms the possibility of such an occurrence cannot be ruled out entirely if this were to occur and we were not able to effectively mitigate the effects of such “extraterritorial” application our affected exchanges and platforms could experience a reduction in trading or in the number of listed companies or business from other market participants or our business could otherwise be adversely affected 

in addition certain special arrangements consisting of two standby structures one involving a dutch foundation and one involving a delaware trust exist in relation to our us equity exchanges and our european equity exchanges the dutch foundation is empowered to take actions to mitigate the adverse effects of any potential changes in us law that have certain extraterritorial effects on our european regulated markets and the delaware trust is empowered to take actions to ameliorate the adverse effects of any potential changes in european law that have certain extraterritorial material effects on our us equity exchanges these actions include the exercise by the foundation or the trust of potentially significant control over the applicable european regulated markets or the us exchanges as the case may be although the dutch foundation and the delaware trust are required to act in our best interests subject to certain exceptions and any remedies may be implemented only for so long as the effects of the material adverse application of law persist we may as a result of the exercise of such rights be required to transfer control over a substantial portion of the euronext business or the applicable us exchanges to the direction of the trust or the foundation any such transfer of control could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy including our strategy for the euronext business and our ability to operate on an integrated and global basis which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt is dividends from our subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt further we have guaranteed the payment of certain obligations by our subsidiaries intercontinentalexchange inc and nyse euronext holdings llc these guarantees may require us to provide substantial funds or assets to creditors of our subsidiaries at a time when we are in need of liquidity to fund our own obligations and may affect our ability to make dividend payments to our stockholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt 

provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ice group 

our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of or unsolicited acquisition proposals for ice group these provisions make a change of control less likely which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of us and european equity exchanges for example our organizational documents include provisions that generally restrict any person either alone or together with its related persons from i voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10 of our outstanding voting capital stock including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock or ii beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock further our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to call special stockholders’ meetings or act by written consent and generally authorize our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock in 

addition provisions of delaware law may have a similar effect such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders as defined under delaware law from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the board of directors

consolidated financial highlights 

the following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented dollars in millions except per share amounts 



 factors affecting our results 

the business environments in which we operate directly affects our results of operations our results have been and will continue to be affected by many factors including the level of trading activity in our markets which during any period is significantly influenced by general market conditions competition price volatility market share and the pace of industry consolidation broad trends in the brokerage and finance industry price levels and price volatility the number and financial health of companies listed on nyse euronext’s cash markets geopolitical events weather and disasters real and perceived supply and demand imbalances availability of capital changing technology in the financial services industry and legislative and regulatory changes among other factors in particular in recent years the business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings the globalization of exchanges customers and competitors market participants’ demand for speed capacity and reliability which requires continuing investment in technology and increasing competition for market data revenues price volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates the need for the exchange of risk between market participants market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market’s strength the maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing 

the implementation of new regulations may impact participation in our markets generally legislative and regulatory bodies in the united states and europe have expressed increased concern regarding derivatives markets when underlying commodity prices rise as a result legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants which could affect trading volumes in particular many of the proposed changes are still being implemented and final regulations have not yet been adopted or significant uncertainties and ambiguities remain around adopted regulations in addition many market participants are still determining how they will respond to these regulations as a result it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us we do however expect it to affect our business in various and potentially significant ways and possibly result in increased costs and the expenditure of significant resources 

uncertainty in the us credit markets that commenced with the upheaval in 2008 continues to impact the economy equity market indices have experienced volatility and the market has remained volatile throughout 2013 economic uncertainty in the european union may also continue to negatively affect global financial markets in addition regulatory uncertainty is affecting our clients’ activities business models and technology spending while markets may improve these factors have adversely affected our revenues and operating income and may negatively impact future growth we expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our businesses any potential growth in the global cash markets will likely be tempered by investor uncertainty resulting from volatility in the cost of energy and commodities unemployment concerns and contagion concerns in relation to the sovereign debt issues faced by some members of the eurozone uncertainty as to near term tax regulatory and other government policies as well as the general state of the world economy we continue to focus on our strategy to broaden and diversify our revenue streams as well as on our companywide expense reduction initiatives in connection with our acquisition of nyse euronext in order to mitigate these uncertainties 

we also periodically make adjustments to our contract specifications changes to contracts are generally aimed at making the contracts more relevant to more customers and their evolving hedging needs or are required based on changes to the underlying commodity and may result in fluctuations in trading volume these and other factors could cause our revenues to fluctuate from period to period and these fluctuations may affect the reliability of period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results 

consolidated revenues 

the following table presents our consolidated revenues dollars in millions 



transaction and clearing fees net 

our transaction and clearing fees consist of fees collected from our derivatives trading and clearing and subsequent to our acquisition of nyse euronext on november 13 2013 from our cash trading in our derivatives markets we earn transaction and clearing fees from both counterparties to each contract that is traded andor cleared revenues for percontract fees are driven by the number of trades executed and fees charged per contract the amount of our percontract transaction and clearing fees will depend upon many factors including but not limited to transaction and clearing volume pricing and new product introductions the level of trading and clearing activity for all products is also influenced by market conditions and other factors see “ factors affecting our results” above 

following our acquisition of nyse euronext we also recognize transaction and clearing fee revenues from executing trades of derivatives contracts and clearing charges on nyse liffe in london and nyse liffe us and executing options contracts traded on nyse arca and nyse amex options the principal types of derivative contracts traded and cleared in these markets are interest rate products and equity and index products trading in shortterm interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility resulting from uncertainty over the direction of shortterm interest rates and trading in equity products is primarily driven by price volatility in equity markets and indices 

in addition we now recognize transaction and clearing fee revenues from cash trading cash trading consists of transaction charges for executing trades in our cash markets as well as transaction charges related to orders in our us cash markets which are routed to other market centers for execution additionally our us cash markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act of 1934 these fees are designed to recover the costs to the government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals activity assessment fees are collected from member organizations executing trades on our us 

cash markets and are recognized when these amounts are invoiced fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and as required by law the amount due to the sec is remitted semiannually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid the activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the section 31 fees as a result activity assessment fees and section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income 

as a result of completed and pending regulatory changes in the united states that offer greater regulatory and operational certainty to futures market participants relative to the swaps market on october 15 2012 we transitioned all of our cleared otc energy swaps contracts to futures contracts as a result our previously cleared north american natural gas north american power and global oil and other contracts have been transitioned to futures and the prior periods presentation of revenues and volumes have been reclassified to conform to this presentation 

north american natural gas futures and options volumes decreased 18 for the year ended december 31 2013 from the comparable period in 2012 and increased 12 for the year ended december 31 2012 from the comparable period in 2011 the decrease in volumes during the year ended december 31 2013 is primarily due to continued low volatility and low price levels for natural gas which produced muted trading activity in comparison to the record volume levels established during the year ended december 31 2012 the higher level of price volatility in 2012 was due in part to changes in expectations for natural gas inventories as the winter heating season progressed and changes in expectations for supply based on shale gas discoveries the record volume during the year ended december 31 2012 was also due to the introduction of new products increased natural gas options volume and increased demand for hedging and risk management as market participants became less risk averse as the global financial markets stabilized north american natural gas futures and options revenues decreased 3 for the year ended december 31 2012 from the comparable period in 2011 despite the 12 increase in volumes during this same period of time primarily due to increases in rebates relating to certain of these contracts during the year ended december 31 2012 

our benchmark ice brent crude futures contract is relied upon by a broad range of market participants including large oil producing nations and multinational companies to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption market participants are increasingly relying on the brent north sea contract for their risk management activities as evidenced by steady increases in traded volumes and open interest over the past several years brent crude volume also increased due to growth in ice brent crude options volume based on traded volume in both our ice brent crude futures contract and our ice wti crude futures contract we achieved a 55 56 and 51 market share of the global oil futures contracts trading for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively other oil futures and options contracts include our global oil and refined products wti crude oil us heating oil rbob gasoline and middle east sour crude the increase during the year ended december 31 2013 is primarily due to the successful launch of new global oil and refined product contracts as demand for oil contracts rose 

  effective january 1 2012 we implemented a trading and clearing fee increase on our agricultural commodity futures and options contracts at ice futures us as a result of increased regulatory staffing and regulatory burdens the expansion of products developed and listed by the exchange and significant enhancements in trading and clearing technology completed over the past five years the rate per contract for ice futures us agricultural commodity futures and options increased 11 to 259 per contract for the year ended december 31 2012 from 233 per contract for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase in the sugar futures and options contract revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 is primarily due to this fee increase 

our north american power futures and options volumes increased 45 for the year ended december 31 2013 from the comparable period in 2012 while corresponding revenues decreased 11 north american power futures and options volumes increased 53 for the year ended december 31 2012 from the comparable period in 2011 while revenues decreased 6 the north american power and futures options revenues decreased each of the last two years despite the volume increases year over year primarily due to growth in smaller sized power contracts which have a lower rate per contract than the full sized north american power contracts of the 138 million north american power futures and options contracts traded during the year ended december 31 2013 134 million contracts or 97 represented smaller sized power contracts which have a lower rate per contract than full sized north american power contracts compared to 94 and 88 of the volume representing smaller sized contracts during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively volume in the larger north american power contracts decreased the last two years primarily due to lower volatility on absolute price levels along with muted economic activity levels which resulted in lower power production and consumption during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 in addition uncertainty related to financial reform specifically rules relating to swaps markets impacted both north american natural gas and power contract volumes during the year ended december 31 2013 

our ice emissions futures and options revenues decreased 19 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 while volumes decreased 6 our ice emissions futures and options revenues increased 5 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 while corresponding volumes increased 23 the volume changes were greater than the revenue changes for each of the past two years primarily due to an increase in fee rebates each year and for the year ended december 31 2012 a decrease in average exchange rate of the euro to the us dollar compared to the year ended december 31 2011 the ice emissions futures and options contracts are billed in euros and the average exchange rate of the euro to

the increase in other futures and options revenues for the last two years is primarily due to increased trading volumes in our uk power dutch natural gas natural gas liquids cotton coffee and cocoa contracts and 13 million in revenues from nyse euronext other futures and options revenues for the period from november 13 2013 to december 31 2013 primarily relating to certain european derivatives contracts

the following tables present our consolidated nonoperating income expenses dollars in millions 



the increases in consolidated interest expense over the last two years are primarily due to an increase in the overall amount of debt outstanding during each of the periods see “ debt” below 

we acquired 316 million  shares or 12  of the common stock of cetip for an aggregate consideration of  514 million  in cash in july 2011  we account for our investment in cetip as an availableforsale investment and it is classified as a longterm investment in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013  the fair value of the equity security investment was 324 million  our investment in cetip was made in and the shares are valued in brazilian reais changes in the fair value of availableforsale securities that are considered to be temporary are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and include the effects of both stock price and foreign currency translation fluctuations the unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income until realized realized gains and losses and declines in value deemed to be otherthantemporary are recognized in earnings the accumulated losses of 190 million  as of december 31 2013  including losses of  67 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  resulted from  162 million  in foreign currency translation losses relating to the decrease in value of the brazilian real relative to the us dollar from the investment date in july 2011  through december 31 2013  and by a  28 million  decrease in the stock price of cetip through december 31 2013  

the impairment of cetip of 190 million was recorded as other expense and was driven primarily by the significant continued devaluation of the brazilian real since the investment was made and the expectation that the currency is not going to appreciate in the foreseeable future nor will the forecasted share price of cetip increase be sufficient to recover the unrealized loss the impairment will not be deductible for income tax purposes refer to note 5 to our consolidation financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for more information on this impairment

for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100 and for which we have control over the assets liabilities and management of the entity the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as noncontrolling interests as of december 31 2012 noncontrolling interest related to the operating results of our cds clearing subsidiaries in which nonice limited partners held a 455 net profit sharing interest during the year ended december 31 2013 we purchased 3 of the net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries from various nonice limited partners and the remaining nonice limited partners hold a 425 net 

profit sharing interest as of december 31 2013 in connection with our acquisition of nyse euronext we now a have noncontrolling interest related to various minority ownership interests held in our majority owned subsidiary nyse amex options in connection with our 79 acquisition of the derivatives and spot gas business of the former apxendex on march 26 2013 gasunie’s 21 ownership is included in the noncontrolling interest line subsequent to the acquisition date the increase in the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31 2013 from the comparable periods in 2012 is primarily related to these new noncontrolling interests and the increase in the cds clearing revenues during the year ended december 31 2013 the decrease in the net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the year ended december 31 2012 from the comparable period in 2011 is primarily related to the decrease in the cds revenues during this same period see “ consolidated revenues  transaction and clearing fees” above 

income tax provision 

consolidated income tax expense was 230 million 228 million and 238 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the change in our pretax income and the change in our effective tax rate each year our effective tax rate was 46 29 and 31 for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 is higher than the statutory federal rate primarily due to the nontax deductible impairment loss on the cetip investment along with state income taxes a foreign tax law change and other items other items are primarily driven by nontax deductible transaction costs relating to the nyse euronext acquisition and the effect of tax rate changes on our deferred tax balances these unfavorable adjustments were partially offset by the favorable foreign tax rate differential the effective tax rates for the years ended december 2012 and 2011 are lower than the statutory federal rate primarily due to the favorable foreign tax rate differential partially offset by state income taxes

liquidity and capital resources 

since our inception we have financed our operations growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures working capital strategic acquisitions and investments stock repurchases and the continued development of our electronic trading and clearing platforms we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt as it matures in the future we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities see “ debt” and “ future capital requirements” below we also expect to use the net proceeds of the planned ipo of euronext and the planned nyse technology divestiture to pay down certain of our outstanding debt see “ recent developments” above 

on november 13 2013 we acquired nyse euronext in a stock and cash transaction we paid cash consideration of 27 billion and issued an aggregate number of shares of common stock of 424 million shares to nyse euronext stockholders the cash consideration was funded from cash on hand 14 billion of net proceeds received in october 2013 in connection with ice groups public offering and sale of senior notes and 400 million of borrowings under our revolving facility as defined below we refinanced the new borrowings under our revolving facility and the 450 million borrowed under the 364 day facility as defined below through the issuance of a commercial paper program see “ debt” below 

upon maturity of old issuances and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper in order to mitigate the rollover risk we maintain undrawn backstop bank facilities for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper program in case we would not be able to issue new commercial paper we could draw on these backstop facilities which would result in higher interest expense 

consolidated cash and cash equivalents were 961 million and 16 billion as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively we had 437 million and 391 million in shortterm and longterm investments as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively and 438 million and 250 million in shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively we consider all shortterm highly liquid investments with remaining maturity dates of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents we classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as shortterm investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as longterm investments cash and investments that are not available for general use either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements are classified as restricted cash and investments 

as of december 31 2013 the amount of unrestricted cash held by our nonus subsidiaries was 576 million while we consider our nonus earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas if these cash balances are needed for our operations in the united states any repatriation by way of dividend may be subject to both us federal and state income taxes as adjusted for any nonus tax credits however we do not have any current needs or foreseeable plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our nonus subsidiaries 

our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of nonspeculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash such as overnight deposits term deposits money market funds mutual funds for treasury investments short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets we may invest a portion of our cash in excess of shortterm operating needs in investmentgrade marketable debt securities including government or government sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities 

certain of these investments with an original maturity of greater than three months will be classified as availableforsale in accordance with relevant accounting standards availableforsale investments are carried at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses net of deferred income taxes reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income realized gains and losses and declines in value deemed to be otherthantemporary on availableforsale investments are recognized currently in earnings we do not have any investments classified as heldtomaturity or trading

variation margin currencies if a clearing member were to fail to make payment in that currency while using original margin from the defaulting clearing member as security 

future capital requirements 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate of our trading and clearing volume growth strategic plans and acquisitions required technology and clearing initiatives regulatory requirements the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products the geographic mix of our business and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic platform we currently expect to make aggregate operational capital expenditures and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between 180 million and 200 million for the year ended december 31 2014 which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology and the continued expansion of our businesses in addition we currently expect 50 million to 60 million in capital expenditures during 2014 on real estate expenditures primarily associated with our new headquarters in atlanta and our headquarters in new york 

following the acquisition of nyse euronext our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board or audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio during the fourth quarter of 2013 we paid a quarterly dividend of 065 per share of our common stock for an aggregate payout of 75 million

when emir becomes effective later in 2014 the bank of england restricted cash capital requirements for ice clear europe will be superseded by the emir capital requirements which would require an estimated increase in the liquid regulatory capital requirements ranging from 140 million to 150 million this increase will be satisfied by way of additional restricted cash through our cash on hand in connection with ice clear us’s recognition as a third party qccp we contributed 50 million to ice clear us’s guaranty fund as of january 1 2014 through our cash on hand see “ recent development and trends  restricted cash and investments above 

nonus gaap financial measures 

we use nonus gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions when viewed in conjunction with our us gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than us gaap measures alone in addition we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for periodtoperiod comparison of results because the items described below are not reflective of our core business performance these financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to us gaap financial measures and may be different from nonus gaap measures used by other companies we use adjusted net income attributable to ice group and adjusted earnings per share attributable to ice group common shareholders because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on us gaap financial measures since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our operating performance we strongly recommend that investors 

review the us gaap financial measures included in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 

adjusted net income attributable to ice group for the periods presented below is calculated by adding net income attributable to ice group the adjustments described below which are not reflective of our core business performance and their related income tax effect the following table reconciles net income attributable to ice group to adjusted net income attributable to ice group and calculates adjusted earnings per share attributable to ice group common shareholders for the periods presented below in millions except per share amounts   



we include acquisitionrelated transaction costs as part of our core business expenses except for those that are directly related to the announcement closing financing or termination of a transaction however we are including all of the acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs relating to our acquisition of nyse euronext as nonus gaap adjustments given the size of the acquisition during the year and three months ended december 31 2013 in addition to the nyse euronext acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs we also include as adjustments the impairment loss recorded on our equity investment in cetip the banker success fee relating to the acquisition of ice endex the expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt the impact of certain foreign tax law changes that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013 and the duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs we incurred as we consolidated multiple new york office locations in the current year during the year and three months ended december 31 2012 we recognized as an adjustment transactionrelated costs relating to our acquisition of nyse euronext during the year andor three months ended december 31 2011 we recognized as adjustments a banker fee related to our investment in cetip and certain interest expenses related to our credit facilities for additional information on these items refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

as of december 31 2013 in connection with our acquisition of nyse euronext we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs the date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs 

the external investors in our nyse amex options market have received an equity instrument and have the option to require us to repurchase a portion of the instruments on an annual basis through 2015 the amount we are required to purchase under this arrangement is capped each year at between 5 and 15 of the total outstanding shares of nyse amex options in addition the external investor in ice endex has a put option to sell its remaining stake to us two years from the date of closing of the acquisition and it expires five years from the date of closing we recognized the full redemption values ie fair values of 322 million relating to these two instruments as mezzanine equity and classified the related balances as part of redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013 however we cannot estimate whether and if they do when the external investors will elect to exercise their remaining put options see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on the redeemable noncontrolling interest 

new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us 

critical accounting policies 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the accounting matters described below we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments based on these factors we make estimates and judgments about among other things the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies among others affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results assets and liabilities 

goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 

we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired including other identified intangible assets we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift our judgments may change which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances as of december 31 2013 we had goodwill of 95 billion and net other intangible assets of 94 billion relating to our acquisitions our purchase of trademarks and internet domain names from various third parties and the russell licensing agreement of these amounts 75 billion in goodwill and 86 billion of other intangible assets relates to our acquisition of nyse euronext on november 13 2013 we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over the lesser of their contractual or estimated useful lives 

in performing the purchase price allocation we consider among other factors the intended future use of acquired assets analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business at the acquisition date a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation we continue to review and validate estimates assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period accordingly these estimates and assumptions are subject to change which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition 

our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill reporting unit or other indefinitelived intangibles to its estimated fair value we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination subsequent to our acquisition of nyse euronext we have identified five reporting units our futures reporting unit our cds reporting unit our cash listings reporting unit our euronext reporting unit and our technology reporting unit the cash listings euronext and technology reporting units were added as part of our nyse euronext acquisition on november 13 2013 

goodwill impairment testing consists of a twostep methodology the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value including goodwill and other intangible assets of such reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no impairment loss is recognized and the second step which is a calculation of the impairment is not performed however if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recorded equal to 

the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value for annual goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill and other intangible assets if we conclude that this is the case we must perform the twostep methodology described above otherwise we can skip the twostep methodology and do not need to perform any further testing for annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount 

application of the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows longterm growth rates of our business operating margins discount rates weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets these estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment and changes to these estimates and assumptions as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor impairment the cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and when applicable various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets impairment may result from among other things deterioration in the performance of our business adverse market conditions adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations competition or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets through december 31 2013 in the past since the fair value of our futures and market data reporting units have significantly exceeded their carrying values we have exercised our option to perform qualitative assessments to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units were less than their carrying amount including goodwill and other intangible assets however as we combined our futures and market data reporting units into one combined futures reporting unit during the year ended december 31 2013 we proceeded directly to the preparation of a discounted cash flow valuation to estimate the fair value of our futures reporting unit the discounted cash flow valuation indicated a fair value of our futures reporting unit significantly exceeding its carrying value we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill in our futures reporting units in the foreseeable future given the acquisition of nyse euronext on november 13 2013 we determined impairment analysis was not needed for our cash listings euronext and technology reporting units during the fourth quarter 2013 goodwill analysis testing 

among our reporting units the fair value of our cds reporting unit has been the closest to its carrying value in prior goodwill impairment analyses our cds reporting unit includes the financial results and net assets of creditex ice clear credit and the cds clearing business at ice clear europe cds trade execution revenues at creditex have decreased the last several years the cds execution business remains pressured due to financial reform implementation and a general lack of volatility in the corporate credit markets however the decline in cds trading revenues was offset by an increase in ice cds clearing the listing of additional cleared cds products and signing on new clearing members along with a decrease in expenses at creditex also with the advent of mandatory clearing during 2013 cds clearing activity by investment funds asset managers and similar buy side market participants has increased significantly 

during the first step of the cds impairment review in the fourth quarter of 2013 we performed a discounted cash flow valuation to estimate the fair value of our cds reporting unit the valuation of our cds reporting unit concluded that the fair value exceeded carrying value by 164 million or 24 of the carrying value in the fourth quarter of 2013 as of december 31 2013 the cds goodwill and other intangible assets balances were 494 million the discount rate used in the cds discounted cash flow valuation is intended to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the cds reporting unit and was 124 in the fourth quarter 2013 review a 10 basis point increase in the discount rate used would not have a material impact on our fair value of the cds reporting unit a 10 decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the cds reporting unit would result in the fair value of the reporting unit exceeding the carrying value by 79 million 

given the current market conditions and continued economic and regulatory uncertainty the fair value of our cds reporting unit may deteriorate and could result in the need to record an impairment charge in future periods we continue to monitor potential triggering events in our cds reporting unit including changes in the business and regulatory climate in which it operates the current volatility in the capital markets our recent operating performance and our financial projections any changes in these factors could result in an impairment charge 

we are also required to evaluate other finitelived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable if impairment indicators are present then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these longlived assets is 

compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable if an asset is not recoverable the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis our evaluation has not resulted in any impairment of other finitelived intangible assets and property and equipment through december 31 2013 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse 

we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position if the recognition threshold is met we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that in our judgment is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 

the undistributed earnings from our nonus subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no provision for us federal and state income taxes has been made in our consolidated financial statements a distribution of these nonus earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise could subject us to both us federal and state income taxes as adjusted for nonus tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various nonus countries determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable 

we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter at any point in time many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities changes in facts and circumstances issuance of new regulations and resolution of tax audits 

we believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

revenue recognition  listing fees 

in connection with our acquisition of nyse euronext there are two types of fees applicable to companies listed on the nyse nyse arca nyse mkt and euronext  listing fees and annual fees listing fees consist of two components original listing fees and fees related to other corporate action original listing fees subject to a minimum and maximum amount are based on the number of shares that the company initially lists original listing fees however are generally not applicable to companies that transfer to one of our us securities exchanges from another market except for companies transferring to nyse mkt from the overthecounter market other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares annual fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year original listing fees are recognized on a straightline basis over their estimated service periods of nine years for nyse and euronext and five years for nyse arca and nyse mkt other corporate listing fees are recognized on a straightline basis over their estimated service periods of six years for nyse and euronext and three years for nyse arca and nyse mkt unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet 

we have determined that at the time of our acquisition of nyse euronext we did not have a legal performance obligation relating to these listing fees therefore in connection with purchase accounting and in accordance with us gaap we wrote off and assigned a fair value of zero to the nyse euronext unamortized deferred revenue balances relating to the listing fees as of the acquisition date of november 13 2013 the historical nyse euronext listing fees deferred revenue balance as of that date was 486 

million the unamortized deferred revenue balances as of december 31 2013 of 7 million relates to listing fees incurred and billed and not yet recognized as revenue subsequent to the november 13 2013 acquisition through december 31 2013 

pension and other postretirement employee benefits 

in connection with our acquisition of nyse euronext we assumed nyse euronext’s pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans covering its us and certain european operations pension and other postretirement employee benefits costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts these assumptions include discount rates to measure future obligation and interest expense health care cost trend rates benefits earned interest cost expected return on assets mortality rates and other factors in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 




 item 7 a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as a result of our operating and financing activities we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk foreign currency exchange risk and credit risk we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure manage monitor and report risk exposures which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies 

interest rate risk 

we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2013 and 2012 our cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments were 18 billion and 23 billion respectively of which 819 million and 519 million respectively were denominated in brazilian reais pounds sterling euros or canadian dollars changes in the cetip investment which is recorded as an availableforsale longterm investment and was recorded in and is held in brazilian reais was valued at 324 million as of december 31 2013 see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  consolidated nonoperating income expenses” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for discussion of the cetip investment the remaining investments are denominated in us dollars we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes a hypothetical decrease in longterm interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pretax earnings by 4 million as of december 31 2013 assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments and shortterm and longterm restricted cash and investments 

as of december 31 2013 we had 51 billion in outstanding indebtedness of which 14 billion relates to the senior notes and 22 billion relates to the nyse euronext notes both of which bear interest at fixed interest rates of the remaining amount outstanding 11 billion relates to the commercial paper program and 378 million relates to the term loan facility both of which bear interest at fluctuating rates and therefore subjects us to interest rate risk a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in longterm interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program and term loan facility would decrease annual pretax earnings by 15 million assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity the interest rates on our commercial paper program and term loan facility are currently reset on a daily monthly or quarterly basis see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  debt” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as an international group we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses are recorded in euros or pounds sterling certain assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries 

our exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the year ended december 31 2013 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table in millions except average rates 

 nyse euronext which we acquired on november 13 2013 has a significant part of its assets liabilities revenues and expenses recorded in euros or pounds sterling for the month of december 2013 which included the results of nyse euronext for the entire month 32 of our consolidated revenues less transactionbased expenses were denominated in euros or pounds sterling and 29 of our consolidated expenses were denominated in euros or pounds sterling as the euro or pound sterling exchange rate changes the us equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly 

we have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables that occur through our operations which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods we had foreign currency transaction losses of 2 million and 4 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar a 10 adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2013 would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of 16 million assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity 

we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 as economic hedges to hedge a portion of our foreign currency transaction exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure 

we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using a current rate of exchange with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account a component of equity our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below in millions 



to hedge against these exposures at december 31 2013 we had €157 million 216 million of eurous dollar £192 million €229 million of pound sterlingeuro dollar and £15 million 25 million of pound sterlingus dollar foreign exchange hedging contracts outstanding these contracts mature between january and february 2014 and had a fair value of 4 million asset at december 31 2013 additionally nyse euronexts borrowing in euro of €09 billion 13 billion constitutes a partial hedge of 

nyse euronexts net euro investment in foreign entities the pre tax loss of 31 million for the year ended december 31 2013 was recorded as a component of other comprehensive income as a result of this partial net investment hedge 

as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive income from foreign currency translation was 377 million and 73 million respectively based on december 31 2013 net currency positions a hypothetical 10 decrease of euro against us dollar would negatively impact our equity by 280 million and a hypothetical 10 decrease of pound sterling against us dollar would negatively impact our equity by 420 million for the year ended december 31 2013 currency exchange rate differences had a positive impact of 304 million on our consolidated equity 

credit risk 

we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments wellcapitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties 

an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties our policies require diversification of counterparties banks financial institutions bond issuers and funds so as to avoid a concentration of risk 

clearing house cash deposits credit risk 

our clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are invested to generate interest income for our clearing members refer to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for more information on the clearing houses cash deposits which were 422 billion as of december 31 2013 following is a summary of the risks associated with this investment activity and how these risks are mitigated 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of the purchased security to decline if we were required to sell the security prior to its maturity and interest rates had risen the sale of the security might be made at a loss relative to its original purchase price our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making all of our cash deposit investments in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within 1 to 37 days our clearing house investment guidelines require that a minimum of 50 of clearing member cash deposits are invested in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within 1 business day efforts are made to invest the remaining 50 in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within 37 business days if this is not possible our policy allows for the investment of up to 50 of clearing member cash deposits in high quality sovereign debt for example us treasury securities and supranational debt instruments euro cash deposits only with the shortest possible time to maturity provided that no such direct investment in a sovereign debt or supranational instrument will have a time to maturity greater than 397 days 109 years 

security issuer risk 

security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures this risk is mitigated by investing clearing member cash deposits in high quality sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements or direct investments in high quality sovereign and supranational debt issues thus the risk is mitigated because in the event of a security issuer default we are left with a highly marketable liquid security 

investment counterparty risk 

investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty or an investment adviser might become insolvent and thus fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and investment advisors 

when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts that are under the control of our clearing house additionally the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2 of the reverse repurchase amount thus in the event that a reverse repurchase counterpart defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty’s obligation to our clearing house 

our clearing houses do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments with any of our investment advisors our clearing house property is held in custody accounts controlled by our clearing houses our clearing houses property is held with credit worthy custodians which include jpmorgan chase bank na citibank na bny mellon bmo harris na and euroclear bank brussels for nonus dollar deposits 

each clearing house employs or will employ multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event that a single investment adviser or custodian becomes unable to fulfill its role additional investment advisors or custodians are available as backups    

crosscurrency margin deposit risk 

each of our clearing houses pursuant to their rules may permit posting of crosscurrency collateral to satisfy margin requirements for example accepting original margin deposits denominated in us dollars to secure a japanese yen variation margin obligation the risk exists that the value of the original margin currency provided to satisfy margin obligations declines in value resulting in an inability to make required variation margins in the appropriate currency this risk is mitigated by applying a “haircut” to the original margin currency at a level sufficiently high enough to weather periods of high currency volatility crosscurrency balances are markedtomarket on a daily basis should the value of the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value the clearing member is required to increase its original margin deposit on a sameday basis 

impact of inflation 

we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or to decline in the event of inflation we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants as the prices that we charge are not governed by longterm contracts
