risks related to our business brand industry and operations

we face risks regarding our ability to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future

we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues and earnings are affected by changes in competitors’ prices and general economic issues we compete with other large pest control companies as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are quality of service customer proximity terms of guarantees reputation for safety technical proficiency and price although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service are excellent we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain our competitive position in the future and any competitive pressures we may face could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not be able to identify complete or successfully integrate acquisitions or guarantee that any acquisitions will achieve the anticipated financial benefits all of which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations

acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy we cannot assure investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future or that any acquisitions will achieve the anticipated financial benefits our inability to achieve the anticipated financial benefits from any acquisition transactions may not be realized due to any number of factors including but not limited to unsuccessful integration efforts unexpected or underestimated liabilities or increased costs fees expenses and charges related to such transactions such adverse events could result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets established as a result of such transactions triggering an impairment these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

expanding into international markets presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations may not be successful 

an element of our strategy includes further expansion into international markets our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by political economic and social conditions beyond our control local laws and customs and legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with applicable anticorruption and currency laws and regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our financial results

our business depends on our strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands and develop a positive client reputation could hurt our ability to retain and expand our base of customers 

​ 

our strong brands rollins orkin hometeam clark pest control western northwest exterminating trutech critter control ifc waltham and others have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing our brands increases our ability to enter new markets and launch new and innovative services that better serve the needs of our customers our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including among others reputational issues and producttechnical failures further if our brands are significantly damaged our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we continue to develop strategies and innovative tools to gain a deeper understanding of customer acquisition and retention in order to more effectively expand and retain our customer base maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a service leader and continue to provide highquality pest control services that are truly beneficial and play a meaningful role in people’s lives

our franchisees subcontractors and vendors could take actions that could harm our business 

our franchisees subcontractors and vendors are contractually obligated to operate their businesses in accordance with the standards set forth in our agreements with them and applicable laws and regulations each of our brands that are franchised also provides training and support to franchisees however franchisees subcontractors and vendors are independent third parties that we do not control and who own operate and oversee the daily operations of their businesses and the ultimate success of any business operation rests with the business owner if franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required standards royalty payments owed to us will be adversely affected and our brands’ image and reputation could be harmed this could materially adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows similarly if franchisees subcontractors and vendors do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required laws standards and regulations we could be subject to claims from regulators or legal claims for the actions or omissions of such thirdparty franchisees subcontractors and vendors in addition our relationship with our franchisees subcontractors and vendors could become strained including resulting in litigation as we impose new standards or assert more rigorous enforcement practices of the existing required standards these strains in our relationships or any resulting claims could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows

from time to time we receive communications from our franchisees regarding complaints disputes or questions about our practices and standards in relation to our franchised operations and certain economic terms of our franchise arrangements if franchisees or groups representing franchisees were to bring legal proceedings against us our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected

labor shortages andor our ability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability 

our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers create leadership opportunities and successfully implement diversity equity and inclusion initiatives our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force the demand for employees is high and the supply is limited covid19 has exacerbated labor shortages and the enforcement of covid19 mandates may result in additional labor shortages which could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate at full capacity or lead to increased costs such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees a significant increase in the wages paid and benefits offered by competing employers could also result in a reduction in our labor force increases in our labor costs or both prolonged labor shortages increased turnover or labor inflation could diminish our profitability and impair our growth potential which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

climate change and unfavorable weather conditions could adversely impact our financial results 

our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions worldwide including catastrophic events natural disasters and potential impacts from climate change climate change continues to receive increasing global attention the possible effects of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing storm patterns and intensities changing temperature levels and changes in legislation regulation and international accords all of which could adversely impact our costs and business operations the business of our company is also affected by seasonality associated with our pest and termite control services the increase in pest presence and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of our pest and termite control operations during such periods the business of the company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate change and any 

​ 

resulting unfavorable weather conditions we cannot predict its potential impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

risks related to the global economy and public health crises

our business results of operations and financial condition are impacted by the coronavirus covid19 pandemic and the restrictions put in place in connection therewith 

we have responded and continue to respond to the global outbreak of covid19 by taking steps to mitigate the potential risks posed to us by its spread and the impact of the restrictions put in place by the local state and federal governments to protect the population we continue to execute our comprehensive set of protocols for the health and safety of our employees customers and business partners such as wearing masks gloves and other personal protective equipment social distancing and utilizing electronic documents among others however due to the unprecedented uncertainty surrounding the duration of covid19 covid19 variants rapidly changing governmental directives public health challenges and progress macroeconomic consequences and market reactions thereto we are not able at this time to predict the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and it continues to be challenging for our management to estimate the future performance of our business and develop strategies to generate growth or achieve our objectives for 2022 and beyond 

in september 2021 the federal government issued an executive order requiring united states based employees contractors and subcontractors that work on or in support of united states government contracts to be fully vaccinated by january 4 2022 and it only permits limited exceptions for medical and religious reasons the “covid19 executive order” on december 7 2021 the united states district court for the southern district of georgia issued a preliminary nationwide injunction enjoining the enforcement of the covid19 executive order the government appealed the order to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit and briefing is due to the eleventh circuit by april 4 2022 

as a result of the covid19 executive order we may be forced to terminate relationships with various united states government agencies we provide services to furthermore certain customers have issued vaccine requirements with respect to our technicians who provide onsite services at our commercial customer’s facilities the covid19 executive order along with any customerspecific mandates or rules could result in labor shortages as well as difficulty securing future labor needs which could impact our ability to provide services to our customers potentially resulting in material adverse impacts to our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows

adverse economic conditions including inflation and restrictions in customer discretionary expenditures disruptions in credit or financial markets increases in fuel prices raw material costs or other operating costs could materially adversely affect our business 

economic downturns may adversely affect our commercial customers including food service hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies for example we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers if consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures due to inflation or other economic hardships we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines disruptions in credit or financial markets could make it more difficult for us to obtain or increase the cost of obtaining financing in the future in addition there can be no assurances that fuel prices raw material costs or other operating costs all of which may be subject to inflationary pressures will not materially increase in future years and we cannot predict the extent to which any such future increases could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

​ 

risks related to cybersecurity privacy compliance and business disruptions 

the company its whollyowned subsidiaries thirdparty business partners and service providers have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and could be the targets of future attacks which could result in the disruption to the company’s business operations economic and reputational damage and possible fines penalties and private litigation if there is unauthorized access to or unintentional distribution of personal financial proprietary confidential or other protected data or information the company is entrusted to keep about its customers employees business practices or third parties

our privacy compliance and digital risk management initiatives focus on the threats and risks to enterprise information and the underlying it systems processing such information as part of the implementation of business processes the company also relies on among other things commercially available vendors cybersecurity protection systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of protected information and data the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk meet standards set by the payment card industry “pci” we have also implemented policies and procedures internal training system controls and monitoring and audit processes to protect the company from internal and external vulnerabilities and to comply with consumer privacy laws in the areas in which we operate further the company limits retention of certain data encrypts certain data and otherwise protects information to comply with consumer privacy laws in the areas in which we operate

risks related to legal regulatory and risk management matters 

we are from time to time subject to lawsuits investigations and other proceedings which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our operations may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with applicable law or other governmental regulations including environmental and other regulations relating to the pest control industry 

in the normal course of business we are involved in various claims contractual disputes investigations arbitrations and litigation including claims that our acts omissions services or vehicles caused damage or injury claims that our services did not achieve the desired results claims related to acquisitions allegations by federal state or local authorities including the sec of violations of regulations or statutes claims related to wage and hour law violations and claims related to environmental matters these claims proceedings or litigation either alone or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

​ 

the ongoing sec investigation and any potential related litigation entail risks and uncertainties

as we previously disclosed the sec is conducting an investigation the “sec investigation” we believe the sec investigation is primarily focused on how the company established accruals and reserves at periodends for periods beginning january 1 2016 through december 31 2018 and the impact of those accruals and reserves on reported earnings per share specifically in the first quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2017 the company is in ongoing discussions with the sec staff regarding a potential resolution of the sec investigation in light of the foregoing in accordance with the accounting guidance in asc 450 “contingencies” the company recorded an accrual for 80 million related to the sec investigation in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 which is reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial position the ultimate amount of any liability related to the potential resolution of the sec investigation could be different from the 80 million accrued as of december 31 2021 the company will continue to cooperate with the sec in working towards a final resolution of the sec investigation as we previously reported during the third quarter of 2021 the audit committee of the company’s board of directors initiated a related supplemental internal investigation this supplemental investigation was concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the company believes that no restatement of its prior period financial statements will be required as a result of the sec investigation or matters related thereto 

there can be no assurance that the sec or another regulatory body will not make further regulatory inquiries or pursue action against the company and its directors or senior officers that could result in potentially significant sanctions and penalties or that could require the company to take additional remedial steps which could include revising or restating portions of our historical net income and earnings per share for the impacted quarterly periods potential sanctions against the company andor individuals include penalties injunctions and ceaseanddesist orders in addition the company and its current or former senior officers and directors may be subject to litigation including by the company’s stockholders related to the matters under review by the sec accordingly the sec investigation and any potential related litigation in connection with the sec investigation entail risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could materially adversely affect our reputation results of operations financial position and liquidity and stock price 

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures

we are exposed to liabilities that are unique to our business and the services we provide we maintain commercial liability insurance that extends to products liability in addition we also maintain other insurance and other traditional risk transfer tools to respond to certain types of liabilities and risks however such tools are subject to terms such as deductibles retentions limits and policy exclusions as well as risk of denial of coverage default or insolvency if we suffer unexpected or uncovered losses or if any of our insurance policies are terminated for any reason or are not effective in mitigating our risks we may incur losses that are not covered or that exceed our coverage limits which could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition there can be no assurance that the types or levels of coverage maintained are adequate to cover these potential significant and catastrophic risks further we may not be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance coverage or obtain comparable or additional insurance coverage at a reasonable cost in the event a significant product or service claim arises 

our safety and risk management programs may not have the intended effect of reducing our liability for employeework related injuries third partyliability claims or property loss

our safety management system and performance measures are critical to our reputation many of our customers require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to provide service and bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures accordingly if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards we could experience reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

we attempt to mitigate risks relating to employee workrelated injuries thirdparty liability or property loss through the implementation of companywide safety management programs designed to focus on prevention and decrease the occurrence of accidents or events that may occur it is expected that any such decreases could also have the effect of stabilizing or reducing our insurance costs however incidents involving injury or property loss may be caused by multiple potential factors a significant number of which are beyond our control therefore there is no guarantee that our safety and risk management and safety programs will have the desired effect of avoiding or controlling all potential expenses and liability exposure

risks related to our capital and ownership structure

the company’s management has a substantial ownership interest public stockholders may have no effective voice in the company’s management

the company has elected the “controlled company” exemption under section 303a of the new york stock exchange “nyse” listed company manual the company is a “controlled company” because a group that includes the company’s chairman of the board and chief executive officer gary w rollins and certain companies under his control the “controlling group” controls in excess of fifty percent of the company’s voting power as a “controlled company” the company need not comply with certain nyse rules including without limitation the requirements that the company have a majority of independent directors and an independent compensation and nominating committee of the board

rollins inc’s executive officers directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership in the aggregate approximately 53 percent of the company’s outstanding shares of common stock as of december 31 2021 as a result these persons will effectively control the operations of the company including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company at a premium

our management has a substantial ownership interest and the availability of the company’s common stock to the investing public may be limited

the availability of rollins’ common stock to the investing public is limited to those shares not held by the executive officers directors and their affiliates which could negatively impact rollins’ stock trading prices and affect the ability of minority stockholders to sell their shares future sales by executive officers directors and their affiliates of all or a portion of their shares could also negatively affect the trading price of our common stock

the controlling group could take various actions or engage in certain transactions that could negatively impact our common stock price cause volatility in the market for our common stock or have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and our financial condition 

the controlling group may from time to time and at any time in their sole discretion acquire or cause to be acquired additional equity or other instruments of the company its subsidiaries or affiliates or derivative instruments the value of which is linked to company securities or dispose or cause to be disposed such equity or other securities or instruments in any amount that the controlling group may determine in their sole discretion through open market transactions privately negotiated transactions or otherwise in addition depending upon a variety of factors the controlling group may at any time engage in discussions with the company and its affiliates and other persons including retained outside advisers concerning the company’s business management strategic alternatives and direction and in their sole discretion consider formulate and implement various plans or proposals intended to enhance the value of their investment in the company including among other things proposing or effecting any matter that would constitute or result in i the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the company or the disposition of securities of the company in addition to the possible normal course dissolution of additional entities for estate or tax planning purposes ii an extraordinary corporate transaction such as a merger reorganization or liquidation involving the company or any subsidiary thereof iii a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the company or any subsidiary thereof iv a change in the present board of directors or management of the company including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board v a material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the company vi other material changes in the company’s business or corporate structure vii changes in the company’s charter bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the company by any person viii causing a class of securities of the company to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an interdealer quotation system of a registered national securities association or ix a class of equity securities of the company becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to section 12g4 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in the event the controlling group were to engage in any of the actions enumerated above our common stock price could be negatively impacted such actions could cause volatility in the market for our common stock or could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition

​ 

certain provisions in rollins inc’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover of the company

rollins inc’s certificate of incorporation bylaws and other documents contain provisions including advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and staggered terms for the board of directors these provisions may make a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors more difficult or expensive

as we previously disclosed the sec is conducting an investigation the “sec investigation” we believe the sec investigation is primarily focused on how the company established accruals and reserves at periodends for periods beginning january 1 2016 through december 31 2018 and the impact of those accruals and reserves on reported earnings per share specifically in the first quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2017 the company is in ongoing discussions with the sec staff regarding a potential resolution of the sec investigation in light of the foregoing in accordance with the accounting guidance in asc 450 “contingencies” the company recorded an accrual for 80 million related to the sec investigation in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 which is reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial position the ultimate amount of any liability related to the potential resolution of the sec investigation could be different from the 80 million accrued as of december 31 2021 the company will continue to cooperate with the sec in working towards a final resolution of the sec investigation as we previously reported during the third quarter of 2021 the audit committee of the company’s board of directors initiated a related supplemental internal investigation this supplemental investigation was concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021 the company believes that no restatement of its prior period financial statements will be required as a result of the sec investigation or matters related thereto see “item 1a risk factors risks related to legal regulatory and risk management matters  the ongoing sec investigation and any potential related litigation entail risks and uncertainties”

management does not believe that any pending claim proceeding or litigation regulatory action or investigation either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity however it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter or year

general operating comments

2021 marked the company’s 24th consecutive year of increased revenues revenues for the year rose 122 percent to 24 billion compared to 22 billion for the prior year income before income taxes increased 339 to 4748 million compared to 3547 million the prior year net income increased 345 to 3507 million with earnings per diluted share of 071 compared to 2608 million or 053 per diluted share for the prior year the company has continued to increase dividends to investors with 042 per diluted share paid in 2021 as compared to 033 per diluted share for the prior year resulting in a 27 increase in dividends per share in 2020 the dividend was reduced due to the uncertainty surrounding the effects of the covid19 pandemic “covid19” to our business

cybersecurity incident 

in october 2021 a thirdparty information technology managed service provider “msp” of the company was the target of a cybersecurity incident the “incident” resulting in the shutdown of the company’s thirdparty customer relationship management software used by certain of our subsidiaries whose aggregate annual revenues comprise less than 11 of our total revenues upon notice of the incident from the msp the company immediately initiated its incident response protocols there was no known material daytoday impact to our ability to provide normal service to customers and there was no known indication that the information of our customers or employees was compromised as a result of the incident the incident did not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition however we may continue to be the target of further cybersecurity incidents that could possibly have a material adverse effect on our business reputation results of operation or financial condition more information about our cybersecurity risks is discussed under item 1a “risk factors” of part i of this annual report on form 10k

covid19 

the global spread and unprecedented impact of the covid19 pandemic “covid19” continues to create significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption around the world in 2020 the pest control industry was designated as “essential” by the department of homeland security the company has been able to remain operational in every part of the world in which it operates with the availability of vaccinations many covid19 restrictions have been lifted however public hesitancy regarding the vaccinations and the continued spread of covid19 may result in additional restrictions and mandates being imposed the situation related to covid19 continues to be complex and dynamic we cannot reasonably estimate the duration of the pandemic or fully ascertain its impact to 

​ 

our future results we will continue to actively monitor the rapidly evolving situation related to covid19 and may take actions that may alter our operations including those that may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers and communities we do not know when or if it will become practical to relax or eliminate some or all of these measures entirely as there is no guarantee that covid19 will be fully contained

the company’s consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the company considered the impact of covid19 on the assumptions and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements in the opinion of management all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the company’s financial results for the year have been made these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature but complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the global economic impact of covid19 the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 are not necessarily indicative of results for future years the severity magnitude and duration as well as the economic consequences of covid19 are uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict therefore our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to covid19 and may change materially in future periods

​ 

results of operations—2021 versus 2020

 ​ 

revenues

revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 were 24 billion an increase of 2631 million or 122 from 2020 revenues of 22 billion comparing 2021 to 2020 residential pest control revenue increased 13 commercial pest control revenue increased 10 and termite and ancillary services grew 14 the company’s revenue mix for the year ended december 31 2021 consisted primarily of 46 residential pest control 34 commercial pest control and 20 termite and ancillary revenues such as moisture control insulation deck and gutter work the company’s foreign operations accounted for approximately 8 and 7 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively

cost of services provided

for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 cost of services provided increased 1140 million or 109 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2020 the increase was driven by increased people costs and materials and supplies due to the increase in revenues additionally fleet costs increased mainly driven by an increase in fuel costs

sales general and administrative

for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 sales general and administrative sga expenses increased 713 million or 109 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2020 the increases were driven by increased people costs mostly due to sales personnel directly related to our increase in revenues additionally sga increased due to the accrual related to the potential settlement of the ongoing sec matter of 80 million increased advertising costs and the charitable donation of certain excess personal protection equipment

depreciation and amortization

for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 depreciation and amortization increased 59 million or 67 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2020 the increase was due to the additional amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions

​ 

other income expense

during the twelve months ended december 31 2021 other income increased 440 million primarily due to the company recognizing a gain of 357 million compared to a loss of 16 million in the prior year the current year gain is primarily related to multiple saleleaseback transactions where the company sold and leased back properties that it acquired in 2019 with the clark pest control acquisition additionally 2020 included 67 million of accelerated stock compensation vesting expense that did not occur in 2021 

interest expense net

interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 was 08 million and 51 million respectively the decrease was primarily driven by the lower average debt balance in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020

income taxes

the company’s effective tax rate decreased to 261 in 2021 compared to 265 in 2020 the rate is lower in the current year due to a net increase in beneficial deductions driven by an increase in the portion of officer’s compensation deductions that were allowable

liquidity and capital resources

​ 

critical accounting estimates

the company views critical accounting estimates to be those that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management’s most difficult complex or subjective judgments the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we believe our critical accounting estimate to be as follows

accrued insurance— the company retains up to specified limits certain risks related to general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability risks are managed through either high deductible insurance or for clark pest control only a nonaffiliated group captive insurance member arrangement the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims the group captive is subject to a thirdparty actuary retained by the captive manager independent from the company for the high deductible insurance program the company contracts with an independent thirdparty actuary on a semiannual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve along with management’s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances management’s judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control additionally historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events the company continues to be proactive in safety and risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce and prevent incidents and claims initiatives that have been implemented include required preemployment screening and ongoing motor vehicle record review for all drivers postoffer physicals for new employees prehire random and post incident drug testing driver training and postinjury nurse triage for workrelated injuries the accruals and reserves we hold are based on estimates that involve a degree of judgment and are inherently variable and could be overestimated or insufficient if actual claims exceed our estimates our operating results could be materially affected and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to our securities you are cautioned that the risk factors discussed below are not exhaustive 

risks related to our brand and certain intellectual property rights   

our business depends on our strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands and develop a positive client reputation could hurt our ability to retain and expand our base of customers 

our strong brands rollins orkin hometeam clark pest control western northwest ifc crane pest control waltham trutech permatreat critter control safeguard pest control aardwolf pestkare opc and other strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing our brands increases our ability to enter new markets and launch new and innovative services that better serve the needs of our customers our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including among others reputational issues and producttechnical failures further if our brands are significantly damaged our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected we continue to develop strategies and innovative tools to gain a deeper understanding of customer acquisition retention and client replacement in order to more effectively expand and retain our customer base maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a service leader and continue to provide highquality pest control services that are truly beneficial and play a meaningful role in people’s lives 

our brand recognition could be impacted if we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business 

our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to service marks trademarks trade names and other intellectual property rights we own or license particularly our registered brand names and service marks orkin ®  orkin canada ®  hometeam pest defense ®  taexx ®  clark pest control ®  western pest services ®  northwest exterminating ®  critter control ®  ifc ®  trutech ®  waltham pest services ®  opc services® perma treat pest and termite control ®  crane pest control ®  murray pest control® allpest ®  statewide pest control ®  safeguard the pest control people ®  aardwolf pestkare ®  adams pest control™ mccall ® and others although we have sought to register or protect many of our marks either in the united states or in the countries in which they are or may be used we have not sought to protect our marks in every country furthermore because of the differences in foreign trademark patent and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws we may not receive the same protection in other countries as we would in the united states if we are unable to protect our proprietary information and brand names we could suffer a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information or to defend against claims by third parties that our products services or activities infringe their intellectual property rights 





our franchisees subcontractors and vendors could take actions that could harm our business 

our franchisees subcontractors and vendors are contractually obligated to operate their businesses in accordance with the standards set forth in our agreements with them and applicable laws and regulations each franchised brand also provides training and support to franchisees however franchisees subcontractors and vendors are independent third parties that we do not control and who own operate and oversee the daily operations of their businesses as a result the ultimate success of any franchise operation rests with the franchisee if franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required standards royalty payments to us will be adversely affected and our brands’ image and reputation could be harmed this could materially adversely impact our business financial position results of operations and cash flows similarly if subcontractors vendors and franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required laws standards and regulations we could be subject to claims from regulators or legal claims for the actions or omissions of such thirdparty distributors subcontractors vendors and franchisees in addition our relationship with our franchisees subcontractors and vendors could become strained including resulting in litigation as we impose new standards or assert more rigorous enforcement practices of the existing required standards these strains in our relationships or claims could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time we receive communications from our franchisees regarding complaints disputes or questions about our practices and standards in relation to our franchised operations and certain economic terms of our franchise arrangements if franchisees or groups representing franchisees were to bring legal proceedings against us we would vigorously defend against the claims in any such proceeding our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted and the price of our common stock could decline 

risks related to the global economy and public health crises 

economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business 

pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers if consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers including food service hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies for example we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider 

our business results of operations and financial condition is impacted by the coronavirus covid19 pandemic and the restrictions put in place in connection therewith 

we have and continue to respond to the global outbreak of covid19 by taking steps to mitigate the potential risks posed to us by its spread and the impact of the restrictions put in place by the local state and federal governments to protect the population however the resurgence of the covid19 pandemic in key areas of our operations may require us to implement additional restrictions on our operations we continue to execute our business continuity plan and have implemented a comprehensive set of new protocols for the health and safety of our employees customers and business partners such as wearing masks gloves and other personal protective equipment social distancing utilizing electronic documents and sanitizing high touch surfaces among others our employees transitioned to workfromhome during fiscal 2020 where appropriate however due to the speed and scope with which the covid19 situation has evolved and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery we are not able at this time to predict the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition in addition the unprecedented uncertainty surrounding covid19 due to rapidly changing governmental directives public health challenges and progress macroeconomic consequences and market reactions thereto also makes it more challenging for our management to estimate the future performance of our business and develop strategies to generate growth or achieve our objectives for 2021 and beyond 

risks related to our labor force 

our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability 

our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain sales and service operations professional workers develop leadership and implement diversity equity and inclusion initiatives our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force the demand for employees is high and the supply is limited a significant increase in the wages paid and benefits offered by competing employers could result in a reduction in our labor force increases in our labor costs or both if either of paid these events occurred our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired 





risks related to our business industry and operations 

we face risks regarding our ability to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues and earnings are affected by changes in competitors’ prices and general economic issues we compete with other large pest control companies as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality terms of guarantees reputation for safety technical proficiency and price although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service are excellent we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain our competitive position 

we may not be able to identify complete or successfully integrate acquisitions 

acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy we cannot assure investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future we cannot assure investors that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

expanding into international markets presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations may not be successful 

an element of our strategy includes further expansion into international markets our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by political economic and social conditions beyond our control local laws and customs and legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with applicable anticorruption and currency laws and regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an adverse effect on the financial results of our international operations 

our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions 

our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions worldwide the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the company’s pest and termite control services the increase in pest presence and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods the business of the company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods 





risks related to cybersecurity privacy compliance and business disruptions 

the company and its whollyowned subsidiaries could suffer disruption to business operations and face economic and reputational damage as well as be subject to fines penalties and private litigation if there is unauthorized access to or unintentional distribution of personal financial proprietary confidential or other protected data or information the company is entrusted to keep about its customers employees business practices or third parties 

our internal information technology “it” systems contain certain personal financial health or other protected and confidential information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees our it systems also contain the company’s and its whollyowned subsidiaries’ proprietary and other confidential information related to our business such as business plans customer lists and product and service development initiatives we also grant thirdparty business partners and service providers access to such information in order to facilitate business operations and administer benefits employees thirdparty business partners and service providers can knowingly or unknowingly disseminate such information or serve as an entry point for bad actors to access such information vulnerabilities from growth acquisitions and integration with new systems also exist 

our privacy compliance and digital risk management initiatives focus on the threats and risks to enterprise information and the underlying it systems processing such information as part of the implementation of business processes the company also relies on among other things commercially available vendors cyber protection systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of protected information and data the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk meet standards set by the payment card industry “pci” we have also implemented policies and procedures internal training system controls and constant monitoring and audit processes to protect the company from internal and external vulnerabilities and to comply with consumer privacy laws in the areas in which we operate further the company limits retention of certain data encrypts certain data and otherwise protects information to comply with consumer privacy laws in the areas in which we operate 

we continue to evaluate and modify our systems and protocols for data security compliance purposes and such standards may change from time to time we monitor certain thirdparty business partners and service providers for compliance and vulnerabilities activities by bad actors changes in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology new tools and discoveries cloud applications changes in multijurisdictional regulations and other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of our systems any compromises breaches application errors or human mistakes related to our systems or failures to comply with applicable standards could not only disrupt our financial operations including our customers’ ability to pay for our services and products by credit card or their willingness to purchase our services and products but could also result in violations of applicable laws regulations orders industry standards or agreements and subject us to costs penalties and liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows furthermore a breach of data security or failure to comply with rigorous multijurisdictional consumer privacy requirements could expose us to customer litigation regulatory actions and costs related to the reporting and handling of such a violation or breach 

risks related to legal regulatory and risk management matters 

we are from time to time subject to lawsuits investigations and other proceedings which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our operations may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with applicable law or other governmental regulations including environmental and other regulations relating to the pest control industry 





in the normal course of business we are involved in various claims arbitrations contractual disputes investigations and litigation including claims that our services or vehicles caused damage or injury claims that our services did not achieve the desired results claims related to acquisitions allegations by federal state or local authorities including the sec of violations of regulations or statutes claims related to wage and hour law violations and claims related to environmental matters these claims proceedings or litigation either alone or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally our business is significantly affected by and subject to regulation by various federal state provincial regional and local governments in the countries in which we operate including but not limited to environmental laws antitrust laws consumer protection laws employment laws including wage and hour laws payroll taxes and antidiscrimination laws immigration human health and safety laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry 

we are unable to predict whether such laws will in the future materially affect our operations and financial condition or whether any changes will require us to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such changes penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including but not limited to cancellation of licenses fines and other corrective actions which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the ongoing sec investigation and any potential related litigation entail risks and uncertainties 

the sec is conducting an investigation which the company believes is primarily focused on how it established accruals and reserves at periodends and the impact of those accruals and reserves on reported earnings the investigation relates to periodends for periods beginning january 1 2015 the company is fully cooperating with the sec’s investigation the company’s audit committee retained independent counsel to conduct an internal investigation into matters related to the sec investigation and in particular the company’s processes for establishing and adjusting reserves for each quarter in the relevant periods the internal investigation was concluded in october 2020 based on the results of the internal investigation it was determined that there was a significant deficiency in the company’s internal controls relating to the documentation and review of accounting entries for certain reserves and accruals the company has subsequently reevaluated and strengthened its internal controls over financial reporting including improving processes and procedures and supporting documentation and providing additional training which has resulted in the remediation of the significant deficiency the company after consultation with the audit committee and independent counsel believes that its financial statements filed with the sec on forms 10k and 10q for the relevant periods fairly present in all material respects its financial condition results of operations and cash flows as of their respective balance sheet dates and for the periods then ended 

the sec’s investigation is ongoing however and there can be no assurance that the sec or another regulatory body will not make further regulatory inquiries or pursue action against the company and its senior officers that could result in potentially significant sanctions and penalties or that could require the company to take additional remedial steps potential sanctions against the company andor individuals could include penalties injunctions and ceaseanddesist orders further the company may be subject to litigation from third parties related to the matters under review by the sec accordingly the ongoing sec investigation and any potential related litigation could result in distraction to management and entail risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could adversely affect our financial results and our reputation 

  

product service or other related liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial position and results of operations   

the handling storage transportation and use of chemical products required to provide pest control service involves inherent exposure to potential product liability claims service level claims and related adverse publicity additionally hazards could potentially cause injury damage to or destruction of property or equipment and environmental contamination or other environmental damage which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations also the occurrence of disruptions shutdowns or other material operating problems at our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers due to any of these risks could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole including our results of operations and cash flows both during and after the period of operational difficulties we maintain product and general liability insurance however there can be no assurance that the types or levels of coverage maintained are adequate to cover these potential significant and catastrophic risks in addition we may not be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance coverage or obtain comparable or additional insurance coverage at a reasonable cost if at all in the event a significant product or service claim arises 





our risk management and safety programs may not have the intended effect of reducing our liability for personal injury or property loss   

our safety record is critical to our reputation many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to provide service and bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures accordingly if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards we could suffer reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we attempt to mitigate risks relating to personal injury or property loss through the implementation of companywide safety management efforts designed to decrease the incidence of accidents or events that may occur it is expected that any such decreases could also have the effect of reducing our insurance costs however incidents involving injury or property loss may be caused by multiple potential factors a significant number of which are beyond our control therefore there is no guarantee that our risk management and safety programs will have the desired effect of controlling all potential costs and liability exposure 

our enterprise risk management program may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks 

we maintain an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify assess mitigate and monitor the risks that we face there can be no assurance that our frameworks or models for assessing and managing known risks compliance with applicable law and related controls will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in all market environments or against all types of known and unknown risk in our business if conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in our risk management or compliance programs the performance and value of our business could be materially adversely affected 

the company maintains insurance and other traditional riskshifting tools to manage certain types of risks however such tools are subject to terms such as deductibles retentions limits and policy exclusions as well as risk of denial of coverage default or insolvency if we suffer unexpected or uncovered losses or if any of our insurance policies are terminated for any reason or are not effective in mitigating our risks we may incur losses that are not covered or that exceed our coverage limits and could adversely impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

risks related to our capital and ownership structure 

the company’s management has a substantial ownership interest public stockholders may have no effective voice in the company’s management 

the company has elected the “controlled company” exemption under section 303a of the new york stock exchange “nyse” listed company manual the company is a “controlled company” because a group that includes the company’s chairman of the board and chief executive officer gary w rollins and certain companies under his control controls in excess of fifty percent of the company’s voting power as a “controlled company” the company need not comply with certain nyse rules 

rollins inc’s executive officers directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership in the aggregate approximately 54 percent of the company’s outstanding shares of common stock as a result these persons will effectively control the operations of the company including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company at a premium 





our management has a substantial ownership interest and the availability of the company’s common stock to the investing public may be limited 

the availability of rollins’ common stock to the investing public would be limited to those shares not held by the executive officers directors and their affiliates which could negatively impact rollins’ stock trading prices and affect the ability of minority stockholders to sell their shares future sales by executive officers directors and their affiliates of all or a portion of their shares could also negatively affect the trading price of our common stock 

provisions in rollins inc’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover of the company 

rollins inc’s certificate of incorporation bylaws and other documents contain provisions including advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and staggered terms for the board of directors these provisions may make a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors more difficult or expensive

overview 

results of operations 

   

general operating comments   

2020 marked the company’s 23rd consecutive year of increased revenues revenues for the year rose 72 percent to 2161 billion compared to 2015 billion for the prior year income before income taxes increased 358 to 3547 million compared to 2612 million the prior year net income increased 283 to 2608 million with earnings per diluted share of 053 compared to 2033 million or 041 per diluted share for the prior year the drop in net income from 2018 to 2019 was primarily attributed to the pension settlement loss recorded in 2019 

covid19 pandemic impact 

as the pandemic challenges grew early in 2020 the company made numerous operational adjustments to address the economic health and safety challenges from the covid19 pandemic these included new covidrelated procedures modified customer service and related protocols daily health screenings before entering shared offices and a transition to remote work locations to reduce concentrations of personnel in offices where appropriate cost containment efforts included furloughs layoffs elimination of nonessential travel postponing capital expenditures and temporary salary reductions for upper management among other actions 

customer retention during the pandemic is less predictable and of greater immediate concern compared with our normal operations however our residential pest and termite control business has remained reasonably consistent with some growth over prior years with many sheltering or working from home we have experienced higher than normal demand for our residential services our commercial pest control business has been more adversely impacted as it crosses multiple industries such as healthcare food processing logistics grocery retail and hospitality each of these industries is being impacted differently by the pandemic many of our commercial customers continue to operate as “essential” businesses however unfortunately there are a notable number of others that have closed at least temporarily we expect this impact will persist through much of 2021 until the majority of the population has been vaccinated against the virus the company’s residential and termite revenues grew 134 and 96 respectively in 2020 compared to 2019 while our commercial pest control revenues fell by 05 





while we have a substantial amount of intangible assets on our balance sheet based on our revenue growth this year we do not anticipate any significant longterm loss in revenues or cash flows that would approach a level for impairment of intangible assets 

all of our critical supplychain vendors have remained operational and we have engaged additional new sources to supplement our existing suppliers especially for critical ppe and other covid19 related items fleet suppliers and support vendors continue to serve our needs 

  

results of operations—2020 versus 2019 

overview 

the company’s revenues increased to 2161 billion in 2020 a 72 increase compared to 2019 gross margin increased to 515 for 2020 from 507 in 2019 sales general and administrative expense were 304 of revenues in 2020 compared to 309 in 2019 the company’s depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of revenue increased 25 to 41 in 2020 compared to 40 in 2019 rollins’ net income of 2608 million in 2020 was an increase of 575 million or 283 compared to 2033 million in 2019 net profit margin improved to 121 in 2020 from 101 in 2019 rollins continued to expand our global brand recognition with acquisitions in the united states canada united kingdom australia and asia as well as expanded our orkin international franchise program in numerous countries around the globe the company continues to seek new international opportunities 

revenues 

revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 were 2161 billion an increase of 1457 million or 72 from 2019 revenues of 2015 billion growth accounted for approximately 38 of our increase and our acquisitions contributed the remaining revenue growth we experienced strong growth in residential pest control increasing 134 while termite and ancillary revenues grew 96 year over year commercial revenues were down 05 as commercial pest control was negatively impacted by the covid19 virus due to various levels of governmentdriven shutdowns the company’s revenue mix for the year ended december 31 2020 consisted primarily of 45 residential pest control 36 commercial pest control and 19 termite and ancillary revenues such as moisture control insulation deck and gutter work 

during 2020 the company chose to forgo the normal midyear price increase which historically contributes approximately 10 to our annual revenue growth approximately 80 of the company’s pest control revenue was recurring in 2020 as well as in 2019 

the company’s foreign operations accounted for approximately 7 and 8 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the company established new franchises in several international countries around the globe in 2020 while closing or acquiring others for a total of 94 orkin international franchises and nine australia franchises at december 31 2020 compared to 97 orkin international franchises one canadian critter control franchises and ten australia franchises at december 31 2019 the australia franchises operate under the murray pest control and scientific pest management names 

revenue from franchising was up 56 in 2020 compared to 2019 as the company continued to expand orkin’s international footprint and recognition of initial franchise fees international and domestic franchising revenue was less than 1 of the company’s revenues for 2020 orkin had 143 and 147 franchises domestic and international at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the company continued its strategy of buying back critter control franchises during 2020 resulting in a drop in franchises to 79 at december 31 2020 compared to 85 at december 31 2019 

cost of services provided 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 cost of services provided increased 550 million or 55 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2019 gross margin for the year increased to 515 for 2020 from 507 in 2019 margin improvements were driven primarily from lower service wage growth compared to revenue growth and from fleet savings driven by improvements in our routing and scheduling efficiencies and lower fuel prices 





depreciation and amortization 

  

for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 depreciation and amortization increased 72 million or 89 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2019 the dollar increase was primarily due to depreciation increasing 40 million or 109 from the depreciation of acquired and purchased assets and depreciation from various it related projects amortization of intangible assets increased 32 million or 73 for 2020 due to the additional amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions over the last year including a full year of amortization for clark pest control acquired in april 2019 as well as several smaller foreign and domestic companies 

sales general and administrative 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 sales general and administrative sga expenses increased 328 million or 53 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2019 sga decreased to 304 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 309 in 2019 the company eliminated any nonessential spending at the start of the pandemic which lowered expenses in several areas travel restrictions reduced typical training site visits and conference costs conversely we incurred higher than normal expenses in 2019 related to acquisition preparation and integration activities for clark pest control

the company recorded a 16 million net loss on sales of assets for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to a net gain on sales of assets of 06 million in 2019 the company’s 2020 losses came primarily from liquidating the pension plan assets from the 2019 pension plan settlement during 2019 the company recorded gains from the sale of owned vehicles and other owned property 

  

interest expense net 

interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 was 51 million and 69 million respectively driven largely by borrowings to fund acquisitions among other things 

taxes 

  

the company’s effective tax rate increased to 265 in 2020 compared to 221 in 2019 due primarily to state and foreign income tax changes and limited tax deductibility for the accelerated stock vesting expense recognized in 2020 the 2019 rate was lower due to beneficial adjustments related to the 2019 pension settlement

off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments   

the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows 

   critical accounting policies and estimates   

the company views critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management’s most difficult complex or subjective judgments the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows 





accrual for termite contracts —the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications repairs and associated labor and chemicals settlements awards and other costs relative to termite control services factors that may impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company’s business practices however it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the company’s consolidated statements of financial position 

accrued insurance— the company retains up to specified limits certain risks related to general liability workers’ compensation and auto liability risks are managed through either high deductible insurance or a nonaffiliated group captive insurance member arrangement the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims the company contracts with an independent thirdparty actuary on a semiannual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve along with management’s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances management’s judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control additionally historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events the company continues to be proactive in safety and risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce and prevent claims initiatives that have been implemented include required preemployment screening and ongoing motor vehicle record review for all drivers postoffer physicals for new employees prehire random and post incident drug testing increased driver training and postinjury nurse triage for workrelated injuries the accruals and reserves we hold are based on estimates that involve a degree of judgment and are inherently variable and could be overestimated or insufficient if actual claims exceed our estimates our operating results could be materially affected and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited 

  

revenue recognition— the company’s revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services each of which are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations revenue is recognized net of allowances for refunds and any taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities 

more on the company’s revenue recognition policy can be found in the company’s notes to the consolidated financial statements note 1  summary of significant accounting policies with the heading revenue recognition 

contingency accruals —the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 450 “contingencies” management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued however in the opinion of management the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the company’s consolidated statements of financial position

 item 1a risk factors 

our business depends on our strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands and develop a positive client reputation could hurt our ability to retain and expand our base of customers 

our strong brands rollins orkin hometeam pest defense clark pest control western pest services northwest pest control the industrial fumigant company crane pest control waltham services trutech permatreat critter control safeguard pest control aardwolf pestkare opc services and other strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing our brands increases our ability to enter new markets and launch new and innovative services that better serve the needs of our customers our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including among others reputational issues and producttechnical failures further if our brands are significantly damaged our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected we continue to develop strategies and innovative tools to gain a deeper understanding of customer acquisition retention and client replacement in order to more effectively expand and retain our customer base maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a service leader and continue to provide highquality pest control services that are truly beneficial and play a meaningful role in people’s lives 

  

economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers if consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers including food service hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies for example we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider 

expanding into international markets presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations may not be successful 

an element of our strategy includes further expansion into international markets our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by political economic and social conditions beyond our control local laws and customs and legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with applicable anticorruption and currency laws and regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an adverse effect on the financial results of our international operations 





our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability 

our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force the demand for skilled employees is high and the supply is very limited a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force increases in wage rates paid by us or both if either of these events occurred our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired 

we may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitors’ prices and general economic issues we compete with other large pest control companies as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality product availability terms of guarantees reputation for safety technical proficiency and price although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service are excellent we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain our competitive position 

  

our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation 

in the normal course of business we and some of our subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged the company does not believe that any pending claim proceeding or litigation either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position however it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters however unlikely could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual year 

our operations could be affected if there is unauthorized access of personal financial or other data or information about our customers employees third parties or of the company’s proprietary of confidential information we could be subject to interruption of our business operations private litigation reputational damage and costly penalties 

  

our information technology systems as well as the information technology systems of our thirdparty business partners and service providers can contain personal financial health or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees our information technology systems also contain the company’s and its whollyowned subsidiaries’ proprietary and other confidential information related to our business such as business plans and product development initiatives we rely on among other things commercially available vendors cyber protection systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of this information and data the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk meet standards set by the payment card industry “pci” we have also implemented policies and procedures to comply with consumer privacy laws in the areas in which we operate we continue to evaluate and modify our systems and protocols for data security compliance purposes and such standards may change from time to time activities by third parties advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our systems any compromises breaches or errors in applications related to our systems or failures to comply with applicable standards could cause damage to our reputation and interruptions in our operations including our customers’ ability to pay for our services and products by credit card or their willingness to purchase our services and products and could result in a violation of applicable laws regulations orders industry standards or agreements and subject us to costs penalties and liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows also a breach of data security or failure to comply with rigorous consumer privacy requirements could expose us to customer litigation regulatory actions and costs related to the reporting and handling of such a violation or breach 





our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws 

our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws we are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted we believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations we also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date however such environmental laws are changed frequently we are unable to predict whether environmental laws will in the future materially affect our operations and financial condition penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses fines and other corrective actions which would negatively affect our future financial results 

we may not be able to identify complete or successfully integrate acquisitions 

acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy we cannot assure investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future we cannot assure investors that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions 

our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions worldwide the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the company’s pest and termite control services the increase in pest presence and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods the business of the company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods 

our franchisees subcontractors and vendors could take actions that could harm our business 

our franchisees subcontractors and vendors are contractually obligated to operate their businesses in accordance with the standards set forth in our agreements with them and applicable laws and regulations each franchising brand also provides training and support to franchisees however franchisees subcontractors and vendors are independent third parties that we do not control and who own operate and oversee the daily operations of their businesses as a result the ultimate success of any franchise operation rests with the franchisee if franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required standards royalty payments to us will be adversely affected and our brands’ image and reputation could be harmed this could adversely impact our business financial position results of operations and cash flows similarly if subcontractors vendors and franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required laws standards and regulations we could be subject to claims from regulators or legal claims for the actions or omissions of such thirdparty distributors subcontractors vendors and franchisees in addition our relationship with our franchisees subcontractors and vendors could become strained including resulting in litigation as we impose new standards or assert more rigorous enforcement practices of the existing required standards these strains in our relationships or claims could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time we receive communications from our franchisees regarding complaints disputes or questions about our practices and standards in relation to our franchised operations and certain economic terms of our franchise arrangements if franchisees or groups representing franchisees were to bring legal proceedings against us we would vigorously defend against the claims in any such proceeding our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted and the price of our common stock could decline 





our brand recognition could be impacted if we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business 

our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to service marks trademarks trade names and other intellectual property rights we own or license particularly our registered brand names and service marks orkin ®  orkin canada ®  hometeam pest defense ®  taexx ®  clark pest control ®  western pest services ®  northwest exterminating ®  critter control ®  ifc ®  trutech ®  waltham pest services ®  opc services® perma treat pest and termite control ®  crane pest control ®  safeguard the pest control people® aardwolf pest control® and others we have not sought to register or protect every one of our marks either in the united states or in every country in which they are or may be used furthermore because of the differences in foreign trademark patent and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws we may not receive the same protection in other countries as we would in the united states if we are unable to protect our proprietary information and brand names we could suffer a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information or to defend against claims by third parties that our products services or activities infringe their intellectual property rights 

the company’s management has a substantial ownership interest public stockholders may have no effective voice in the company’s management 

the company has elected the “controlled company” exemption under section 303a of the new york stock exchange “nyse” listed company manual the company is a “controlled company” because a group that includes the company’s chairman of the board r randall rollins and his brother gary w rollins who is the vice chairman and chief executive officer and a director of the company and certain companies under their control controls in excess of fifty percent of the company’s voting power as a “controlled company” the company need not comply with certain nyse rules 

rollins inc’s executive officers directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership in the aggregate approximately 57 percent of the company’s outstanding shares of common stock as a result these persons will effectively control the operations of the company including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company at a premium 

our management has a substantial ownership interest and the availability of the company’s common stock to the investing public may be limited 

the availability of rollins’ common stock to the investing public would be limited to those shares not held by the executive officers directors and their affiliates which could negatively impact rollins’ stock trading prices and affect the ability of minority stockholders to sell their shares future sales by executive officers directors and their affiliates of all or a portion of their shares could also negatively affect the trading price of our common stock 

provisions in rollins inc’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover of the company 

rollins inc’s certificate of incorporation bylaws and other documents contain provisions including advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and staggered terms for the board of directors these provisions may make a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors more difficult or expensive

revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 were 2015 billion an increase of 194 million or 106 from 2018 revenues of 1822 billion growth occurred across all service lines with our canadian and australian companies being hindered by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates growth and pricing accounted for approximately 48 of our increase and our acquisitions contributed the remaining revenue growth commercial pest control represented approximately 38 of the company’s revenue in 2019 and grew 89 acquisitions from foreign companies which are primarily commercial contributed to the increase as well as increases in sales an emphasis on closing leads and better cancellation rates commercial pest control was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates as our foreign companies are heavily commercial residential pest control which represented approximately 43 of the company’s revenue increased 113 driven largely by the clark pest control acquisition which is mainly residential other factors such as increases in leads received leads sold a lower cancellation rate and pricing as well as increased taexx ® homebuilder installations also contributed to the increase in residential pest control revenue the company’s termite business which represented approximately 18 of the company’s revenue grew 116 in 2019 due to acquisitions increases in termite baiting and ancillary service sales such as moisture control insulation and deck and gutter work 





the company implemented its traditional price increase program in june 2019 around 1 of the company’s revenue increase is attributable to pricing actions approximately 80 of the company’s pest control revenue was recurring in 2019 as well as 2018

off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments 

the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows 

   critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company views critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management’s most difficult complex or subjective judgments the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows 

accrual for termite contracts —the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications repairs and associated labor and chemicals settlements awards and other costs relative to termite control services factors that may impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company’s business practices however it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the company’s consolidated statements of financial position 

accrued insurance— the company retains up to specified limits certain risks related to general liability workers’ compensation and vehicle liability risks above specified limits are managed through either high deductible insurance or a nonaffiliated group captive insurance member arrangement the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims the company contracts with an independent thirdparty actuary on a semiannual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve along with management’s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances management’s judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control additionally historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events the company continues to be proactive in safety and risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims initiatives that have been implemented include required preemployment screening and ongoing motor vehicle record review for all drivers postoffer physicals for new employees prehire random and post incident drug testing increased driver training and postinjury nurse triage for workrelated injuries 





revenue recognition— the company’s revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services each of which are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities 

more on the company’s revenue recognition policy can be found in the company’s notes to the consolidated financial statements note 1 – summary of significant accounting policies with the heading revenue recognition 

contingency accruals —the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 450 “contingencies” management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued however in the opinion of management the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the company’s consolidated statements of financial position 

defined benefit pension plans — the company had two defined benefit pension plans the rollins inc defined benefit plan and the waltham services llc hourly employee pension plan 

the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins inc defined benefit plan in 2005 but remained obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june 2005 during 2018 the company initiated the process to transition its pension plan to an insurance provider at december 31 2018 the company utilized a termination liability approach this approach reflected the estimated impact of the distribution of benefits due to a standard termination plan liabilities were to be settled through the purchase of annuities from an insurance provider or through the distribution of lump sum payments to eligible participants that elected to receive such a form of payment discount rates of 390 per year for participants in pay status and 411 per year for participants with deferred benefits were selected by the plan sponsor to determine the benefit obligation resulting from plan termination annuity purchases the discount rates reflected the single effective interest rate that produced the same present value as that produced when the expected future cash flows for participants expected to elect an annuity were discounted with the ftse yield curve formerly citigroup as of the measurement date to determine the benefit obligation resulting from plan termination lump sum payments the expected future cash flows for lump sum eligible participants determined with the irc 417e mortality table for 2019 were discounted with the irc 417e segment interest rates for the month of november 2018 343 446 and 488 only 50 of active 30 of deferred vested and 25 of retired participants that were eligible to receive a lump sum distribution of their pension benefit upon plan termination were assumed to elect this form of payment

the plan was settled during 2019 through a combination of lump sum payments to participants the purchase of a group annuity contract and payments to the pension benefit guaranty corporation 

the company’s sole remaining defined benefit pension plan is the waltham services llc hourly employee pension plan this plan was amended effective september 1 2018 to freeze future benefit accruals for all participants the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the fasb asc topic 715 “compensation retirement benefits” and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs with the assistance of the actuary the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets the discount rate and other factors and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 





the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes the investments strategy and the views of our investment adviser differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years therefore the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects future pension expense the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 70 which is unchanged from the prior year 

waltham services llc hourly employees pension plan utilizes a yield curve approach the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the company’s expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds the discount rate was 470 as of december 31 2019 compared to 405 in both 2018 and 2017 a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligation 

as set forth in note 16 to the company’s financial statements included among the asset categories for the plan’s investments are real estate tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds these investments are categorized as investments at net asset value “nav” and are valued using significant nonobservable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value in accordance with accounting standards update “asu” no 200912 “ investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent” these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness  

the waltham services llc hourly employee pension plan had a net pension liability of 08 million and 06 million at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders’ equity by 756 million before tax and 459 million after tax driven mainly by the rollins inc defined benefit plan settlement

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states “pcaob” the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 based on criteria established in the 2013 internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” and our report dated february 28 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion

 

change in accounting principle 

as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of january 1 2019 due to the adoption of accounting standards codification topic 842 leases  

 

basis for opinion 

these financial statements are the responsibility of the company’s management our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s financial statements based on our audits we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the us federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob 

 

we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement whether due to error or fraud our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks such procedures included examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

critical audit matters 

the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that 1 relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and 2 involved our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matters below providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate

 

business combinations – acquisition of clark pest control of stockton inc 

as described further in notes 1 and 2 to the company’s consolidated financial statements the company completed the acquisition of clark pest control of stockton inc “clark” on april 30 2019 the company allocated the purchase price to the identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values we identified the company’s determination of the fair value of the identified intangible assets acquired in the clark acquisition as a critical audit matter

 

the principal considerations for our determination that the fair value of identified intangible assets in the acquisition of clark is a critical audit matter are because of the significant estimates management makes to determine their fair value this requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort including the need to involve our valuation specialists when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to the discount rates customer attrition and revenue growth projections 

 

our audit procedures related to the determination of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in the clark acquisition included the following among others we tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the accounting for the clark acquisition which included the models used to determine the fair value of major classes of intangible assets along with any contingent consideration liabilities we inspected the purchase agreement for this acquisition we utilized valuation specialists to assess the reasonableness of the significant assumptions utilized by management within the models we recalculated the calculation and support for the opening entry and subsequent recording of the entry for the clark acquisition 





accrued insurance 

as described further in note 1 to the financial statements rollins inc the “company” retains up to certain policyspecified limits certain risks related to general liability workers’ compensation and vehicle and equipment liability costs the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims we identified accrued insurance reserves and related expenses “accrued insurance” as a critical audit matter 

 

the principal considerations for our determination that accrued insurance is a critical audit matter are that the accrual for accrued insurance has higher risk of estimation uncertainty due to the loss development factors and inherent assumptions in actuarial methods used in determining the required reserves the estimation uncertainty and complexity of the actuarial methods utilized resulted in auditor judgment when assessing if management’s accrual for accrued insurance was determined utilizing a reasonable basis and was materially correct 

 

our audit procedures related to the accrued insurance reserves included the following among others 

 

     

implementation of asc 842 

as more fully described in note 1 to the financial statements the company adopted asc 842 leases as of january 1 2019 which resulted in the recognition of a rightofuse asset “rou asset” and a lease liability for operating leases other than leases that meet the definition of a shortterm lease at the commencement of the lease term the liability is equal to the present value of future lease payments the asset will be based on the liability subject to certain adjustments including initial direct costs and lessor provided incentives we identified adoption of asc 842 as a critical audit matter driven primarily by the significant judgment in establishing the lease liability and rou asset – specifically the discount rate to apply to the future lease payments 

 

we identified the adoption of asc 842 as a critical audit matter because it is a substantial change in accounting for leases and as such requires significant auditor judgment in obtaining sufficient and appropriate audit evidence related to management’s determination of the lease liability and rou asset and their selection of a discount rate to be applied to future lease payments 

 

our audit procedures related to the adoption of asc 842 include the following among others we tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the initial adoption of asc 842 and ongoing accounting for new leases obtained during the period we evaluated the independent auditor’s report on operating effectiveness of controls at the company’s third party lease software vendor which included testing the design and operating effectiveness of the relevant user controls due to the company’s reliance on the third party software to appropriately calculate the related rou asset and lease liability we verified the completeness of the population of leases that management evaluated as part of the initial impact of adoption and the ongoing accounting we inspected a sample of lease contracts validated the relevant inputs to the lease software and recalculated the software’s calculation of the rou asset and lease liability we performed procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of the discount rate used by the company in establishing the rou asset and lease liability which included the use of a specialist to evaluate the reasonableness of the discount rate used by management in the initial measurement of the lease liability

 item 1a risk factors 

our business depends on our strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands could hurt our ability to retain and expand our base of customers 

our strong brands rollins orkin hometeam pest defense western pest services northwest pest control the industrial fumigant company crane pest control waltham services trutech permatreat critter control allpest safeguard pest control aardwolf pestkare opc services and other strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing our brands increases our ability to enter new markets and launch new and innovative services that better serve the needs of our customers our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including among others reputational issues and producttechnical failures further if our brands are significantly damaged our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a service leader and continue to provide highquality pest control products and services that are truly useful and play a meaningful role in people’s lives 

  

economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers as consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers including food service hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies for example we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider 

expanding into international markets presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations may not be successful 

an element of our strategy includes further expansion into international markets our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by political economic and social conditions beyond our control local laws and customs and legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with applicable anticorruption and currency laws and regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations thereof may have an adverse effect on the financial results of our international operations 





our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability 

our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force the demand for skilled employees is high and the supply is very limited a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force increases in wage rates paid by us or both if either of these events occurred our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired 

we may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitors’ prices and general economic issues we compete with other large pest control companies as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality and product availability terms of guarantees reputation for safety technical proficiency and price although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service are excellent we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain our competitive position 

  

our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation 

in the normal course of business some of the company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged the company does not believe that any pending claim proceeding or litigation either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position however it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters however unlikely could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual year 

our operations could be affected if there is unauthorized access of personal financial or other data or information about our customers employees third parties or of company’s proprietary of confidential information we could be subject to interruption of our business operations private litigation reputational damage and costly penalties 

  

our information technology systems as well as the information technology systems of our third party business partners and service providers can contain personal financial health or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees our information technology systems also contain company’s and its whollyowned subsidiaries’ proprietary and other confidential information related to our business such as business plans and product development initiatives we rely on among other things commercially available vendors cyber protection systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of this information and data the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk meet standards set by the payment card industry “pci” we continue to evaluate and modify our systems and protocols for data security compliance purposes and such standards may change from time to time activities by third parties advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our systems any compromises breaches or errors in applications related to our systems or failures to comply with applicable standards could cause damage to our reputation and interruptions in our operations including our customers’ ability to pay for our services and products by credit card or their willingness to purchase our services and products and could result in a violation of applicable laws regulations orders industry standards or agreements and subject us to costs penalties and liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows also a breach of data security could expose us to customer litigation and costs related to the reporting and handling of such a breach 





our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws 

our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws we are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted we believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations we also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date however such environmental laws are changed frequently we are unable to predict whether environmental laws will in the future materially affect our operations and financial condition penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses fines and other corrective actions which would negatively affect our future financial results 

we may not be able to identify complete or successfully integrate acquisitions 

acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy we cannot assure investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future we cannot assure investors that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions 

our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions worldwide the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the company’s pest and termite control services the increase in pest presence and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods the business of the company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods 

our franchisees subcontractors and vendors could take actions that could harm our business 

our franchisees subcontractors and vendors are contractually obligated to operate their businesses in accordance with the standards set forth in our agreements with them each franchising brand also provides training and support to franchisees however franchisees subcontractors and vendors are independent third parties that we do not control and who own operate and oversee the daily operations of their businesses as a result the ultimate success of any franchise operation rests with the franchisee if franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required standards royalty payments to us will be adversely affected and our brands’ image and reputation could be harmed this could adversely impact our business financial position results of operations and cash flows similarly if subcontractors vendors and franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required laws standards and regulations we could be subject to claims from regulators or legal claims for the actions or omissions of such thirdparty distributors subcontractors vendors and franchisees in addition our relationship with our franchisees subcontractors and vendors could become strained including resulting in litigation as we impose new standards or assert more rigorous enforcement practices of the existing required standards these strains in our relationships or claims could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time we receive communications from our franchisees regarding complaints disputes or questions about our practices and standards in relation to our franchised operations and certain economic terms of our franchise arrangements if franchisees or groups representing franchisees were to bring legal proceedings against us we would vigorously defend against the claims in any such proceeding our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted and the price of our common stock could decline 





our brand recognition could be impacted if we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business 

our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to service marks trademarks trade names and other intellectual property rights we own or license particularly our registered brand names and service marks orkin ®  orkin canada ®  acurid sm  western pest services ®  the industrial fumigant company ®  hometeam pest defense ®  taexx ®  critter control ®  northwest pest control ®  allpest ®  murray ®  safeguard ® and others we have not sought to register or protect every one of our marks either in the united states or in every country in which they are or may be used furthermore because of the differences in foreign trademark patent and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws we may not receive the same protection in other countries as we would in the united states if we are unable to protect our proprietary information and brand names we could suffer a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information or to defend against claims by third parties that our products services or activities infringe their intellectual property rights 

the company’s management has a substantial ownership interest public stockholders may have no effective voice in the company’s management 

the company has elected the “controlled company” exemption under section 303a of the new york stock exchange “nyse” listed company manual the company is a “controlled company” because a group that includes the company’s chairman of the board r randall rollins and his brother gary w rollins who is the vice chairman and chief executive officer and a director of the company and certain companies under their control controls in excess of fifty percent of the company’s voting power as a “controlled company” the company need not comply with certain nyse rules 

rollins inc’s executive officers directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership in the aggregate approximately 56 percent of the company’s outstanding shares of common stock as a result these persons will effectively control the operations of the company including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company at a premium 

our management has a substantial ownership interest and the availability of the company’s common stock to the investing public may be limited 

the availability of rollins’ common stock to the investing public would be limited to those shares not held by the executive officers directors and their affiliates which could negatively impact rollins’ stock trading prices and affect the ability of minority stockholders to sell their shares future sales by executive officers directors and their affiliates of all or a portion of their shares could also negatively affect the trading price of our common stock 

provisions in rollins inc’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover of the company 

rollins inc’s certificate of incorporation bylaws and other documents contain provisions including advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and staggered terms for the board of directors these provisions may make a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors more difficult or expensive

critical accounting policies 

the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management’s most difficult complex or subjective judgments the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows 

accrual for termite contracts —the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications repairs and associated labor and chemicals settlements awards and other costs relative to termite control services factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company’s business practices however it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the company’s consolidated statements of financial position 

accrued insurance— the company retains up to specified limits certain risks related to general liability workers’ compensation and vehicle liability the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims the company contracts with an independent third party actuary on a semiannual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve along with management’s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances management’s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control additionally historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims initiatives that have been implemented include preemployment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers postoffer physicals for new employees prehire random and postaccident drug testing increased driver training and a postinjury nurse triage program for employees 

revenue recognition— the company’s revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services each of which are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities 

more on the company’s revenue recognition policy can be found in the company’s notes to the consolidated financial statements note 1 summary of significant accounting policies with the heading revenue recognition 

contingency accruals —the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 450 “contingencies” management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued however in the opinion of management the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the company’s consolidated statements of financial position 

  

defined benefit pension plans — in 2005 the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins inc defined benefit plan although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june 2005 the company also includes the waltham services llc hourly employee pension plan to the company’s financial statements waltham services llc hourly employees pension plan was amended effective september 1 2018 to freeze future benefit accruals for all participants the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the fasb asc topic 715 “compensation retirement benefits”  and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs with the assistance of the actuary the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets the discount rate and other factors and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 





the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes the investments strategy and the views of our investment adviser differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years therefore the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects future pension expense the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 70 which is unchanged from the prior year 

  

in regards to the rollins inc defined benefit plan the company utilizes a termination liability approach this approach reflects the estimated impact of the distribution of benefits due to a standard termination plan liabilities will be settled through the purchase of annuities from an insurance provider or through the distribution of lump sum payments to eligible participants that elect to receive such a form of payment discount rates of 390 per year for participants in pay status and 411 per year for participants with deferred benefits were selected by the plan sponsor to determine the benefit obligation resulting from plan termination annuity purchases the discount rates reflect the single effective interest rate that produces the same present value as that produced when the expected future cash flows for participants expected to elect an annuity are discounted with the ftse yield curve formerly citigroup as of the measurement date to determine the benefit obligation resulting from plan termination lump sum payments the expected future cash flows for lump sum eligible participants determined with the irc 417e mortality table for 2019 were discounted with the irc 417e segment interest rates for the month of november 2018 343 446 and 488 only 50 of active 30 of deferred vested and 25 of retired participants that will be eligible to receive a lump sum distribution of their pension benefit upon plan termination are assumed to elect this form of payment 

  

the discount rate of 400 as of december 31 2017 was updated as of december 31 2018 to 

 

  

waltham services llc hourly employees pension plan utilizes a yield curve approach the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the company’s expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds the discount rate was 405 as of december 31 2018 compared to 405 in 2017 and 435 in 2016 a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation 

  

as set forth in note 16 to the company’s financial statements included among the asset categories for the plan’s investments are real estate and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds these investments are categorized as investments at net asset value “nav” and are valued using significant nonobservable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value in accordance with accounting standards update “asu” no 200912 “ investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent” these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness  

  

as of december 31 2018 the defined benefit plans were fullyfunded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders’ equity by 148 million before tax and 110 million after tax

food quality protection act of 1996 “fqpa” 

the fqpa governs the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides and does not have a direct impact on how the company conducts its business

 item 1a risk factors 

our business depends on our strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands could hurt our ability to retain and expand our base of customers 

our strong brands rollins orkin hometeam pest defense western pest services northwest exterminating the industrial fumigant company crane pest control waltham services trutech permatreat critter control allpest safeguard pest control and other strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing our brands increases our ability to enter new markets and launch new and innovative services that better serve the needs of our customers our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including among others reputational issues and producttechnical failures further if our brands are significantly damaged our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a service leader and continue to provide highquality pest control products and services that are truly useful and play a meaningful role in people’s lives 

economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers as consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers including food service hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies for example we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider 

our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability 

our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force the demand for skilled employees is high and the supply is very limited a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force increases in wage rates paid by us or both if either of these events occurred our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired 

we may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitors’ prices and general economic issues we compete with other large pest control companies as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality and product availability terms of guarantees reputation for safety technical proficiency and price although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service are excellent we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain our competitive position 

our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation 

in the normal course of business some of the company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged the company does not believe that any pending claim proceeding or litigation either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position however it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters however unlikely could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual year 

our operations could be affected if there is unauthorized access of personal financial or other data or information about our customers employees third parties or of company’s proprietary of confidential information we could be subject to interruption of our business operations private litigation reputational damage and costly penalties 

our information technology systems as well as the information technology systems of our third party business partners and service providers can contain personal financial health or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees our information technology systems also contain company’s and its whollyowned subsidiaries’ proprietary and other confidential information related to our business such as business plans and product development initiatives we rely on among other things commercially available vendors cyber protection systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of this information and data the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card 

transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk meet standards set by the payment card industry “pci” we continue to evaluate and modify our systems and protocols for data security compliance purposes and such standards may change from time to time activities by third parties advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our systems any compromises breaches or errors in applications related to our systems or failures to comply with applicable standards could cause damage to our reputation and interruptions in our operations including our customers’ ability to pay for our services and products by credit card or their willingness to purchase our services and products and could result in a violation of applicable laws regulations orders industry standards or agreements and subject us to costs penalties and liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows also a breach of data security could expose us to customer litigation and costs related to the reporting and handling of such a breach 

our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws 

our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws we are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted we believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations we also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date however such environmental laws are changed frequently we are unable to predict whether environmental laws will in the future materially affect our operations and financial condition penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses fines and other corrective actions which would negatively affect our future financial results 

we may not be able to identify complete or successfully integrate acquisitions 

acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy we cannot assure investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future we cannot assure investors that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions 

our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions worldwide the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the company’s pest and termite control services the increase in pest presence and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods the business of the company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods 

our franchisees subcontractors and vendors could take actions that could harm our business 

our franchisees subcontractors and vendors are contractually obligated to operate their businesses in accordance with the standards set forth in our agreements with them each franchising brand also provides training and support to franchisees however franchisees subcontractors and vendors are independent third parties that we do not control and who own operate and oversee the daily operations of their businesses as a result the ultimate success of any franchise operation rests with the franchisee if franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required standards royalty payments to us will be adversely affected and our brands’ image and reputation could be harmed this could adversely impact our business financial position results of operations and cash flows similarly if subcontractors vendors and franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required laws standards and regulations we could be subject to claims from regulators or legal claims for the actions or omissions of such third‑party distributors subcontractors vendors and franchisees in addition our relationship with our franchisees subcontractors and vendors could become strained including resulting in litigation as we impose new standards or assert more rigorous enforcement practices of the existing required standards these strains in our relationships or claims could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time we receive communications from our franchisees regarding complaints disputes or questions about our practices and standards in relation to our franchised operations and certain economic terms of our franchise arrangements if franchisees or groups representing franchisees were to bring legal proceedings against us we would vigorously defend against the claims in any 

such proceeding our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted and the price of our common stock could decline 

our brand recognition could be impacted if we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business 

our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to service marks trademarks trade names and other intellectual property rights we own or license particularly our registered brand names and service marks orkin ®  orkin canada ®  acurid sm  western pest services ®  the industrial fumigant company hometeam pest defense ®  taexx ®  critter control ®  northwest exterminating ®  allpest ®  murray ®  safeguard ®  and others we have not sought to register or protect every one of our marks either in the united states or in every country in which they are or may be used furthermore because of the differences in foreign trademark patent and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws we may not receive the same protection in other countries as we would in the united states if we are unable to protect our proprietary information and brand names we could suffer a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information or to defend against claims by third parties that our products services or activities infringe their intellectual property rights 

the company’s management has a substantial ownership interest public stockholders may have no effective voice in the company’s management 

the company has elected the “controlled company” exemption under section 303a of the new york stock exchange “nyse” listed company manual the company is a “controlled company” because a group that includes the company’s chairman of the board r randall rollins and his brother gary w rollins who is the vice chairman and chief executive officer and a director of the company and certain companies under their control controls in excess of fifty percent of the company’s voting power as a “controlled company” the company need not comply with certain nyse rules 

rollins inc’s executive officers directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership in the aggregate approximately 56 percent of the company’s outstanding shares of common stock as a result these persons will effectively control the operations of the company including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company at a premium 

our management has a substantial ownership interest and the availability of the company’s common stock to the investing public may be limited 

the availability of rollins’ common stock to the investing public would be limited to those shares not held by the executive officers directors and their affiliates which could negatively impact rollins’ stock trading prices and affect the ability of minority stockholders to sell their shares future sales by executive officers directors and their affiliates of all or a portion of their shares could also negatively affect the trading price of our common stock 

provisions in rollins inc’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover of the company 

rollins inc’s certificate of incorporation bylaws and other documents contain provisions including advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and staggered terms for the board of directors these provisions may make a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors more difficult or expensive

general operating comments 

2017 marked the company’s 20th consecutive year of improved revenues and profits revenues for the year rose 64 percent to 1674 billion compared to 1573 billion for the prior year income before income taxes increased 130 to 2945 million compared to 2606 million the prior year net income increased 70 to 1791 million with earnings per diluted share of 082 compared to 1674 million or 077 per diluted share for the prior year 

the company’s 2017 net income was negatively affected by the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” which was signed in to law on december 22 2017 the estimated negative impact of the enactment of the tcja was an 116 million increase to tax expense which was a direct decrease to net income the 116 million increase in tax was as follows 80 million from transition tax on foreign earnings 29 million from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and 07 million from reductions in tax benefits on stock compensation this resulted in a 005 per diluted share decrease in net income for the year 

net income excluding the effect of the tcja increased 139 to 1907 million or 087 per share net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the effect of the tcja are nongaap financial measures management believes these measures help investors understand the effect of these on reported results 

all of the company’s business lines experienced growth for the year with residential pest control revenues up 64 commercial pest control revenues up 51 and termite and ancillary services revenues up 97 

during the year the company increased its presence around the world with the addition of 11 new orkin international franchises hometeam pest defense announced that they had reached one million taexx ®  installations we acquired northwest exterminating based in marietta ga which contributed in the growth of the companys revenues the last five months strategic acquisitions remain a priority for rollins the company also continued to improve our routing and scheduling capabilities as we utilize our customer service manager “csm” boss and its virtual route management feature boss has been fully implemented in the orkin’s us operations 

strategic acquisitions remain a priority for rollins and as in the past we will continue to seek out companies that are a “fit” for us in both the pest control and wildlife areas of our business

 critical accounting policies 

the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management’s most difficult complex or subjective judgments the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows 

accrual for termite contracts —the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications repairs and associated labor and chemicals settlements awards and other costs relative to termite control services factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company’s business practices however it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the company’s consolidated statements of financial position 

accrued insurance— the company retains up to specified limits certain risks related to general liability workers’ compensation and vehicle liability the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims the company contracts with an independent third party actuary on a semiannual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve along with management’s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances management’s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control additionally historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims initiatives that have been implemented include preemployment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers postoffer physicals for new employees prehire random and postaccident drug testing increased driver training and a postinjury nurse triage program for employees 

revenue recognition— the company’s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed for certain revenue types because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services certain accounting estimates are utilized residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly bimonthly or quarterly basis while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month in general pest control customers sign an initial oneyear contract and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed for pest control customers the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues 

termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element this portion is recognized as income on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits the allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straightline basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits 

revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term and the cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred for outstanding claims an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current factors and historical information the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts these costs are incurred over the contract term as the revenue is being deferred the future cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred the company accrues for noticed claims the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses 

all revenues are reported net of sales taxes 

contingency accruals —the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 450 “contingencies”  management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued however in the opinion of management the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the company’s consolidated statements of financial position 

defined benefit pension plans  — in 2005 the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins inc defined benefit plan although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june 2005 the company also includes the waltham services llc hourly employee pension plan to the company’s financial statements the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the fasb asc topic 715 “compensation retirement benefits”  and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs with the assistance of the actuary the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets the discount rate and other factors and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 

the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes the investments strategy and the views of our investment adviser differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years therefore the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects future pension expense the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 70 which is unchanged from the prior year 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company utilizes a yield curve approach the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the company’s expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds the discount rate was 40 as of december 31 2017 compared to 445 in 2016 and 47 in 2015 a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation 

as set forth in note 14 to the company’s financial statements included among the asset categories for the plan’s investments are real estate tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds these investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant nonobservable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value in accordance with accounting standards update “asu” no 200912 “ investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent”  these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness  

as of december 31 2017 the defined benefit plans were fullyfunded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders’ equity by 190 million before tax and 142 million after tax

seasonality 

the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the company’s pest and termite control services the increase in pest presence and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of the company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart

environmental and regulatory considerations

federal insecticide fungicide and rodentcide act “fifra” 

this federal law as amended grants to the states the responsibility to be the primary agent in enforcement and conditions under which pest control companies operate each state must meet certain guidelines of the environmental protection agency in regulating the following licensing record keeping contracts standards of application training and registration of products this allows each state to institute certain features that set their regulatory programs in keeping with special interests of the citizens’ wishes in each state the pest control industry is impacted by these federal and state regulations 

food quality protection act of 1996 “fqpa” 

the fqpa governs the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides and does not have a direct impact on how the company conducts its business

 item 1a risk factors 

we may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitors’ prices and general economic issues we compete with other large pest control companies as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality and product availability terms of guarantees reputation for safety technical proficiency and price although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service is excellent we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain our competitive position 

  

economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers as consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers including food service hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies for example we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider 

  



 

our business depends on our strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands could hurt our ability to retain and expand our base of customers 

our strong brands rollins orkin hometeam pest defense western pest services the industrial fumigant company crane pest control waltham services trutech perma treat critter control allpest and safeguard pest control have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing our brands increases our ability to enter new markets and launch new and innovative services that better serve the needs of our customers our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including among others reputational issues and producttechnical failures further if our brands are significantly damaged our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a service leader and continue to provide highquality pest control products and services that are truly useful and play a meaningful role in people’s lives 

we may not be able to identify complete or successfully integrate acquisitions 

acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy we cannot assure investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future we cannot assure investors that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions 

our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions worldwide the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the company’s pest and termite control services the increase in pest presence and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods the business of the company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods 

our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability 

our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force the demand for skilled employees is high and the supply is very limited a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force increases in wage rates paid by us or both if either of these events occurred our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired 

our operations could be affected if we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers employees and third parties we could be subject to interruption of our business operations private litigation reputational damage and costly penalties 

  

we rely on among other things commercially available vendors cyber protection systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential information of customers employees and third parties such as payment card and personal information the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk meeting standards set by the payment card industry “pci” we continue to evaluate and modify our systems and protocols for pci compliance purposes and such pci standards may change from time to time activities by third parties advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our systems any compromises breaches or errors in applications related to our systems or failures to comply with standards set by the pci could cause damage to our reputation and interruptions in our operations including our customers’ ability to pay for our services and products by credit card or their willingness to purchase our services and products and could result in a violation of applicable laws regulations orders industry standards or agreements and subject us to costs penalties and liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial position results of operations and cash flows also a breach of credit card data security could expose us to customer litigation 

  

our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation 

in the normal course of business some of the company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged the company does not believe that any pending claim proceeding or litigation either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position however it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters however unlikely could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual year  

our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws 

our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws we are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted we believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations we also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date however such environmental laws are changed frequently we are unable to predict whether environmental laws will in the future materially affect our operations and financial condition penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses fines and other corrective actions which would negatively affect our future financial results 



 

the company’s management has a substantial ownership interest public stockholders may have no effective voice in the company’s management 

the company has elected the “controlled company” exemption under section 303a of the new york stock exchange “nyse” listed company manual the company is a “controlled company” because a group that includes the company’s chairman of the board r randall rollins and his brother gary w rollins who is the vice chairman and chief executive officer and a director of the company and certain companies under their control controls in excess of fifty percent of the company’s voting power as a “controlled company” the company need not comply with certain nyse rules 

rollins inc’s executive officers directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership in the aggregate approximately 57 percent of the company’s outstanding shares of common stock as a result these persons will effectively control the operations of the company including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company at a premium 

our management has a substantial ownership interest and the availability of the company’s common stock to the investing public may be limited 

the availability of rollins’ common stock to the investing public would be limited to those shares not held by the executive officers directors and their affiliates which could negatively impact rollins’ stock trading prices and affect the ability of minority stockholders to sell their shares future sales by executive officers directors and their affiliates of all or a portion of their shares could also negatively affect the trading price of our common stock 

provisions in rollins inc’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover of the company 

rollins inc’s certificate of incorporation bylaws and other documents contain provisions including advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and staggered terms for the board of directors these provisions may make a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors more difficult or expensive

critical accounting policies 

the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management’s most difficult complex or subjective judgments the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows 

accrual for termite contracts —the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications repairs and associated labor and chemicals settlements awards and other costs relative to termite control services factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company’s business practices however it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the company’s consolidated statements of financial position 

accrued insurance— the company selfinsures up to specified limits certain risks related to general liability workers’ compensation and vehicle liability the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the selfinsurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims the company contracts an independent third party actuary on a semiannual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve along with management’s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances management’s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control additionally historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims initiatives that have been implemented include preemployment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers postoffer physicals for new employees prehire random and postaccident drug testing increased driver training and a postinjury nurse triage program for employees 

revenue recognition— the company’s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed for certain revenue types because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services certain accounting estimates are utilized residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly bimonthly or quarterly basis while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month in general pest control customers sign an initial oneyear contract and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed for pest control customers the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues 

termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element this portion is recognized as income on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits the allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straightline basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits 

  

revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term and the cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred for outstanding claims an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current factors and historical information the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts these costs are incurred over the contract term as the revenue is being deferred the future cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred the company accrues for noticed claims the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses 

all revenues are reported net of sales taxes 

contingency accruals —the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 450 “contingencies” management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued however in the opinion of management the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the company’s consolidated statements of financial position 

  



 

defined benefit pension plans — in 2005 the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins inc defined benefit plan although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june 2005 the company also includes the waltham services llc hourly employee pension plan to the company’s financial statements the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the fasb asc topic 715 “compensation retirement benefits”  and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs with the assistance of the actuary the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets the discount rate and other factors and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 

  

the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes the investments strategy and the views of our investment adviser differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years therefore the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects future pension expense the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 70 which is unchanged from the prior year 

  

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company utilizes a yield curve approach the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the company’s expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds the discount rate was 445 as of december 31 2016 compared to 47 in 2015 and 415 in 2014 a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation 

  

as set forth in note 14 to the company’s financial statements included among the asset categories for the plan’s investments are real estate tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds these investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant nonobservable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value in accordance with accounting standards update “asu” no 200912 “ investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent” these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness  

  

as of december 31 2016 the defined benefit plans were underfunded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders’ equity by 30 million before tax and 17 million after tax

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

seasonality

the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the company’s pest and termite control services the increase in pest presence and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of the company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart

 item 1a risk factors

 

we may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitors’ prices and general economic issues we compete with other large pest control companies as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality and product availability terms of guarantees reputation for safety technical proficiency and price although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service is excellent we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain our competitive position

  

economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

 

pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers as consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers including food service hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies for example we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider

 

we may not be able to identify complete or successfully integrate acquisitions 

 

acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy we cannot assure investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future we cannot assure investors that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 

our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions 

 

our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions across the united states canada and australia the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the company’s pest and termite control services the increase in pest presence and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods the business of the company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods

 

our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability 

 

our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force the demand for skilled employees is high and the supply is very limited a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force increases in wage rates paid by us or both if either of these events occurred our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired

 

our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation 

 

in the normal course of business some of the company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged the company does not believe that any pending claim proceeding or litigation either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position however it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters however unlikely could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual year  

  

our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws 

 

our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws we are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted we believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations we also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date however such environmental laws are changed frequently we are unable to predict whether environmental laws will in the future materially affect our operations and financial condition penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses fines and other corrective actions which would negatively affect our future financial results

 



 

the company’s management has a substantial ownership interest public stockholders may have no effective voice in the company’s management 

 

the company has elected the “controlled company” exemption under section 303a of the new york stock exchange “nyse” listed company manual the company is a “controlled company” because a group that includes the company’s chairman of the board r randall rollins and his brother gary w rollins who is the vice chairman and chief executive officer and a director of the company and certain companies under their control controls in excess of fifty percent of the company’s voting power as a “controlled company” the company need not comply with certain nyse rules

 

rollins inc’s executive officers directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership in the aggregate approximately 56 percent of the company’s outstanding shares of common stock as a result these persons will effectively control the operations of the company including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company at a premium

on december 2 2014 plaintiff killian pest control sued rollins inc its subsidiary hometeam pest defense and alleged that hometeam’s exclusive use of its “tubes in the walls” system violates the federal sherman antitrust act and california’s cartwright act and business and professions code plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the alleged misconduct violates the sherman and cartwright acts and the business and professions code a permanent injunction against continuing alleged violations and monetary damages the lawsuit is pending in the united states district court northern district of california the company cannot currently estimate the loss if any because the lawsuit is at an early stage and involves unresolved issues of law and fact the company intends to defend this matter vigorously

critical accounting policies

 

the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management’s most difficult complex or subjective judgments the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows

 

accrual for termite contracts —the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications repairs and associated labor and chemicals settlements awards and other costs relative to termite control services factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company’s business practices however it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the company’s consolidated statements of financial position

 

accrued insurance— the company selfinsures up to specified limits certain risks related to general liability workers’ compensation and vehicle liability the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the selfinsurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims the company contracts an independent third party actuary on a semiannual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve along with management’s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances management’s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control additionally historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims initiatives that have been implemented include preemployment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers postoffer physicals for new employees prehire random and postaccident drug testing increased driver training and a nurse triage program for employees

 

revenue recognition— the company’s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed for certain revenue types because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services certain accounting estimates are utilized residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly bimonthly or quarterly basis while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month in general pest control customers sign an initial oneyear contract and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed for pest control customers the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues

 

termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element this portion is recognized as income on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits the allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straightline basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits

 

revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term and the cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred for outstanding claims an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current factors and historical information the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts these costs are incurred over the contract term as the revenue is being deferred the future cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred the company accrues for noticed claims the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses

 

all revenues are reported net of sales taxes

 

contingency accruals —the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 450 “contingencies” management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued however in the opinion of management the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the company’s consolidated statements of financial position

 



 

defined benefit pension plans — in 2005 the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins inc defined benefit plan although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june 2005 the company also includes the waltham services llc hourly employee pension plan to the company’s financial statements the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the fasb asc topic 715 “compensation retirement benefits”  and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs with the assistance of the actuary the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets the discount rate and other factors and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary

 

the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes the investments strategy and the views of our investment adviser differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years therefore the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects future pension expense the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 70 which is unchanged from the prior year

 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company utilizes a yield curve approach the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the company’s expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds the discount rate was 47 as of december 31 2015 compared to 415 in 2014 and 52 in 2013 a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation

 

as set forth in note 13 to the company’s financial statements included among the asset categories for the plan’s investments are real estate tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds these investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant nonobservable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value in accordance with accounting standards update “asu” no 200912 “ investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent” these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness  

 

as of december 31 2015 the defined benefit plans were underfunded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders’ equity by 148 million before tax and 91 million after tax

seasonality

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

we may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future 

  

we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitors’ prices and general economic issues we compete with other large pest control companies as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality and product availability terms of guarantees reputation for safety technical proficiency and price although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service is excellent we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain our competitive position 

  

economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

  

pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers as consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers including food service hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies for example we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider 

  

we may not be able to identify complete or successfully integrate acquisitions 

  

acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy we cannot assure investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future we cannot assure investors that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions 

  

our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions across the united states and canada the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the company’s pest and termite control services the increase in pest presence and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods the business of the company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods 

  

our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability 

  

our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force the demand for skilled employees is high and the supply is very limited a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force increases in wage rates paid by us or both if either of these events occurred our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired 

  

our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation 

  

in the normal course of business some of the company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged the company does not believe that any pending claim proceeding or litigation either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position however it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters however unlikely could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual year  

  

our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws 

  

our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws we are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted we believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations we also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date however such environmental laws are changed frequently we are unable to predict whether environmental laws will in the future materially affect our operations and financial condition penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses fines and other corrective actions which would negatively affect our future financial results 





the company’s management has a substantial ownership interest public stockholders may have no effective voice in the company’s management 

  

the company has elected the “controlled company” exemption under section 303a of the new york stock exchange “nyse” listed company manual the company is a “controlled company” because a group that includes the company’s chairman of the board r randall rollins and his brother gary w rollins who is the vice chairman and chief executive officer and a director of the company and certain companies under their control controls in excess of fifty percent of the company’s voting power as a “controlled company” the company need not comply with certain nyse rules 

  

rollins inc’s executive officers directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership in the aggregate approximately 57 percent of the company’s outstanding shares of common stock as a result these persons will effectively control the operations of the company including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company at a premium

critical accounting policies 

  

the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management’s most difficult complex or subjective judgments the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows 

  

accrual for termite contracts — the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications repairs and associated labor and chemicals settlements awards and other costs relative to termite control services factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company’s business practices however it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the company’s consolidated statements of financial position 

  

accrued insurance — the company selfinsures up to specified limits certain risks related to general liability workers’ compensation and vehicle liability the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the selfinsurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims the company contracts an independent third party actuary on a semiannual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve along with management’s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances management’s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control additionally historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims initiatives that have been implemented include preemployment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers postoffer physicals for new employees and prehire random and postaccident drug testing the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a “red alert” program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limitedduty basis 





revenue recognition — the company’s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed for certain revenue types because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services certain accounting estimates are utilized residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly bimonthly or quarterly basis while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month in general pest control customers sign an initial oneyear contract and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed for pest control customers the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues 

  

termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element this portion is recognized as income on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits the allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straightline basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits 

  

revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term and the cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred for outstanding claims an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current factors and historical information the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts these costs are incurred over the contract term as the revenue is being deferred the future cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred the company accrues for noticed claims the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses

  

all revenues are reported net of sales taxes 

  

contingency accruals — the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 450 “contingencies” management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued however in the opinion of management the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the company’s consolidated statements of financial position 

  

defined benefit pension plans — in 2005 the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins inc defined benefit plan although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june 2005 the company terminated the waltham services llc salaried pension plan and all benefits have been settled via an annuity purchase or lump sum distribution in december 2012 the company also includes the waltham services llc hourly employee pension plan to the company’s financial statements the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the fasb asc topic 715 “compensation retirement benefits”  and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs with the assistance of the actuary the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets the discount rate and other factors and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 

  

the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes the investments strategy and the views of our investment adviser differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years therefore the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects future pension expense the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 70 which is unchanged from the prior year 

  

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company utilizes a yield curve approach the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the company’s expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds the discount rate was 415 as of december 31 2014 compared to 520 in 2013 and 417 in 2012 a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation 





as set forth in note 13 to the company’s financial statements included among the asset categories for the plan’s investments are real estate tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds these investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant nonobservable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value in accordance with accounting standards update “asu” no 200912 “ investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent” these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness 

  

as of december 31 2014 the defined benefit plans were underfunded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income decreased stockholders’ equity by 417 million before tax and 256 million after tax

seasonality

 

the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the company’s pest and termite control services the increase in pest presence and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of the company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart

 item 1a risk factors

 

we may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitors’ prices and general economic issues we compete with other large pest control companies as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality and product availability terms of guarantees reputation for safety technical proficiency and price although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service is excellent we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain our competitive position

  

economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

  

pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to most of our residential customers as consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers including food service hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies for example we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider

 

we may not be able to identify complete or successfully integrate acquisitions 

  

acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy we cannot assure investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future we cannot assure investors that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 

our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions 

  

our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions across the united states and canada the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the company’s pest and termite control services the increase in pest presence and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the company’s pest and termite control operations during such periods the business of the company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods

 

our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability 

 

our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force the demand for skilled employees is high and the supply is very limited a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force increases in wage rates paid by us or both if either of these events occurred our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired

 

our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation 

  

in the normal course of business some of the company’s subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged the company does not believe that any pending claim proceeding or litigation either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position however it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters however unlikely could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual year

  





our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws 

 

our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws we are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted we believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations we also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date however such environmental laws are changed frequently we are unable to predict whether environmental laws will in the future materially affect our operations and financial condition penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses fines and other corrective actions which would negatively affect our future financial results

 

the company’s management has a substantial ownership interest public stockholders may have no effective voice in the company’s management 

  

the company has elected the “controlled company” exemption under section 303a of the new york stock exchange “nyse” listed company manual the company is a “controlled company” because a group that includes the company’s chairman of the board r randall rollins and his brother gary w rollins who is the vice chairman and chief executive officer and a director of the company and certain companies under their control controls in excess of fifty percent of the company’s voting power as a “controlled company” the company need not comply with certain nyse rules

 

rollins inc’s executive officers directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership in the aggregate approximately 57 percent of the company’s outstanding shares of common stock as a result these persons will effectively control the operations of the company including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company at a premium

 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

 

none 

 




 item 2 properties

 

the company’s administrative headquarters are owned by the company and are located at 2170 piedmont road ne atlanta georgia 30324 the company owns or leases over 500 branch offices and operating facilities used in its business as well as the rollins training center located in atlanta georgia the rollins customer service center located in covington georgia and the pacific division administration and training center in riverside california none of the branch offices individually considered represents a materially important physical property of the company the facilities are suitable and adequate to meet the current and reasonably anticipated future needs of the company

critical accounting policies

 

the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management’s most difficult complex or subjective judgments the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows

 

accrual for termite contracts —the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications repairs and associated labor and chemicals settlements awards and other costs relative to termite control services factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company’s business practices however it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the company’s consolidated statements of financial position

 

accrued insurance —the company selfinsures up to specified limits certain risks related to general liability workers’ compensation and vehicle liability the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the selfinsurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims the company contracts an independent third party actuary on a semiannual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve along with management’s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances management’s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management’s knowledge and control additionally historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims initiatives that have been implemented include preemployment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers postoffer physicals for new employees and prehire random and postaccident drug testing the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a “red alert” program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limitedduty basis

 

revenue recognition —the company’s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed for certain revenue types because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services certain accounting estimates are utilized residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly bimonthly or quarterly basis while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month in general pest control customers sign an initial oneyear contract and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed for pest control customers the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues

 

termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element this portion is recognized as income on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits the allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straightline basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits

 

at inception revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term and the cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred for outstanding claims an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current factors and historical information the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts these costs are incurred over the contract term as the revenue is being deferred the future cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred the company accrues for noticed claims the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses

 





all revenues are reported net of sales taxes

 

contingency accruals —the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business in accordance with fasb asc topic 450 “contingencies” management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued however in the opinion of management the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the company’s consolidated statements of financial position

 

defined benefit pension plans — in 2005 the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins inc defined benefit plan although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june 2005 the company terminated the waltham services llc salaried pension plan and all benefits have been settled via an annuity purchase or lump sum in december 2012 the company also includes the waltham services llc hourly employee pension plan to the company’s financial statements the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with fasb asc topic 715 “compensation retirement benefits”  and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs with the assistance of the actuary the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets the discount rate and other factors and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary

 

the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes the investments strategy and the views of our investment adviser differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years therefore the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense the company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7 which is unchanged from the prior year

 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company utilizes a yield curve approach the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the company’s expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecasted and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds the discount rate was 520 as of december 31 2013 compared to 417 in 2012 and 501 in 2011 a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation

 

as set forth in note 13 to the company’s financial statements included among the asset categories for the plan’s investments are real estate tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds these investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant nonobservable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value in accordance with asu no 200912 “ investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent” these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds’ judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds’ financial statements for reasonableness  

 

as of december 31 2013 the defined benefit plans were overfunded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders’ equity by 457 million before tax and 281 million after tax

seasonality 

the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the companys pest and termite control services the increase in pest pressure and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of the companys pest and termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart

environmental and regulatory considerations 

the companys pest control business is subject to various legislative and regulatory enactments that are designed to protect the environment public health and consumers compliance with these requirements has not had a material negative impact on the companys financial position results of operations or liquidity 

federal insecticide fungicide and rodentcide act fifra

food quality protection act of 1996 fqpa 

the fqpa governs the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides and does not have a direct impact on how the company conducts its business

 item 1a risk factors 

we may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the competitive pest control industry in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitive prices and general economic issues we compete with other large pest control companies as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality and product and availability terms of guarantees reputation for safety technical proficiency and price although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service is excellent we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our competitive position 

economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to most of our residential customers as consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers including food service hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies for example we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider 

we may not be able to identify complete or successfully integrate acquisitions 

acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy we cannot assure that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future we cannot assure that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions 

our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions across the united states and canada the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the companys pest and termite control services the increase in pest pressure and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the companys pest and termite control operations during such periods the business of the company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods 

our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability 

our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force the demand for skilled employees is high and the supply is very limited a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force increases in wage rates paid by us or both if either of these events occurred our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired 

our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation 

in the normal course of business some of the companys subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged the company does not believe that any pending claim proceeding or litigation either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position however it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters however unlikely could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual year 

our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws 

our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws we are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted we believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations we also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date however such environmental laws are changed frequently we are unable to predict whether environmental laws will in the future materially affect our operations and financial condition penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses fines and other corrective actions which would negatively affect our future financial results 

the companys management has a substantial ownership interest public stockholders may have no effective voice in the companys management 

the company has elected the controlled company exemption under rule 303a of the new york stock exchange nyse company guide the company is a controlled company because a group that includes the companys chairman of the board r randall rollins and his brother gary w rollins who is the vice chairman and chief executive officer also a director of the company and certain companies under their control controls in excess of fifty percent of the companys voting power as a controlled company the company need not comply with certain nyse rules 

rollins incs executive officers directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership in the aggregate approximately 57 percent of the companys outstanding shares of common stock as a result these persons will effectively control the operations of the company including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company at a premium

critical accounting policies 

the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult complex or subjective judgments the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows 

accrual for termite contracts —the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications repairs and associated labor and chemicals settlements awards and other costs relative to termite control services factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the companys business practices however it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the companys consolidated statements of financial position 

accrued insurance —the company selfinsures up to specified limits certain risks related to general liability workers compensation and vehicle liability the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the selfinsurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims the company contracts an independent third party actuary on a semiannual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information the actuarial study is a major consideration along with managements knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances the reserve is established based on all these factors managements judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside managements knowledge and control additionally historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims initiatives that have been implemented include preemployment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers postoffer physicals for new employees and prehire random and postaccident drug testing the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a red alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limitedduty basis 

revenue recognition —the companys revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed for certain revenue types because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services certain accounting estimates are utilized residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly bimonthly or quarterly basis while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month in general pest control customers sign an initial oneyear contract and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed for pest control customers the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues 

termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element this portion is recognized as income on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits the allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting 

other specified performance conditions baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straightline basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits 

at inception revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term and the cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred for outstanding claims an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current factors and historical information the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts these costs are incurred over the contract term as the revenue is being deferred the future cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred the company accrues for noticed claims the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses 

all revenues are reported net of sales taxes 

contingency accruals —the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business in accordance with fasb asc topic 450 contingencies management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued however in the opinion of management the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the companys consolidated statements of financial position 

defined benefit pension plans —in 2005 the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins inc defined benefit plan although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june 2005 the company terminated the waltham services llc salaried pension plan and all benefits have been settled via an annuity purchase or lump sum in december 2012 the company also includes the waltham services llc hourly employee pension plan to the companys financial statements the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with fasb asc topic 715 compensationretirement benefits  and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs with the assistance of the actuary the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets the discount rate and other factors and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 

the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes the investments strategy and the views of our investment adviser differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years therefore the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense the companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7 which is unchanged from the prior year 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company utilizes a yield curve approach the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the companys expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecasted and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds the discount rate was 417 as of december 31 2012 compared to 501 in 2011 and 551 in 2010 a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation 

as set forth in note 13 to the companys financial statements included among the asset categories for the plans investments are real estate tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds these investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant nonobservable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value in accordance with asu no 200912  investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds financial statements for reasonableness 

as of december 31 2012 the defined benefit plans were underfunded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income decreased stockholders equity by 154 million before tax and 95 million after tax 

new accounting standards 

recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2013 

in december 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 201111 to topic 210 balance sheet the update requires new disclosures about balance sheet offsetting and related arrangements for derivatives and financial assets and liabilities the amendments require disclosure of gross asset and liability amounts amounts offset on the balance sheet and amounts subject to the offsetting requirements but not offset on the balance sheet the guidance is effective december 1 2013 and is to be applied retrospectively this guidance does not amend the existing guidance on when it is appropriate to offset as a result we do not expect this guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements 

in july 2012 the fasb issued asu no 201202 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment asu 201202 this standard provides new accounting guidance that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test an entity would continue to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset if the asset fails the qualitative assessment while no further analysis would be required if it passes the provisions of the new guidance are effective as of the beginning of our 2013 fiscal year we do not expect the new guidance to have an impact on the 2013 impairment test results 

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 201302 to topic 220 comprehensive income the guidance which requires disclosure of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on the respective line items of net income this guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of 2013 we do not expect the new guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements

seasonality 

the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the companys pest and termite control services the increase in pest pressure and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of the companys pest and termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart

environmental and regulatory considerations 

the companys pest control business is subject to various legislative and regulatory enactments that are designed to protect the environment public health and consumers compliance with these requirements has not had a material negative impact on the companys financial position results of operations or liquidity 

federal insecticide fungicide and rodentcide act fifra 

this federal law as amended grants to the states the responsibility to be the primary agent in enforcement and conditions under which pest control companies operate each state must meet certain guidelines of the environmental protection agency in regulating the following licensing record keeping contracts standards of application training and registration of products this allows each state to institute certain features that set their regulatory programs in keeping with special interests of the citizens wishes in each state the pest control industry is impacted by these federal and state regulations 

food quality protection act of 1996 fqpa 

the fqpa governs the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides and does not have a direct impact on how the company conducts its business 

environmental remediation 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as superfund is the primary federal statute regulating the cleanup of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties responsibilities governed by this statute include the management of hazardous substances reporting releases of hazardous substances and establishing the necessary contracts and agreements to conduct cleanup customarily the parties involved will work with the epa and under the direction of the responsible state agency to agree and implement a plan for site remediation consistent with the companys responsibilities under these regulations the company undertakes environmental assessments and remediation of hazardous substances from time to time as the company determines its responsibilities for these purposes as these situations arise the company accrues managements best estimate of future costs for these activities based on managements current estimates of these costs management does not believe these costs are material to the companys financial condition or operating results

 item 1a risk factors 

we may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the competitive pest control industry in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitive prices and general economic issues we compete with other large pest control companies as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality and product and availability terms of guarantees reputation for safety technical proficiency and price although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service is excellent we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our competitive position 

economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to most of our residential customers as consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers including food service hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies for example we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider 

we may not be able to identify complete or successfully integrate acquisitions 

acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy we cannot assure that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future we cannot assure that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions 

our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions across the united states and canada the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the companys pest and termite control services the increase in pest pressure and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the companys pest and termite control operations during such periods the business of the company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods 

our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability 

our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force the demand for skilled employees is high and the supply is very limited a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force increases in wage rates paid by us or both if either of these events occurred our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired 

our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation 

in the normal course of business some of the companys subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged the company does not believe that any pending claim proceeding or litigation either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position however it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters however unlikely could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual year 

our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws 

our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws we are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted we believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations we also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date however such environmental laws are changed frequently we are unable to predict whether environmental laws will in the future materially affect our operations and financial condition penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses fines and other corrective actions which would negatively affect our future financial results 

the companys management has a substantial ownership interest public stockholders may have no effective voice in the companys management 

the company has elected the controlled company exemption under rule 303a of the new york stock exchange nyse company guide the company is a controlled company because a group that includes the companys chairman of the board r randall rollins and his brother gary w rollins who is the president chief executive officer and chief operating officer also a director of the company and certain companies under their control controls in excess of fifty percent of the companys voting power as a controlled company the company need not comply with certain nyse rules 

rollins incs executive officers directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership in the aggregate approximately 57 percent of the companys outstanding shares of common stock as a result these persons will effectively control the operations of the company including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company at a premium

litigation 

for discussion on the companys legal contingencies see note 12 to the accompanying financial statements 

off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments 

other than the operating leases disclosed in the table that follows the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that the companys contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows 



1 these amounts represent expected payments with interest for unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2011 uncertain tax positions of 07 million are not included due to the uncertainty of the final amount and settlement 2 minimum pension funding requirements are not included as funding will not be required the company is considering making contributions to its pension plans of approximately 50 million during 2012 critical accounting policies 

the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult complex or subjective judgments the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows 

accrual for termite contracts —the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications repairs and associated labor and chemicals settlements awards and other costs relative to termite control services factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the companys business practices however it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims accrual for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the companys consolidated statements of financial position 

accrued insurance —the company selfinsures up to specified limits certain risks related to general liability workers compensation and vehicle liability the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the selfinsurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims the company contracts an independent third party actuary on a semiannual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information the actuarial study is a major consideration along with managements knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances the reserve is established based on all these factors managements judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside managements knowledge and control additionally historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims initiatives that have been implemented include preemployment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required 

on all its drivers postoffer physicals for new employees and prehire random and postaccident drug testing the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a red alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limitedduty basis 

revenue recognition —the companys revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed for certain revenue types because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services certain accounting estimates are utilized residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly bimonthly or quarterly basis while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month in general pest control customers sign an initial oneyear contract and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed for pest control customers the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring services a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element this portion is recognized as income on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits the allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straightline basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits 

revenue received for termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term and the cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred for outstanding claims an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current factors and historical information the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts these costs are incurred over the contract term as the revenue is being deferred the future cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred the company accrues for noticed claims the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses 

all revenues are reported net of sales taxes 

contingency accruals —the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business in accordance with fasb asc topic 450 contingencies the company estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued however in the opinion of management the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and longterm accrued liabilities on the companys consolidated statements of financial position 

defined benefit pension plans —in 2002 the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins inc defined benefit plan although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through march 2002 the company has other smaller pension plans related to acquisitions included in note 13 to the companys financial statements the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in 

accordance with fasb asc topic 715 compensationretirement benefits and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs with the assistance of the actuary the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets the discount rate and other factors and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 

the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes the investments strategy and the views of our investment adviser differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years therefore the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense the companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7 which is unchanged from the prior year 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company utilizes a yield curve approach the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the companys expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecasted and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds the discount rate was 501 as of december 31 2011 compared to 551 in 2010 and 601 in 2009 a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation 

as set forth in note 13 to the companys financial statements included among the asset categories for the plans investments are real estate tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds these investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant nonobservable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value in accordance with asu no 200912  investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent  these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds financial statements for reasonableness 

as of december 31 2011 the defined benefit plans were underfunded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders equity by 244 million before tax and 149 million after tax 

new accounting standards

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201108 which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current twostep test for goodwill impairment if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required the revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 however an entity can choose to early adopt even if its annual test date is before the issuance of the final standard provided that the entity has not yet performed its 2011 annual impairment test or issued its financial statements the adoption of this asu is not expected to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 201111 to topic 210 balance sheet the update requires new disclosures about balance sheet offsetting and related arrangements for derivatives and financial assets and liabilities the amendments require disclosure of gross asset and liability amounts amounts offset on the balance sheet and amounts subject to the offsetting requirements but not offset on the balance sheet the guidance is effective december 1 2013 and is to be applied retrospectively this guidance does not amend the existing guidance on when it is appropriate to offset as a result we do not expect this guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 201105 presentation of comprehensive income asu 201105 this standard eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity under this standard an entity can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement—referred to as the statement of comprehensive income—or in two separate but consecutive statements in december 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201112 deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 201105 asu 201112 asu 201112 defers the effective date of the requirement in asu 201105 to disclose on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income all other requirements of asu 201105 are not affected by asu 201112 the company adopted asu 201105 effective december 31 2011 and deferred certain disclosures as allowed under asu 201112 asu 201105 did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows the expiration of deferral allowed by asu 201112 is not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements

 item 1a risk factors 

we may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the competitive pest control industry in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitive prices and general economic issues we compete with other large pest control companies as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality and product and availability terms of guarantees reputation for safety technical proficiency and price although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service is excellent we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our competitive position 

economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to most of our residential customers as consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers including food service hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies for example we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider 

we may not be able to identify complete or successfully integrate acquisitions 

acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy we cannot assure that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to 

us in the future we cannot assure that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions 

our operations are directly affected by the weather conditions across the united states and canada the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the companys pest and termite control services the increase in pest pressure and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the companys pest and termite control operations during such periods the business of the company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods 

our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability 

our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force the demand for skilled employees is high and the supply is very limited a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force increases in our wage rates paid by us or both if either of these events occurred our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired 

our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation 

in the normal course of business some of the companys subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged the company does not believe that any pending claim proceeding or litigation either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position however it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters however unlikely could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual year 

our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws 

our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws we are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted we believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations we also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date however such environmental laws are changed frequently we are unable to predict whether environmental laws will in the future materially affect our operations and financial condition penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses fines and other corrective actions which would negatively affect our future financial results 

the companys management has a substantial ownership interest public stockholders may have no effective voice in the companys management 

the company has elected the controlled company exemption under rule 303a of the new york stock exchange nyse company guide the company is a controlled company because a group that includes the companys chairman of the board r randall rollins and his brother gary w rollins who is the president chief executive officer and chief operating officer also a director of the company and certain companies under their control controls in excess of fifty percent of the companys voting power as a controlled company the company need not comply with certain nyse rules 

rollins incs executive officers directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership in the aggregate approximately 57 percent of the companys outstanding shares of common stock as a result these persons will effectively control the operations of the company including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company at a premium

approximately 190 of the companys revenue grew 35 in 2010 due to increases in ancillary services sales as well as the companys expanded sales force 

the companys foreign operations accounted for approximately 8 and 7 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the company established new franchises in jamaica ireland and turkey for a total of sixteen international franchises at december 31 2010 orkin had 72 and 65 total domestic and international franchises at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively

depreciation and amortization 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2010 depreciation and amortization decreased 08 million or 20 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2009 the decrease is due to amortization of intangible assets acquired related to several older acquisitions by orkin becoming fully amortized partially offset by additional intangible asset amortization associated with the acquisition of waltham services and other smaller acquisitions 

sales general and administrative 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2010 sales general and administrative expenses increased 177 million or 50 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2009 representing 328 of revenues compared to 331 of revenues in the prior year the increase in total dollars primarily reflects higher personnel related cost due to higher health insurance expense employment taxes sales cost and consulting work while advertising and promotion costs declined overall costs rose at a lesser rate than revenue reducing the costs as a percent of revenue 

interest expense net 

interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2010 was a 04 million a decrease of 05 million compared to 10 million in 2009 due to average debt outstanding over the full year being less than the prior year and an increase in cash on hand

gainloss on salesimpairment of assets before interest improved to 01 million loss for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 29 million loss in 2009 due to an impairment of assets charge of 29 million attributed to a write down of the companys routing and scheduling initiative in 2009 

taxes 

the companys effective tax rate was 373 in 2010 compared to 335 in 2009 the reduced rate in 2009 was due to a tax benefit from converting several of rollins incs whollyowned subsidiaries from c corporations to limited liability companies partially offset by taxes on repatriation of canadian cash to the united states from orkin incs whollyowned subsidiary pco services 

results of operations—2009 versus 2008 

overview 

for the year ended december 31 2009 the company had net income of 840 million compared to 689 million in 2008 a 218 increase the company achieved a 52 increase in revenue with all business lines contributing to the growth again our ability to grow during very challenging economic conditions confirms our belief that the company is recession resistant additionally the company was effective in controlling cost as gross margin improved 11 percentage points to 487 for 2009 versus 476 for 2008 sales general and administrative expense also showed a small improvement 2009 was 331 of revenue versus 332 in 2008 while there was a small deterioration in depreciation margin 35 in 2009 versus 33 in 2008 it is a result of our investments in acquisitions most notably hometeam and crane 

during 2009 we were able to direct our business so that the weak economy did not have a serious impact the companys business model provides for strength from recurring revenues and a diverse customer base in 2009 our largest twenty customers were less than 35 of our total revenues the 2009 revenue growth was due to an expanded sales force an emphasis on customer retention and acquisitions this coupled with strong cost management and tax strategies led to the 218 increase in net income in 2009 

revenues 

revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 were 11 billion an increase of 534 million or 52 from 2008 revenues of 10 billion commercial pest control represented 410 of the companys business in 2009 commercial pest control revenues grew 54 in 2009 due primarily to an expanded sales force the companys emphasis on customer retention the addition of crane pest control and strong domestic growth at pco services orkins canadian business residential pest control represented approximately 390 of the companys business residential pest control revenues increased 50 in 2009 due to the acquisition of hometeam pest defense the expanded sales force and the companys pricing initiative the companys termite business which represented approximately 190 of the companys revenue grew 60 in 2009 due to the acquisition of hometeam pest defense as well as the companys expanded sales force

depreciation and amortization 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 depreciation and amortization increased 37 million an increase of 111 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2008 the increase is due to 37 million in depreciation and amortization related to the acquisition of hometeam on april 3 2008 and the crane pest control acquisition of december 31 2008

interest incomeexpense net

critical accounting policies 

the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult complex or subjective judgments the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows 

subsequent events —the company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued as of the filing date february 25 2011 there were no subsequent events that would affect its financial statements 

accrual for termite contracts —the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications repairs and associated labor and chemicals settlements awards and other costs relative to termite control services factors that may impact future cost include chemical life expectancy and government regulation it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the companys business practices however it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims positive changes to our business practices include revisions made to our contracts more effective treatment methods more effective termiticides and expanding training 

accrued insurance —the company selfinsures up to specified limits certain risks related to general liability workers compensation and vehicle liability the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the selfinsurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims the company contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information the actuarial study is a major consideration along with managements 

knowledge of changes in business practices and existing claims compared to current balances the reserve is established based on all these factors due to the uncertainty associated with the estimation of future loss and expense payments and inherent limitations of the data actual developments may vary from the companys projections this is particularly true since critical assumptions regarding the parameters used to develop reserve estimates are largely based upon judgment therefore changes in estimates may be material managements judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside managements knowledge and control additionally historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims initiatives that have been implemented include preemployment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers postoffer physicals for new employees and prehire random and postaccident drug testing the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a red alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limitedduty basis 

revenue recognition —the companys revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed for certain revenue types because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services certain accounting estimates are utilized residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly bimonthly or quarterly basis while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month in general pest control customers sign an initial oneyear contract and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed for pest control customers the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation the company recognizes revenue for the delivery of the monitoring stations initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and installation of the monitoring services the amount deferred is the fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service fair values are generally established based on the prices charged when sold separately by the company the amount deferred for the undelivered monitoring element is then recognized as income on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straightline basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits 

revenue received for termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term and the cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred for outstanding claims an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current factors and historical information the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts these costs are incurred over the contract term as the revenue is being deferred the future cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred the company accrues for noticed claims the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses 

contingency accruals —the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codificationtm asc topic 450  contingencies  the company estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation 

judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued however in the opinion of management the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations 

defined benefit pension plans —in 2002 the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins inc defined benefit plan although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through march 2002 the company has other smaller pension plans acquired related to acquisitions included in note 12 to the companys financial statements the company accounts for these defined benefit plan in accordance with fasb asc topic 715 compensation retirement benefits  and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs with the assistance of the actuary the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets the discount rate and other factors and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 

the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes the investments strategy and the views of our investment adviser differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years therefore the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense the companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets is seven percent which is unchanged from the prior year 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company utilizes a yield curve approach the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the companys expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecasted and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds the discount rate was 551 percent as of december 31 2010 compared to 601 percent in 2009 and 681 percent in 2008 a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation 

as set forth in note 12 to the companys financial statements included among the asset categories for the plans investments are real estate tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds these investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant nonobservable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value in accordance with asu no 200912  investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds financial statements for reasonableness 

as of december 31 2010 the defined benefit plans were underfunded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders equity by 12 million before tax

 item 1a risk factors 

we may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the competitive pest control industry in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitive prices and general economic issues we compete with other large pest control companies as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are product and service quality and availability terms of guarantees reputation for safety technical proficiency and price although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service is excellent we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our competitive position 

economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to most of our residential customers as consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers including food service hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies for example we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider 

we may not be able to identify complete or successfully integrate acquisitions 

acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy we cannot assure that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future we cannot assure that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions 

our operations are directly affected by the weather conditions across the united states and canada the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the companys pest and termite control services the increase in pest pressure and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the companys pest and termite control operations during such periods the business of the company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods 

our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability 

our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force the demand for skilled employees is high and the supply is very limited a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force increases in the wage rates paid by us or both if either of these events occurred our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired 

our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation 

in the normal course of business some of the companys subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged as a result of the rendering of services the company does not believe that any pending claim proceeding or litigation either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position however it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters however unlikely could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter 

our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws 

our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws we are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted we believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations we also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date however such environmental laws are changed frequently we are unable to predict whether environmental laws will in the future materially affect our operations and financial condition penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses fines and other corrective actions which would negatively affect our future financial results 

the companys management has a substantial ownership interest public stockholders may have no effective voice in the companys management 

the company has elected the controlled company exemption under rule 303a of the new york stock exchange nyse company guide the company is a controlled company because a group that includes the companys chairman of the board r randall rollins his brother gary w rollins who is the president chief executive officer and chief operating officer also a director of the company certain companies under their control and the nephew of r randall rollins and son of gary w rollins glen w rollins who is the vice president of rollins inc controls in excess of fifty percent of the companys voting power as a controlled company the company need not comply with certain nyse rules 

rollins incs executive officers directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership in the aggregate approximately 57 percent of the companys outstanding shares of common stock as a result these persons will effectively control the operations of the company including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company at a premium

for the year ended december 31 2009 the company had net income of 840 million compared to 689 million in 2008 a 218 increase the company achieved a 52 increase in revenue with all business lines contributing to the growth again our ability to grow during very challenging economic conditions confirms our belief that the company is recession resistant additionally the company was effective in controlling cost as gross margin improved 11 percentage points to 487 for 2009 versus 476 for 2008 sales general and administrative expense also showed a small improvement 2009 was 331 of revenue versus 332 in 2008 while there was a small deterioration in depreciation margin 35 in 2009 versus 33 in 2008 it is a result of our investments in acquisitions most notably hometeam and crane 

unlike many other companies we have been able to direct our business so that the weak economy has not had a serious impact the companys business model provides for strength from recurring revenues and a diverse customer base our largest twenty customers are less than 35 of our total revenues the 2009 revenue growth was due to an expanded sales force an emphasis on customer retention and acquisitions this coupled with strong cost management and innovative tax strategies led to the 218 increase in net income

the impact that the companys contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows 



1 the company estimates interest on outstanding borrowings under the line of credit to be less than 10 million for the period of less than one year 2 these amounts represent expected payments with interest for unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2009 uncertain tax positions of 06 million are not included due to the uncertainty of the final amount and settlement date 3 minimum pension funding requirements are not included as funding will not be required the company is considering making a contribution to the pension plan of 50 million 

critical accounting policies 

the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult complex or subjective judgments the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows 

subsequent events —the company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued as of the filing date february 25 2010 there were no subsequent events that would affect its financial statements 

accrual for termite contracts —the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications repairs and associated labor and chemicals settlements awards and other costs relative to termite control services factors that may impact future cost include chemical life expectancy and government regulation it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the companys business practices however it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims positive changes to our business practices include revisions made to our contracts more effective treatment methods more effective termiticides and expanding training 

accrued insurance —the company selfinsures up to specified limits certain risks related to general liability workers compensation and vehicle liability the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the selfinsurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims the company contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information the actuarial study is a major consideration along with managements knowledge of changes in business practices and existing claims compared to current balances the reserve is established based on all these factors due to the uncertainty associated with the estimation of future 

loss and expense payments and inherent limitations of the data actual developments may vary from the companys projections this is particularly true since critical assumptions regarding the parameters used to develop reserve estimates are largely based upon judgment therefore changes in estimates may be material managements judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside managements knowledge and control additionally historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events it should be noted that the number of claims have been decreasing due to the companys proactive risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs initiatives that have been implemented include preemployment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers postoffer physicals for new employees and prehire random and postaccident drug testing the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a red alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limitedduty basis 

revenue recognition —the companys revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed for certain revenue types because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services certain accounting estimates are utilized residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly bimonthly or quarterly basis while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month in general pest control customers sign an initial oneyear contract and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed for pest control customers the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation the company recognizes revenue for the delivery of the monitoring stations initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and installation of the monitoring services the amount deferred is the fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service fair values are generally established based on the prices charged when sold separately by the company the amount deferred for the undelivered monitoring element is then recognized as income on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straightline basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits 

revenue received for termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term and the cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred for outstanding claims an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current factors and historical information the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts these costs are incurred over the contract term as the revenue is being deferred the future cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred the company accrues for noticed claims the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses 

contingency accruals —the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codificationtm asc topic 450 contingencies the company estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued however in the opinion of management 

the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations 

defined benefit pension plan —in 2002 the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the defined benefit plan although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through march 2002 the company accounts for the defined benefit plan in accordance with fasb asc topic 715 compensation retirement benefits  and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs with the assistance of the actuary the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets the discount rate and other factors and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 

the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes the investments strategy and the views of our investment adviser differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years therefore the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense the companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets is seven percent which is a one percent reduction from the prior years eight percent 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company utilizes a yield curve approach the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the companys expected benefit payments over the life of the plan is forecasted and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds the discount rate was 601 percent as of december 31 2009 compared to 681 percent in 2008 and 625 percent in 2007 a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation 

as of december 31 2009 the defined benefit plan was underfunded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income decreased stockholders equity by 458 thousand before tax

 item 1a risk factors 

we may not be able to compete in the competitive pest control industry in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitive prices and general economic issues we compete with other large pest control companies as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are product and service quality and availability terms of guarantees reputation for safety technical proficiency and price although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service is excellent we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our competitive position 

economic conditions may adversely affect our business 

pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to most of our residential customers as consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers including food service hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies for example we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider 

we may not be able to identify complete or successfully integrate acquisitions 

acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy we cannot assure that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future we cannot assure that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions 

our operations are directly affected by the weather conditions across the united states and canada the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the companys pest and termite control services the increase in pest pressure and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the companys pest and termite control operations during such periods the business of the company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods 

our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability 

our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force the demand for skilled employees is high and the supply is very limited a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force increases in the wage rates paid by us or both if either of these events occurred our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired 

our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation 

in the normal course of business orkin one of the companys subsidiaries is a defendant in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged as a result of the rendering of services by orkin the company does not believe that any pending claim proceeding or litigation either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position however it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters however unlikely could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter 

our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws 

our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws we are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted we believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations we also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date however such environmental laws are changed frequently we are unable to predict whether environmental laws will in the future materially affect our operations and financial condition penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses fines and other corrective actions which would negatively affect our future financial results 

the companys management has a substantial ownership interest public stockholders may have no effective voice in the companys management 

the company has elected the controlled company exemption under rule 303a of the new york stock exchange nyse company guide the company is a controlled company because a group that includes the companys chairman of the board r randall rollins his brother gary w rollins who is the president chief executive officer and chief operating officer also a director of the company certain companies under their control and the nephew of r randall rollins and son of gary w rollins glen w rollins who is the vice president of rollins inc controls in excess of fifty percent of the companys voting power as a controlled company the company need not comply with certain nyse rules 

rollins incs executive officers directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership in the aggregate approximately 56 percent of the companys outstanding shares of common stock as a result these persons will effectively control the operations of the company including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company at a premium

1 the company estimates interest on outstanding borrowings under the line of credit to be approximately 12 million for the period of less than one year 2 these amounts represent expected payments with interest for unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2008 uncertain tax positions of 08 million are not included due to the uncertainty of the final amount and settlement date 3 minimum pension funding requirements are not included as such amounts have not been determined critical accounting policies 

the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult complex or subjective judgments the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows 

accrual for termite contracts —the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications repairs and associated labor and chemicals settlements awards and other costs relative to termite control services factors that may impact future cost include chemical life expectancy and government regulation it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the companys business practices however it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims positive changes to our business practices include revisions made to our contracts more effective treatment methods more effective termiticides and expanding training 

accrued insurance —the company selfinsures up to specified limits certain risks related to general liability workers compensation and vehicle liability the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the selfinsurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims the company contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information the actuarial study is a major consideration along with managements knowledge of changes in business practices and existing claims compared to current balances the reserve is established based on all these factors due to the uncertainty associated with the estimation of future loss and expense payments and inherent limitations of the data actual developments may vary from the 

companys projections this is particularly true since critical assumptions regarding the parameters used to develop reserve estimates are largely based upon judgment therefore changes in estimates may be material managements judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside managements knowledge and control additionally historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events it should be noted that the number of claims have been decreasing due to the companys proactive risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs initiatives that have been implemented include preemployment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers postoffer physicals for new employees and prehire random and postaccident drug testing the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a red alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limitedduty basis 

revenue recognition —the companys revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed for certain revenue types because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services certain accounting estimates are utilized residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly or bimonthly basis while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month in general pest control customers sign an initial oneyear contract and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed for pest control customers the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation the company recognizes revenue for the delivery of the monitoring stations initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and installation of the monitoring services the amount deferred is the fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service fair values are generally established based on the prices charged when sold separately by the company the amount deferred for the undelivered monitoring element is then recognized as income on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straightline basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits 

revenue received for traditional termite treatments is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term and the cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred for outstanding claims an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current factors and historical information the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts these costs are incurred over the contract term as the revenue is being deferred the future cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred the company accrues for noticed claims the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses 

as the revenue is being deferred the future cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred and no longer accrued the company will continue to accrue for noticed claims 

contingency accruals —the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5 accounting for contingencies the company estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and 

costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued however in the opinion of management the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations 

defined benefit pension plan —in 2002 the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the defined benefit plan although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through march 2002 the company accounts for the defined benefit plan in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 158 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs with the assistance of the actuary the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets the discount rate and other factors and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 

the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes the investments strategy and the views of our investment adviser differences between the expected longterm return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years therefore the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense the companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets is eight percent which is unchanged from the prior year 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year in estimating this rate the company utilizes a yield curve approach the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the companys expected benefit payments over the life of the plan is forecasted and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations the discount rate was 681 percent as of december 31 2008 compared to 625 percent in 2007 and 550 percent in 2006 a lower discount rate increases the value of benefit obligation 

as of december 31 2008 the defined benefit plan was underfunded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income decreased stockholders equity by 420 million before tax

competition

federal insecticide fungicide and rodentcide act fifra 

this federal law as amended grants to the states the responsibility to be the primary agent in enforcement and conditions under which pest control companies operate each state must meet certain guidelines of the environmental protection agency in regulating the following licensing record keeping contracts standards of application training and registration of products this allows each state to institute certain features that set their regulatory programs in keeping with special interests of the citizens wishes in each state the pest control industry is impacted by these federal and state regulations 

food quality protection act of 1996 fqpa

 item 1a risk factors 

we may not be able to compete in the competitive and technical pest control industry in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues and earnings may be affected by the following factors changes in competitive prices weather related issues general economic issues and governmental regulation we compete with other large pest control companies as well as numerous smaller pest control companies for a finite number of customers we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are product and service quality and availability terms of guarantees reputation for safety technical proficiency and price although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service is excellent we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our competitive position 

we may not be able to identify complete or successfully integrate acquisitions 

acquisitions have been and will continue to be an important element of our business strategy we cannot assure that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future we cannot assure that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions 

our operations are directly affected by the weather conditions across the united states and canada the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the companys pest and termite control services the increase in pest pressure and activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the companys pest and termite control operations during such periods 

our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability 

our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force the demand for skilled employees is high and the supply is very limited a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force increases in the wage rates paid by us or both if either of these events occurred our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired 

our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation 

in the normal course of business orkin one of the companys subsidiaries is a defendant in a number of lawsuits which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged as a result of the rendering of services by orkin orkin is actively contesting these actions some lawsuits or arbitrations have been filed  ernest w warren and dolores g warren et al v orkin exterminating company inc et al  and francis d petsch et al v orkin exterminating company inc et al  in which the plaintiffs are seeking certification of a class the cases originate in georgia and florida this includes mark and christine butland et al v orkin exterminating company inc et al pending in the circuit court of hillsborough county tampa florida in butland the court issued a ruling certifying this as a class action but orkin appealed this ruling to the florida second district court of appeals which in june 2006 denied certification of the class following the plaintiffs motion for rehearing the court upheld its prior decision that class certification was improper but also ruled that the plaintiffs can return to the trial court and attempt to certify a narrower class orkin will vigorously oppose any effort by the plaintiffs to do so in warren  the superior court of cobb county marietta georgia ruled in august 2006 certifying the class action against orkin orkin has appealed this ruling to the georgia court of appeals the company believes these matters to be without merit and intends to vigorously contest certification and defend itself through trial or arbitration if necessary in the opinion of management the outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of operations or liquidity 

our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws 

our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws we are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted we believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations we also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date however such environmental laws are changed frequently we are unable to predict whether environmental laws will in the future materially affect our operations and financial condition penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses fines and other corrective actions which would negatively affect our future financial results 

the companys management has a substantial ownership interest public stockholders may have no effective voice in the companys management 

the company has elected the controlled company exemption under rule 303a of the new york stock exchange nyse company guide the company is a controlled company because a group that includes the companys chairman of the board r randall rollins his brother gary w rollins who is the president chief executive officer and chief operating officer also a director of the company certain companies under their control and the nephew of r randall rollins and son of gary w rollins glen w rollins who is the vice president of rollins inc controls in excess of fifty percent of the companys voting power as a controlled company the company need not comply with certain nyse rules 

rollins incs executive officers directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership in the aggregate approximately 58 percent of the companys outstanding shares of common stock as a result these persons will effectively control the operations of the company including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company at a premium

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash flow

the company invested approximately 187 million in capital expenditures during the year ended december 31 2006 capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily of equipment replacements and upgrades and improvements to the companys management information systems the company expects to invest between 120 million and 150 million in 2007 in capital expenditures during 2006 the company made several acquisitions totaling 101 million compared to 272 million during 2005 the acquisitions were funded fully with cash from operations in 2006 the company continues to seek new acquisitions and will also give consideration to any attractive acquisition opportunities presented a total of 170 million was paid in cash dividends 00625 per share a quarter during the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 137 million or 005 per share a quarter during 2005 the company repurchased 1006680 shares of common stock in 2006 and there remain 2258644 shares authorized to be repurchased under prior board authorization the company maintains 700 million of credit facilities with commercial banks of which no borrowings were outstanding as of december 31 2006 the company maintains approximately 388 million in letters of credit which reduced its borrowing capacity under the credit facilities these letters of credit are required by the companys fronting insurance companies andor certain states due to the companys selffunded status to secure various workers compensation and casualty insurance contracts these letters of credit are established by the bank for the companys fronting insurance companies as collateral although the company believes that it has adequate liquid assets funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims 

orkin one of the companys subsidiaries is aggressively defending a class action lawsuit filed in hillsborough county tampa florida in early april 2002 the circuit court of hillsborough county certified the class action status of butland et al v orkin exterminating company inc et al  orkin appealed this ruling to the florida second district court of appeals which remanded the case back to the trial court for further findings in december 2004 the court issued a new ruling certifying the class action status orkin appealed this ruling to the florida second district court of appeals in june 2006 the florida second district court of appeals issued a ruling denying certification of the class following the plaintiffs motion for rehearing the court upheld its prior decision that class certification was improper but also ruled that the plaintiffs can return to the trial court and attempt to certify a narrower class orkin will vigorously oppose any effort by the plaintiffs to do so in ernest w warren and dolores g warren et al v orkin exterminating company inc et al  pending in the superior court of cobb county marietta georgia the court ruled in august 2006 certifying the class action against orkin orkin has appealed this 

ruling to the georgia court of appeals other lawsuits against orkin and in some instances the company are also being vigorously defended including the petsch case for further discussion see note 7 to the accompanying financial statements 

the company is currently under audit by the internal revenue service irs for tax years 2002 and 2003 the irs has issued notices of proposed adjustment with respect to various issues the company is currently reviewing its position regarding the adjustments and plans to defend against those adjustments that are without merit the company does not expect the resolution of these issues taken individually or in the aggregate to have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations 

the company made a contribution of 50 million to its defined benefit retirement plan the plan during 2006 and 2005 as a result of the plans funding status the company believes that it will make contributions in the amount of approximately 25 million in 2007 in the opinion of management additional plan contributions will not have a material effect on the companys financial position results of operations or liquidity 

off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments 

other than the operating leases disclosed in the table below the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that the companys contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows 

 1 minimum pension funding requirements are not included as such amounts have not been determined the company estimates that it will contribute approximately 25 million to the plan in fiscal 2007 critical accounting policies 

the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult complex or subjective judgments the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows 

accrual for termite contracts —the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications repairs and associated labor and chemicals settlements awards and other costs relative to termite control services factors that may impact future cost include chemical life expectancy and government regulation it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the companys business practices however it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims positive changes to our business practices include revisions made to our contracts more effective treatment methods that include a directedliquid and baiting program more effective termiticides and expanding training 

accrued insurance —the company selfinsures up to specified limits certain risks related to general liability workers compensation and vehicle liability the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the selfinsurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims the company contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information the actuarial study is a major consideration along with managements knowledge of changes in business practices and existing claims compared to current balances the reserve is established based on all these factors due to the uncertainty associated with the estimation of future loss and expense payments and inherent limitations of the data actual developments may vary from the companys projections this is particularly true since critical assumptions regarding the parameters used to develop reserve estimates are largely based upon judgment therefore changes in estimates may be material managements judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside managements knowledge and control additionally historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events it should be noted that the number of claims has been decreasing due to the companys proactive risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs initiatives that have been implemented include preemployment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers utilization of a global positioning system that has been fully deployed to company vehicles postoffer physicals for new employees and prehire random and postaccident drug testing the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a red alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limitedduty basis 

revenue recognition —the companys revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed for certain revenue types because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services certain accounting estimates are utilized residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly or bimonthly basis while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month in general pest control customers sign an initial oneyear contract and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed for pest control customers the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation the company recognizes revenue for the delivery of the monitoring stations initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and installation of the monitoring services the amount deferred is the fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service the amount deferred for the undelivered monitoring element is then recognized as income on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straightline basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits 

prior to 2004 traditional termite treatments were recognized as revenue at the renewal date and an accrual was established for estimated costs of reapplications and repairs to be incurred under the accounting method adopted in 2004 the revenue received is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining contract term and the cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred for outstanding claims an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current factors and historical information the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts these costs are incurred over the contract term the accounting principle adopted in 2004 eliminates the need to obtain actuarial estimates of the claim costs to be 

incurred and managements estimates of reapplication costs also management believes the newly adopted this accounting method more closely conforms to the current pattern under which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred and conforms to the accounting methodology of orkin and its subsidiary western pest services the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses 

due to this change in 2004 the company recorded a cumulative adjustment to reduce net income by 62 million net of income taxes as the revenue is being deferred the future cost of reinspections reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred and no longer accrued the company will continue to accrue for noticed claims 

contingency accruals —the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5 accounting for contingencies the company estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation however in the opinion of management the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations 

stockbased compensation —in december 2004 the fasb issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards or fas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation the revision is referred to as fas 123r – sharebased payment or fas 123r which supersedes apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees or apb 25 and will require companies to recognize compensation expense using a fairvalue based method for costs related to sharebased payments including stock options and stock issued under our employee stock plans we have adopted fas 123r using the modified prospective basis on january 1 2006 our adoption of fas 123r resulted in compensation expense reduced diluted net income per share by approximately 001 per share for 2006 stockbased compensation expense is affected by our stock price as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation assumptions and the related tax effect these valuation assumptions include but are not limited to the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors

benefit plans an employer is also required to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its yearend statement of financial position with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income sfas 158 also requires certain disclosures regarding the effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of gains or losses prior service costs or credits and the transition asset or obligation the company was required to recognize the funded status of the plan in its financial statements for the year ended december 31 2006 the company had previously recognized the funded status of the plan in prior financial statements see note 8 – employee benefit and stock compensation plans for additional information related to this plans the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the yearend statement of financial position is effective for the companys financial statements beginning with the year ended after december 15 2008 the company currently uses december 31 as the measurement date for the plans

general operating comments

emphasis on customer retention and building recurring revenues  was the primary
driver of revenue  growth of 160 in the fourth  quarter and 109 for the year

weather from four hurricanes in florida and other parts of the country in 2004

     the  financial  results for the fourth  quarter and the twelve months ended
december  31  2004 were  positively  impacted by the  continued  benefit of our
everyothermonth  residential pest control service  which was 808 of all new

control services and termite directed liquid and baiting treatment

job completions and continued growth in recurring  revenues from bait monitoring
and renewal  revenues  although  termite  revenues for the twelve  months ended

and  cold  weather  in  parts of the us  in the  first  half of 2003  per the
national climatic data centers 109 years of tracking weather data temperatures
in the northeast region of the country were the 10th coldest on record  and the

revenues improved by 08 percentage  points  representing 535 of revenues for
the year ended  december  31  2003  compared  to 543 of revenues in the prior
year the dollar increase was mainly due to an increase in fleet expenses  as a
result of higher fuel costs and a temporary spike in vehicle counts in the first
quarter as the company transitioned to a new fleet agreement and an increase in
fringe benefit costs due to higher  pension and group medical  costs  partially
offset  by  improvements  in  service  salaries  administrative  salaries  and
materials  and  supplies   service  technician  productivity  and  average  pay
continued  to  improve  which  leads  to  better  employee  retention  and  in

decreased 17 million or 07 and as a percentage of revenues improved by 09
percentage  points or 25  averaging 349 of total revenues compared to 358
for the prior year the improvement for the year was a result of the home office
process improvement initiative started in 2002 lower field administrative costs
as a result of technology and  organizational  investments  lower sales payroll
due to lower  staffing and partly from the  formation of inbound  call centers
and lower bad debt expenses due to better  collections  and  improvement  in the
receivables  aging  statistics  these were  partially  offset by higher  fringe
benefit costs advertising and an increase in the summer sales program costs

critical accounting policies

     we view  critical  accounting  policies to be those  policies that are very
important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations
and that require managements most difficult  complex or subjective  judgments
the circumstances  that make these judgments  difficult or complex relate to the
need for  management  to make  estimates  about the effect of  matters  that are
inherently  uncertain  we believe  our  critical  accounting  policies to be as
follows

     accrual  for  termite  contracts  the  company  maintains  an accrual for
     termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications  repairs
     and  associated  labor and chemicals  settlements  awards and other costs
     relative to termite control  services  factors that may impact future cost
     include  chemical  life  expectancy  and  government   regulation   it  is
     significant  that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years
     due to changes in the  companys  business  practices  however  it is not
     possible to precisely predict future significant  claims  positive changes
     to our business  practices  include  revisions made to our contracts  more
     effective  treatment  methods  that include a  directedliquid  and baiting
     program more effective termiticides and expanding training

     accrued  insurance  the company  selfinsures  up to  specified  limits
     certain  risks  related to general  liability  workers  compensation  and
     vehicle liability  the estimated costs of existing and future claims under
     the  selfinsurance  program are accrued  based upon  historical  trends as
     incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement
     of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently
     revised  based  on  developments  relating  to  such  claims  the  company
     contracts an independent  third party actuary on an annual basis to provide
     the  company  an  estimated   liability   based  upon   historical   claims
     information  the  actuarial  study is a major  consideration  along  with
     managements knowledge of

                                       25
page
     changes in  business  practices  and  existing  claims  compared to current
     balances the reserve is established based on all these factors due to the
     uncertainty  associated  with the  estimation  of future  loss and  expense
     payments and inherent limitations of the data actual developments may vary
     from the companys  projections  this is particularly  true since critical
     assumptions  regarding the parameters used to develop reserve estimates are
     largely  based  upon  judgment  therefore  changes  in  estimates  may be
     sufficiently material managements judgment is inherently subjective and a
     number  of  factors  are  outside   managements   knowledge  and  control
     additionally  historical  information is not always an accurate indication
     of future  events  it should be noted  that the  number of claims has been
     decreasing due to the companys  proactive  risk  management to develop and
     maintain ongoing programs  initiatives that have been implemented  include
     preemployment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all
     its drivers utilization of a global positioning system that has been fully
     deployed to our company vehicles  postoffer  physicals for new employees
     and  prehire  random and  postaccident  drug  testing  the  company has
     improved  the time  required  to report a claim by  utilizing a red alert

     revenue  recognition  the  companys  revenue  recognition  policies  are
     designed to  recognize  revenues at the time  services are  performed  for
     certain revenue types  because of the timing of billing and the receipt of
     cash versus the timing of performing services certain accounting estimates
     are  utilized   residential  and  commercial  pest  control  services  are
     primarily  recurring  in nature on a monthly  or  bimonthly  basis  while
     certain  types of  commercial  customers  may receive  multiple  treatments
     within a given month  in general  pest control  customers sign an initial
     oneyear  contract  and revenues are  recognized  at the time services are
     performed  for pest control  customers  the company offers a discount for
     those customers who prepay for a full year of services  the company defers
     recognition  of these advance  payments and  recognizes  the revenue as the
     services are rendered  the company classifies the discounts related to the
     advance  payments as a reduction in revenues  termite baiting revenues are
     recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting  at
     the  inception of a new baiting  services  contract  upon  quality  control
     review of the installation the company recognizes revenue for the delivery
     of the monitoring stations  initial directed liquid termiticide  treatment
     and  installation  of the monitoring  services  the amount deferred is the
     fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service
     the  amount  deferred  for  the  undelivered  monitoring  element  is  then
     recognized as income on a straightline  basis over the remaining  contract
     term   which  results  in   recognition  of  revenue  in  a  pattern  that
     approximates the timing of performing  monitoring  visits  baiting renewal
     revenue is deferred and  recognized  over the annual  contract  period on a
     straightline basis that approximates the timing of performing the required
     monitoring visits

          prior to 2004  traditional  termite  treatments  were  recognized  as
     revenue at the renewal date and an accrual was  established  for  estimated
     costs of reapplications and repairs to be incurred under the newly adopted
     accounting  method  the revenue  received is deferred and  recognized on a
     straightline  basis over the  remaining  contract  term  and the cost of
     reinspections   reapplications   and  repairs  and  associated  labor  and
     chemicals are expensed as incurred  for outstanding claims an estimate is
     made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current
     factors and historical information  the performance of reinspections tends
     to be close to the contract  renewal  date and  while  reapplications  and
     repairs involve an insubstantial  number of the contracts  these costs are
     incurred over the contract  term  the newly adopted  accounting  principle
     eliminates the need to obtain actuarial  estimates of the claim costs to be
     incurred  and  managements   estimates  of  reapplication   costs   also
     management  believes  the newly  adopted  accounting  method  more  closely
     conforms  to the  current  pattern  under  which  revenues  are  earned and
     expenses are incurred and conforms the accounting methodology of orkin and
     its  recently  acquired  subsidiary  western pest  services  the costs of
     providing  termite  services  upon  renewal are  compared  to the  expected
     revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses

          due to this change  the company  recorded a cumulative  adjustment of
     62 million net of income taxes  as the revenue is being deferred  the
     future cost of  reinspections  reapplications  and repairs and  associated
     labor and  chemicals  applicable  to the  deferred  revenue are expensed as
     incurred and no longer  accrued  the company  will  continue to accrue for
     noticed claims

this document under financial  statements and supplementary data on pages 24 and
25 the  companys  results of operations  and its  financial  condition are not
reliant upon any single  customer or a few  customers or the  companys  foreign
operations

     a bimonthly pest control service  initiative was offered in limited markets
beginning in 1999 and was implemented as a primary  service  offering in 2000 to
better service our residential customers  and has grown to represent 55 of the
residential  customer  base at the end of 2003  this program  provides  greater
convenience  to our  customers  and enables  the  company to achieve  technician
productivity improvements and other service efficiencies  including lower fleet
costs

     in order to better  understand  its  customers and  prospects  in 2003 the
company initiated market research efforts to help identify specific  residential
pest control market segments three segments were determined to be the ideal new
customer groups for orkin these are sectors that the company believes offer the
best  opportunity  to  create  long  and  prosperous  relationships  management
believes  that all of these  groups are willing to pay a higher price for a pest
control  service that meets their needs  they  indicated a desire for a company
with a strong  positive  reputation  and one with  the  most  professional  and
knowledgeable  technicians  they also want to do business  with a company whose
service will be safe for their  children and pets and a firm that is responsive
to their requests  these are attributes that orkin delivers every day however
this validation will enable the company to do a better job  communicating  these
strengths

     to  effectively  and  efficiently  achieve  sales  goals in todays  highly
competitive environment  representatives have a greater need for new technology
to help them improve their  productivity  orkin began testing  automated  sales
management  software in 2003 this software is currently being used to track the
sales  process  allowing the  pipelines to be easily  reviewed to capitalize on
opportunities  that are readily  identified  account  information  statistics
contact information future tasks and events are tracked by location with upward
flow  to the  sales  management  organization  the  reporting  and  forecasting
features also enable management to have a better overview and expectation of the
entire network

     the  company  has also  reorganized  its  marketing  department  to include
business  development  managers  bdm  each bdm is responsible  for creating a
market  development plan for future customer growth and retention for his or her
division  they provide advocacy by working with local  regional and divisional
management  to ensure  the  success  of their  division  as it  relates to sales
training new customer marketing and sales plan achievement

teachers association nsta that is designed to assist teachers in educating the
countrys  youth  about the  importance  of  insects  in the  environment  as a
partner  we are  providing  teaching and  instructional  materials  directly to
teachers and through the

grocery  retailers  fast food  healthcare  and  restaurants  as the  nations

locallyowned  businesses  a primary  goal of the  company is to grow  national
account  revenue  at a pace that will  enable us to  further  expand  our market
share

     orkin introduced the gold medal protection  program in the united states in
2003 this customdesigned pest control service is targeted to specific highend
customers  primarily in the food  manufacturing  and  processing  industry  the
program  provides a comprehensive  reporting system that meets federal and state
regulatory requirements  it also guarantees free retreatment if the customer is
not satisfied and orkin commits to paying any  regulatory  penalties as a result
of a shortfall  in our service  this is the first pest  control  program of its
kind in north america to receive iso 9002 certification

     also in 2003 the company also introduced a commercial pest control quality
assurance program  this program helps ensure consistent  service  improves our
personnel  and  builds  stronger  customer   relations   the  program  utilizes
floorlevel  inspections by orkin qa  inspectors while  accompanied by branch
region and on occasion division management staff a new commercial pest control
expectation  manual was  developed for our branches to clearly  communicate  the
companys service expectations and our locations and people are audited against
this manual

     research has shown that termites  cause more damage to american  structures
than fires and storms combined  orkin offers a treatment customized to a homes
needs including inside  outside and within the foundation  our directed liquid
and directed  liquid plus bait programs have been developed in conjunction  with
the entomology departments at leading universities as a result our approach to
treating for subterranean  termites has become the standard adopted by most pest
control operators today

     orkin  is  leveraging   recent   investments   in  technology  and  process
improvement  to advance  business  practices in the  commercial  business  line
reengineering  efforts are targeted at  enhancing  integration  between  sales
customer management  service delivery and billing processes to provide a higher
level of service to these customers

     in 2003 the company successfully launched its new intranet which provides
quick and efficient  communications  between the field and home office  through
the efforts of our company webmaster and the web advisory committee  there were
several key  milestones  achieved this year the intranet  provided  significant
cost savings by providing material safety data sheets and product labels through
myorkin   intranet   this  is  a  very  important   requirement   that  enables
instantaneous  compliance  with state and federal product use  regulations  the
orkin  training   department  now  has  a  stateoftheart  means  to  better
communicate  the  availability  of an  elaborate  array of  training  tools  and
reference materials through the myorkintraining site the  myorkinmarketplace
another company intranet  address  was created for branches to more efficiently
order promotional products and company forms

     in  2003  orkin  began  outsourcing  some  of  its  chemical  distribution
utilizing new internet  branch systems to ease ordering of product  test branch
locations  are now  receiving  shipments in two to four days while  reducing the
carrying cost of excess inventory and shipping costs

     the global positioning system gps technology introduced three years ago
has  resulted  in improved  driver  safety and service  production  now  newer
generation  gps units are  being  installed  that  allow 24  7  monitoring  and
reporting  of speed  location  and seatbelt  usage as well as allowing  remote
updating of mapping  software  this technology also details the route a service
technician takes rather than just noting stops  these units create reports that
are  easier  to read and  allow  data to be sent  directly  to a server  with no
removable chip to be taken out at the end of the day although this equipment is
only being utilized in some of our locations  we are optimistic that it will be
a building block to creating a comprehensive  routing and scheduling system in
the future

     as part of our continuous home office process improvement  mandate a human
resources  service center was  established  from three  autonomous  departments
payroll  benefits and human  resources  everything from newhire  paperwork to
retirement forms is now available  through this new center  we are pleased that
this consolidation has improved our service to the field while reducing costs

100 companies to excel in training and employee development  in addition orkin
was one of only five companies selected for the magazines editors choice list

environments for their workforce

     orkin attained  further  recognition  this year for its training program by
achieving  first place honors for the best award given by the  american  society
for training and development  the rollins training center  located in atlanta
was specifically  referenced as evidence of the companys dedication to employee
performance  improvement  the rollins training center has a fullsize house and
several other real examples of building structures where technicians can see the
relationship  between  pests  and home  construction  they  can  also  practice
performing pest treatments  under the supervision of qualified  instructors  in
the classrooms technicians acquire guidance in customer relations pest problem
solving and advanced technical skills through highly interactive  instructorled
training

contractual  buyback  provision at the  companys  option with a  predetermined
purchase price using a formula applied to revenues of the franchise  there were
44 company franchises at the end of 2003 compared to 36 at the end of 2002

seasonality

     the  business  of the company is  affected  by the  seasonal  nature of the
companys pest and termite control  services  the increase in pest pressure and
activity as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the
occurrence of which is  determined by the timing of the change in seasons  has
historically  resulted in an increase in the revenue of the  companys  pest and
termite  control  operations  during such periods as evidenced by the  following
chart

spring of 2004

environmental and regulatory considerations

     the companys pest control  business is subject to various  legislative and
regulatory  enactments  that are  designed  to protect the  environment  public
health and consumer protection compliance with these requirements has not had a
material  negative  effect  on the  companys  financial  position  results  of
operations or liquidity

federal insecticide fungicide and rodentcide act fifra

     this federal law as amended grants the responsibility of the states to be
the  primary  agent in  enforcement  and  conditions  under  which pest  control
companies operate  each state must meet certain guidelines of the environmental
protection  agency in  regulating  the  following  licensing  record  keeping
contracts standards of application training and registration of products this
allows  each  state to  institute  certain  features  that set their  regulatory
programs in keeping  with  special  interests  of the  citizens  wishes in each
state  the pest  control  industry  is  impacted  by these  federal  and  state
regulations

food quality protection act of 1996 fqpa

     the fqpa governs the manufacture  labeling handling and use of pesticides
and does not have a direct impact on how we conduct our business

environmental remediation

     the comprehensive  environmental  response  compensation and liability act
cercla  also known as superfund  is the primary federal statute regulating
the cleanup of inactive  hazardous  substance  sites and imposing  liability for
cleanup on the responsible  parties  responsibilities  governed by this statute
include the management of hazardous substances  reporting releases of hazardous
substances  and establishing the necessary  contracts and agreements to conduct

direction of the responsible state agency to agree and implement a plan for site
remediation

employees

     the number of persons  employed by the company as of february  27 2004 was
approximately 7300 compared to 7600 at december 31 2002 this decrease in the
number of employees is due to the continued transition to everyothermonth pest
control service which has resulted in the need for fewer technicians

risk factors

we may not be able to compete in the  competitive  and  technical  pest  control
industry in the future

     we operate in a highly competitive industry  our revenues and earnings may
be affected by the following  factors  changes in competitive  prices  weather
related issues general economic issues and governmental regulation  we compete
with other large pest control companies  as well as numerous small pest control
companies  for a finite  number of  customers  we  believe  that the  principal
competitive  factors in the market  areas that we serve are  product and service
quality and  availability  reputation  for safety  technical  proficiency  and
price  although we believe that our  experience  and  reputation for safety and
quality service is excellent  we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain
our competitive position

we  may  not  be  able  to  identify   complete  or  successfully   consolidate
acquisitions

     acquisitions  have been and will continue to be an important element of our
business strategy we cannot assure that we will be able to identify and acquire
acceptable  acquisition  candidates on terms  favorable to us in the future  we
cannot assure that we will be able to  consolidate  successfully  the operations
and assets of any acquired business with our own business  any inability on our
part to consolidate and manage the growth from acquired  businesses could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions

     our operations are directly  affected by the weather  conditions across the
united  states and  canada  the  business  of the  company is  affected  by the
seasonal nature of the companys pest and termite control services the increase
in pest pressure and activity  as well as the  metamorphosis of termites in the
spring and summer the  occurrence  of which is  determined by the timing of the
change in seasons  has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and
income of the companys pest and termite control operations during such periods

our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth  potential
and profitability

     our ability to remain  productive and profitable will depend  substantially
on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers  our ability to expand our
operations is in part  impacted by our ability to increase our labor force  the
demand  for  skilled  employees  is high  and the  supply  is very  limited  a
significant  increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a
reduction in our skilled labor force increases in the wage rates paid by us or
both if either of these events occurred  our capacity and profitability  could
be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired

our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation

     in the  normal  course of  business  orkin is a  defendant  in a number of
lawsuits  including helen cutler and mary lewin v orkin exterminating company
inc et al pending in the district court of houston county alabama

and butland et al v orkin  exterminating  company  inc et al pending in the
circuit  court  of  hillsborough  county   tampa  florida  which  allege  that
plaintiffs  have been damaged as a result of the  rendering of services by orkin
personnel  and  equipment  orkin is actively  contesting  these  actions  some
lawsuits have been filed ernest w warren and dolores g warren et al v orkin
exterminating company inc et al elizabeth allen and william allen et al v
rollins inc and orkin exterminating  company  inc francis d petsch et al
v  orkin  exterminating  company  inc  et al  and bob j  stevens  v orkin
exterminating  company  inc and  rollins  inc in which the  plaintiffs  are
seeking  certification of a class the cases originate in georgia  florida and
texas  the company  believes them to be without merit and intends to vigorously
contest  certification  and defend itself  through trial  if necessary  in the
opinion of  management  the outcome of these  actions  will not have a material
adverse  effect on the companys  financial  position  results of operations or
liquidity

our  operations  may be  adversely  affected  if we are  unable to  comply  with
regulatory and environmental laws

     our  business is  significantly  affected by  environmental  laws and other
regulations  relating to the pest  control  industry and by changes in such laws
and the level of enforcement of such laws we are unable to predict the level of
enforcement of existing laws and regulations  how such laws and regulations may
be interpreted by enforcement  agencies or court rulings  or whether additional
laws  and  regulations  will be  adopted  we  believe  our  present  operations
substantially  comply with applicable  federal and state  environmental laws and
regulations  we also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material
adverse effect on our operations to date  however  such environmental laws are
changed frequently we are unable to predict whether environmental laws will in
the future materially affect our operations and financial condition  penalties
for noncompliance with these laws may include  cancellation of licenses  fines
and other corrective actions which would negatively affect our future financial

general operating comments

     the companys continued emphasis on customer retention along with building
recurring  revenues  was the  primary  driver of revenue  growth of 30 in the
fourth  quarter and 17 for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to the
prior year periods  despite a sluggish  economy and  unseasonably  wet and cold
weather conditions in parts of the us in the first half of 2003 revenues were
up 12 in the first  quarter  05 in the second quarter and 24 in the third
quarter as compared to the prior year periods

     the  financial  results for the fourth  quarter and the twelve months ended
december  31  2003 were  positively  impacted by the  continued  benefit of our
recent service initiatives  which included  everyothermonth  residential pest
control  service  gold medal  premium  commercial  pest control  services  and
termite directed liquid and baiting treatment

     for the fourth  quarter of 2003 the company had net income of 48 million
compared  to net income of 37  million in the  fourth  quarter of 2002  which
represents a 295  increase  in addition to the revenue  increase of 30 the
company  achieved  margin  improvement  in  cost  of  services  provided  of 13
percentage points expressed as a percentage of revenues  offset by an increase
in sales  general  and  administrative  expenses  of 04 margin  points or 22
million due to higher marketing expenses  in addition  the company recorded an
increase in its tax provision of approximately 11 million as describes further
below

     for the year ended  december 31 2003  the company had net income of 358

services  provided  of  08  percentage   points  and  in  sales   general  and
administrative of 09 percentage points

of 212 million  compared to 297 million for 2002 the company had total cash

revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 were 6770  million  an increase
of 116  million  or 17 from last  years  revenues  of 6654  million  the
companys revenue growth was very similar across its primary services which are
residential  pest control  commercial pest control  and termite  service  the
growth in pest  control  revenues for the year  reflects  growth in the customer
base  better  average  selling  prices   continued  improvements  in  customer
retention and successful price increase campaigns  everyothermonth  service
our primary  residential  pest control  service  offering  continues to grow in
importance  comprising  55 of our  residential  pest control  customer base at
december 31 2003 in commercial pest control  the company continued to receive
favorable  reaction  to the  rollout of its premium  gold medal  service  which
specifically  targets food  processing  and  manufacturing  companies  and also
achieved  improvements  in  average  prices on new sales  and  successful  price
increases from existing customers  this past summer orkin began test marketing
a mosquito  control  program in the  northern  united  states and canada  while
working to address the threat of  mosquitoborne  diseases in the us a highly
successful west nile virus preventative program was also implemented in ontario
canada  two  provinces  were  provided  thousands  of larvicide  treatments  to
mosquito  breeding grounds reducing the population of adult mosquitoes and their
eggs the company intends  to expand the mosquito  control program in canada and
other us  markets in the spring of 2004 as another sign of  strengthening  in
the commercial  market  the company  achieved a monthly record high of sales to
national accounts in september 2003

termite  revenues  increased in the fourth quarter as a result of higher new job
completions and continued growth in recurring  revenues from bait monitoring and
renewal revenues although termite revenues for the twelve months ended december
31 2003  decreased  slightly  mainly as a result of the unusually wet and cold
weather  in parts of the  us  in the  first  half of  2003  per the  national
climatic data centers 109 years of tracking  weather data  temperatures in the
northeast  region  of the  country  were the 10th  coldest  on  record  and the
southeast  experienced  the  second  wettest  six month  period on  record  the
companys  foreign  operations  accounted for approximately 6 of total revenues
for the year ended december 31 2003

the business of the company is affected by the seasonal  nature of the companys
pest and termite control services as evidenced by the following chart

                                           total net revenues

cost of services  provided for the year ended  december 31 2003  increased 11
million or 03  although  the expense  margin  expressed  as a  percentage  of
revenues improved by 08 percentage  points  representing 535 of revenues for
the year ended  december  31  2003  compared  to 543 of revenues in the prior
year the dollar increase was mainly due to an increase in fleet expenses  as a
result of higher fuel costs and a temporary spike in vehicle counts in the first
quarter as the company transitioned to a new fleet agreement and an increase in
fringe benefit costs due to higher  pension and group medical  costs  partially
offset  by  improvements  in  service  salaries  administrative  salaries  and
materials  and  supplies   service  technician  productivity  and  average  pay
continued  to  improve  which  leads  to  better  employee  retention  and  in
managements opinion improved customer retention

sales general and administrative for the year ended december 31 2003 decreased
17  million  or  07  and  as a  percentage  of  revenues  improved  by 09
percentage  points or 25  averaging 349 of total revenues compared to 358
for the prior year the improvement for the year was a result of the home office
process improvement initiative started in 2002 lower field administrative costs
as a result of technology and  organizational  investments  lower sales payroll
due to lower  staffing and partly from the  formation of inbound  call centers
and lower bad debt expenses due to better  collections  and  improvement  in the
receivables  aging  statistics  these were  partially  offset by higher  fringe
benefit costs advertising and an increase in the summer sales program costs

depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 were
15 million or 67 lower than the prior year  the decrease was due to certain
technology  assets  becoming fully  depreciated  in the last twelve months  the
company had approximately 106 million in capital  expenditures during the year
ended december 31 2003 compared to 104 million in 2002

in  addition  the company  realized a net gain of 17 million from the sale or
disposal of assets in the fourth quarter of 2003

the  companys  effective tax rate was 380 for the periods prior to the fourth
quarter  of 2003  the  effective  tax rate  was  increased  to 404 in 2003 to
reflect an increase in the effective state income tax rate for the year as well
as true up adjustments in the fourth quarter of approximately 11 million as
a result the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter increased to 524

results of operations  2002 versus 2001

revenues for the year ended  december 31 2002 increased to 6654  million  an
increase  of 155  million or 24 from 2001  revenues of 6499  million  the
companys  foreign  operations  made up less  than 60 of the  companys  total
revenues in 2002 and 2001  the revenue  increase was mainly  attributable  to a
modest increase in revenues from pest control services as termite revenues were
flat with the prior  year  the growth in pest  control  revenues  reflects  the
beneficial  impact of better  customer  retention  and a successful  residential
summer  sales  program  factors  that  combined  to  produce  a net gain in the
customer base as well as higher  average  selling  prices  within the us the
company had an improvement in customer retention a modest increase in new sales
units and an overall  improvement  in average  selling  prices  resulting  in a
higher ending customer base at the end of the year  everyothermonth  service
our primary  residential  pest control  service  offering  continued to grow in
importance  comprising almost 50 of our residential pest control customer base
at the end of 2002 our commercial  revenues grew  mainly as a result of better
pricing  on new  sales  a  successful  price  increase  campaign  for  existing
customers in 2002 and the  introduction of new products and services during the
year  although  termite revenues were flat in 2002 as a result of a decrease in
sales to new  customers  the company  experienced  an  improvement in recurring

                                       17
page
revenues  mainly from  enhanced  renewal  retention  and higher bait  monitoring
services  despite the decrease in termite sales dollars the company managed to
achieve a slight improvement in average selling prices

cost of  services  provided  for the year  ended  december  31  2002  decreased
603000 or 02 and margins  improved by 14  percentage  points  representing
543 of  revenues  in 2002  compared  to 557 of  revenues  in the prior year
improvement for the year ended december 31 2002 can be mainly attributed to the
companys recent service initiatives that have increased  productivity  reduced
headcount  and created other  efficiencies  and better asset  utilization  the
company achieved  reductions in service  salaries  personnel  related expenses
materials and supplies travel and fleet expense which were partially offset by
slightly  higher  insurance  and  claims  charges   pest  control  and  termite
technician  productivity  improved  as  did  employee  retention  the  company
believes  that  better  employee  retention  has a  direct  impact  on  customer
retention  better fleet  management  led to a decrease in the average number of
vehicles and an improvement in revenues per vehicle

sales general and administrative for the year ended december 31 2002 decreased
24 million or 10 and improved by 12 percentage  points in 2002  averaging
358 of total revenues  compared to 370 for the prior year  improvement  for
the year was mainly  attributed to reduced  personnel  related  expenses  fleet
expense   telephone  expense  travel  expense  bad  debt  expense  and  sales
promotions  partially  offset by higher  summer  selling  program  expense  and
advertising expense

depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december 31 2002 were
approximately  13 million or 66 higher than the prior year the increase was
primarily  due to the  depreciation  associated  with focus  the  companys new
proprietary  branch  computer  system  the rollout of focus to the branches was
completed in the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of the adoption of sfas no
142 the  amortization of goodwill has been  discontinued as of january 1 2002
causing a  decrease  in  goodwill  amortization  expense of  approximately  22
million partially offset by an increase in amortization  expense of 20 million
due to a change in the expected life of customer contracts

the loss on sale of assets for the year ended  december 31 2002 of 762000 was
mainly due to the writeoff of obsolete field it equipment

net income for the year ended december 31 2002 includes the effects of adopting
sfas no  142  which did not have a material  impact on the  companys  overall
results of operations in addition if sfas no 142 had been adopted in the year
ended  december 31 2001 it would not have had a material  impact on net income
previously reported for the year ended december 31 2001

the companys  tax  provision of 166  million for the year ended  december 31
2002 reflects  increased  taxable  income over the prior year the effective tax
rate of 38 was consistent between periods presented

the hourly wage paid to lor inc was 32 per hour which equated to 66560 per

material effect on the companys  financial  position  results of operations or
liquidity

     employees  of rollins  inc  confer with  employees  of lor  inc and rrr
associates and vice versa  no fees are charged for these services  because  in
the opinion of management the activity is mutually beneficial and offsetting

critical accounting policies

     we view  critical  accounting  policies to be those  policies that are very
important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations
and that require managements most difficult  complex or subjective  judgments
the circumstances  that make these judgments  difficult or complex relate to the
need for  management  to make  estimates  about the effect of  matters  that are
inherently  uncertain  we believe  our  critical  accounting  policies to be as
follows

     accrual  for  termite  contracts   the  company  maintains  an accrual for
     termite  contracts  representing  the  estimated  costs of  reapplications
     repair  claims  associated  labor and chemicals  settlements  awards and
     other costs relative to termite  control  services  performed  prior to the
     balance  sheet  date  the company  contracts  an  independent  third party
     actuary  on an annual  basis to provide  the  company  an  estimate  of the
     liability based

                                       19
page
     upon historical claims  information for the largest portion of the accrual
     in addition  management  estimates and accrues for costs outside the scope
     of the  actuarial  study  including the  estimated  costs of  retreatments
     representing costs to be incurred that are estimatable at the balance sheet
     date as well as liability and costs  associated with claims in litigation
     the actuarial study and historical  experience are major  considerations in
     determining  the accrual  balance  along with  managements  knowledge  of
     changes in  business  practices  contract  changes  ongoing  claims  and
     termite  remediation  trends the accrual is established based on all these
     factors  management makes judgments  utilizing these operational and other
     factors  but  recognizes  that they are  inherently  subjective  due to the
     difficulty in  predicting  settlements  and awards  other factors that may
     impact  future  cost  include   chemical  life  expectancy  and  government
     regulation  it is  significant  that  the  actual  number  of  claims  has
     decreased  in  recent  years  due  to  changes  in the  companys  business
     practices  however  it is  not  possible  to  accurately  predict  future
     significant  claims  positive  changes to our business  practices  include
     revisions made to our  contracts  more  effective  treatment  methods that
     include a directedliquid baiting program more effective termiticides and
     expanded training methods and techniques

     accrued  insurance   the company  selfinsures  up to  specified  limits
     certain  risks  related to general  liability  workers  compensation  and
     vehicle liability  the estimated costs of existing and future claims under
     the  selfinsurance  program are accrued  based upon  historical  trends as
     incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement
     of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently
     revised  based  on  developments  relating  to  such  claims  the  company
     contracts an independent  third party actuary on an annual basis to provide
     the  company  an  estimated   liability   based  upon   historical   claims
     information  the  actuarial  study is a major  consideration  along  with
     managements knowledge of changes in business practices and existing claims
     compared to current balances the reserve is established based on all these
     factors  managements  judgment is inherently  subjective  and a number of
     factors are  outside  managements  knowledge  and  control  additionally
     historical  information  is not  always an  accurate  indication  of future
     events  it should be noted that the  number of claims has been  decreasing
     due to the  companys  proactive  risk  management  to develop and maintain
     ongoing programs  however it is not possible to accurately predict future
     significant   claims   initiatives  that  have  been  implemented  include
     preemployment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all
     its drivers utilization of a global positioning system that has been fully
     deployed to our company vehicles  postoffer  physicals for new employees
     and  prehire  random and  postaccident  drug  testing  the  company has
     improved  the time  required  to report a claim by  utilizing a red alert
     program that provides serious accident  assessment  twenty four hours a day
     and seven days a week and has  instituted  a  modified  duty  program  that
     enables employees to go back to work on a limitedduty basis

     revenue  recognition   the  companys  revenue  recognition  policies  are
     designed to  recognize  revenues at the time  services are  performed  for
     certain revenue types  because of the timing of billing and the receipt of
     cash versus the timing of performing services certain accounting estimates
     are  utilized   residential  and  commercial  pest  control  services  are
     primarily  recurring  in nature on a monthly  or  bimonthly  basis  while
     certain  types of  commercial  customers  may receive  multiple  treatments
     within a given month  in general  pest control  customers sign an initial
     oneyear  contract  and revenues are  recognized  at the time services are
     performed  for pest control  customers  the company offers a discount for
     those customers who prepay for a full year of services  the company defers
     recognition  of these advance  payments and  recognizes  the revenue as the
     services are rendered  the company classifies the discounts related to the
     advance  payments as a reduction in revenues  termite baiting revenues are
     recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting  at
     the  inception of a new baiting  services  contract  upon  quality  control
     review of the installation the company recognizes revenue for the delivery
     of the monitoring stations  initial directed liquid termiticide  treatment
     and  installation  of the monitoring  services  the amount deferred is the
     fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service
     the  amount  deferred  for  the  undelivered  monitoring  element  is  then
     recognized as income on a straightline  basis over the remaining  contract
     term   which  results  in   recognition  of  revenue  in  a  pattern  that
     approximates the timing of performing  monitoring  visits  baiting renewal
     revenue is deferred and  recognized  over the annual  contract  period on a
     straightline basis that approximates the timing of performing the required
     monitoring visits traditional termite treatments are recognized as revenue
     at the time services are performed  traditional  termite contract renewals
     are  recognized  as  revenues  at the  renewal  date in order to match  the
     revenue with the approximate timing of the corresponding  service provided
     interest  income on  installment  receivables  is accrued  monthly based on
     actual loan balances and stated interest rates  franchise fees are treated
     as unearned revenue in the statement of financial position for the duration
     of the initial contract period royalties from orkin franchises are

     accrued and recognized as revenues as earned on a monthly  basis  gains on
     sales of pest control customer accounts to franchises are recognized at the
     time of sale and when collection is reasonably assured

     contingency  accruals  the  company is a party to legal  proceedings  with
     respect to matters in the ordinary  course of business  in accordance with
     statement  of  financial   accounting   standards  no  5  accounting  for
     contingencies  the company  estimates  and accrues for its  liability  and
     costs associated with the litigation estimates and accruals are determined
     in  consultation  with outside  counsel  it is not possible to  accurately
     predict the ultimate result of the litigation  however  in the opinion of
     management  the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse
     impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations

     the company  believes  its current  cash  balances  future cash flows from

credit will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations and
fund  expansion  of the  business  for the  foreseeable  future  the  companys
operations generated cash of 620 million for the year ended december 31 2003
compared with cash provided by operating activities of 537 million in 2002 and
296 million in 2001 the 2003 results were achieved  primarily from higher net
income and strong  advance  payments  received from  customers  the decrease in
longterm  accrued  liabilities  in 2003  was due to a 50  million  and a 98
million  contribution to the defined  benefit  retirement plan made in april and
december of 2003 respectively

     the company invested  approximately  106 million in capital  expenditures

contribution of 98 million to its defined benefit retirement plan the plan
during 2003 as a result of the plans  funding  status  upon  evaluation of the
plan as of december  31 2003  it was  determined  that the plans  accumulated

material effect on the companys  financial  position  results of operations or
liquidity

     the decline in the accrual for termite  contracts  of 26 million or 55
reflects  improvement in the  experience  rate the number of new termite claims

result of improved treatment techniques  more effective  termiticides  shorter
term guarantees and quality assurance  initiatives  accrued insurance decreased
29  million or 69 during the year as a result of improved  experience  rate
attributable  to the companys  proactive  management of issues  associated with

arrangements  with  multiple  deliverables   which  is  effective  for  revenue
arrangements  entered into in fiscal periods  beginning after june 15 2003 the
company adopted eitf 0021 in the third quarter of 2003 this eitf addresses how
to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple
products  services  andor rights to use assets the companys termite baiting
service involves multiple deliverables consisting of an initial directed liquid
termiticide   treatment   installation  of  termite  monitoring  stations  and
subsequent periodic monitoring  inspections  the portion of the termite baiting
service sales price applicable to subsequent  periodic  monitoring  inspections
which is determined  based on fair value  is deferred and  recognized  over the
first year of each  contract  the portion of the sales price  applicable to the
termiticide  treatment and installation of the monitoring services is determined
under the  residual  method  the total  sales  price less the fair value of the
monitoring   inspections   revenues   from  the   termiticide   treatment  and
installation of the termite monitoring  stations are recognized upon performance
of the  service  and  installation  the  adoption  of this  eitf did not have a
significant effect on the companys financial position results of operations or
liquidity

activity as well as the  metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer the

general operating comments

     the companys  continued emphasis on customer retention along with building
recurring revenues resulted in revenue growth of 24 in 2002 despite a sluggish
economy  the  financial  results for the fourth  quarter 2002 and the year were
positively impacted by the continued benefit of our recent service  initiatives
which included  everyothermonth  residential  pest control  service  acuridsm
premium  commercial  pest  control  services  and termite  directed  liquid and
baiting treatment

     for the fourth  quarter of 2002 the company had net income of 37 million
compared to net income of 16  million in the fourth  quarter of 2001  for the
year ended  december  31  2002  the  company  had net income of 271  million
compared to the prior year amount of 169  million  which  represents  a 600
increase  the overall  improvement  for the year in profit margins is largely a
result of improved cost of services provided and sales general  administrative
a percentage of revenues partially offset by higher depreciation

results of operations  2002 versus 2001

     revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 increased to 6654  million
an  increase  of 155  million  or 24 from  last  years  revenues  of 6499
million  the  companys  foreign  operations  made  up  less  than  60 of the
companys  total  revenues  in 2002 and 2001  the revenue  increase  was mainly
attributable  to a modest  increase in revenues from pest control  services  as
termite  revenues  were flat with the prior  year  the  growth in pest  control
revenues  reflects the  beneficial  impact of better  customer  retention  and a
successful residential summer sales program  factors that combined to produce a
net gain in the customer base as well as higher average selling  prices  within
the

us the company had an improvement in customer retention a modest increase in
new sales units and an overall improvement in average selling prices  resulting
in a  higher  ending  customer  base at the end of the  year  everyothermonth
service  our primary  residential pest control service  offering  continues to
grow in  importance  comprising  almost  50 of our  residential  pest  control
customer base at year end our commercial  revenues grew  mainly as a result of
better pricing on new sales a successful  price increase  campaign for existing
customers in 2002 and the  introduction of new products and services during the
year  although  termite revenues were flat in 2002 as a result of a decrease in
sales to new  customers  the company  experienced  an  improvement in recurring
revenues  mainly from  enhanced  renewal  retention  and higher bait  monitoring
services  despite the decrease in termite sales dollars the company managed to
achieve a slight improvement in average selling prices

     orkins  directed  liquid  termite  baiting  program  generates   recurring
monitoring  revenues  that are  deferred to the balance  sheet each month in the
form of unearned  revenue  this is then being recognized in future periods when
the service is rendered

     cost of services  provided for the year ended  december 31 2002  decreased
284000 or 01 and  margins  improved  by 14  points  representing  543 of
revenues in 2002  compared  to 557 of revenues in the prior year  improvement
for the year ended  december 31 2002 can be mainly  attributed to the companys
recent service initiatives that have increased productivity  reduced headcount
and  created  other  efficiencies  and better  asset  utilization  the  company
achieved reductions in service salaries  personnel related expenses  materials
and supplies  travel and fleet expense which were partially offset by slightly
higher  insurance  and claims  charges  pest  control  and  termite  technician
productivity  improved as did  employee  retention  the company  believes  that
better  employee  retention  has a direct impact on customer  retention  better
fleet  management  led to a decrease  in the average  number of vehicles  and an
improvement in revenues per vehicle

     sales  general and  administrative  for the year ended  december  31 2002
decreased  20  million or 08  and  improved  by 12 margin  points in 2002
averaging  358  of  total  revenues  compared  to 370  for the  prior  year
improvement  for the year was mainly  attributed  to reduced  personnel  related
expenses fleet expense telephone expense travel expense bad debt expense and
sales  promotions  partially offset by higher summer selling program expense and
advertising expense

     depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december 31 2002
were approximately 13 million or 66 higher than the prior year the increase
was primarily due to the  depreciation  associated with focus the companys new
proprietary  branch  computer  system  the rollout of focus to the branches was
completed in the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of the adoption of sfas no
142 the  amortization of goodwill has been  discontinued as of january 1 2002
causing a  decrease  in  goodwill  amortization  expense of  approximately  22
million partially offset by an increase in amortization  expense of 20 million
due to a change in the expected life of customer contracts

     net income for the year ended  december  31 2002  includes  the effects of
adopting  sfas no 142  which did not have a material  impact to the  companys
overall results of operations  in addition if sfas no 142 had been adopted in
the year ended december 31 2001 it would not have had a material impact to net
income previously reported for the year ended december 31 2001

     the  companys  net tax  provision  of 166  million  for the  year  ended
december 31 2002 reflects  increased  taxable  income over the prior year  the
effective tax rate of 38 was consistent between periods presented

     the decline in the accrual for termite  contracts  of 44  million or 87
reflects  improvement in the experience  rate as well as the payment of several
large termite claims and the cost of remediation  accrued  insurance  decreased
07  million or 16 during the year as a result of improved  experience  rate
attributable  to the companys  proactive  management of issues  associated with
self insured risks

results of operations  2001 versus 2000

     the 05  increase in  revenues  for the year ended  december  31 2001 was
primarily due to increased  recurring revenues in both pest and termite control
pest  control  benefited  from  improvement  in customer  retention  and a solid
increase in commercial  revenues  the increased recurring revenues from termite
control can be mainly attributed to the impact of the termite baiting program

     orkins  directed  liquid  termite  baiting  program  generates   recurring
monitoring  revenues  that are  deferred to the balance  sheet each month in the
form of unearned  revenue  this is then being recognized in future periods when
the service is rendered

     over the past  couple of years  the company  has  successfully  integrated
several pest control companies acquired in the united states and canada cost of
services  provided  decreased  70  million  compared to 2000  and improved to
represent 557 of revenues  compared to 570 in 2000 this margin  improvement
was primarily  attributable  to  productivity  improvements  and other increased
efficiencies  including a reduced  workforce  in  service  and  reductions  in
personnel  related  expenses and fleet expense that were partially  offset by an
increase  in  insurance   expense   depreciation  and  amortization   increased
approximately   19  million  or  102  over  2000   due   primarily  to  the
implementation  of our new  proprietary  branch computer  system  focus in the
fourth quarter of 2001

     sales  general and  administrative  decreased  40 million over 2000 and
improved  to  represent  370 of  revenues  compared  to  378  in 2000  this
improvement  as a  percentage  of  revenues  resulted  primarily  from  improved
efficiencies and a reduced workforce in sales decreased other personnel related
costs and decreased bad debt expense

     net interest  income  declined  252000 or 560 in 2001  primarily due to
lower interest rates on invested cash balances and higher  interest  expense for
notes payable associated with acquisitions

     the companys tax provision of 104 million as compared to 59 million in
2000 reflects increased income in 2001

     the decline in the accrual for termite  contracts  of 68 million or 118
reflects  improvement in the experience  rate as well as the payment of termite
claims and the cost of remediation  accrued insurance decreased 63 million or
129 during the year as a result of improved  experience rate  attributable to
the companys proactive management of issues associated with self insured risks

critical accounting policies

     we view  critical  accounting  policies to be those  policies that are very
important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations
and that require managements most difficult  complex or subjective  judgments
the circumstances  that make these judgments  difficult or complex relate to the
need for  management  to make  estimates  about the effect of  matters  that are
inherently  uncertain  we believe  our  critical  accounting  policies to be as
follows

     accrual  for  termite  contracts   the  company  maintains  an accrual for
     termite  contracts  representing  the  estimated  costs of  reapplications
     repair claims and associated labor chemicals  and other costs relative to
     termite  control  services  performed  prior to the balance sheet date the
     company  contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to
     provide the company a range of estimated  liability  based upon  historical
     claims  information  the  actuarial  study  is a  major  consideration  in
     determining  the  accrual  balance  along with  managements  knowledge  of
     changes in business practices contract changes ongoing claims and termite
     remediation  trends the reserve is established based on all these factors
     management  makes  judgments   utilizing  these  operational   factors  but
     recognizes  that they are  inherently  subjective  due to the difficulty in
     predicting  settlements  and awards  other  factors that may impact future
     cost include  chemical life expectancy and governmental  regulation  it is
     significant  that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years
     due to changes in the  companys  business  practices  however  it is not
     possible to accurately predict future significant claims  positive changes
     to our business  practices  include  revisions made to our contracts  more
     effective treatment methods that include a directedliquid baiting program
     more effective termiticides and expanded training methods and techniques

     accrued  insurance   the company  selfinsures  up to  specified  limits
     certain  risks  related to general  liability  workers  compensation  and
     vehicle liability  the estimated costs of existing and future claims under
     the  selfinsurance  program are accrued  based upon  historical  trends as
     incidents occur whether reported or unreported although actual settlement
     of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently
     revised  based  on  developments  relating  to  such  claims  the  company
     contracts an independent  third party actuary on an annual basis to provide
     the company a range of estimated  liability  based upon  historical  claims
     information  the  actuarial  study is a major  consideration  along  with
     managements  knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims
     compared to current balances the reserve is established based on all these
     factors  managements  judgment is inherently  subjective  and a number of
     factors are  outside  managements  knowledge  and  control  additionally
     historical  information  is not  always an  accurate  indication  of future
     events  it should be noted that the  number of claims has been  decreasing
     due to the  companys  proactive  risk  management  to develop and maintain
     ongoing programs  however it is not possible to accurately predict future
     significant  claims  initiatives  that  have  been  implemented   include
     preemployment  and an annual  motor  vehicle  report  required  on all its
     drivers  utilization  of a global  positioning  system that has been fully
     deployed to our company vehicles  postoffer  physicals for new employees
     and  prehire  random and  postaccident  drug  testing  the  company has
     improved  the time  required  to report a claim by  utilizing a red alert
     program that provides serious accident  assessment  twenty four hours a day
     and seven days a week and has  instituted  a  modified  duty  program  that
     enables employees to go back to work on a limitedduty basis

     revenue  recognition   the  companys  revenue  recognition  policies  are
     designed to  recognize  revenues at the time  services are  performed  for
     certain revenue types  because of the timing of billing and the receipt of
     cash versus the timing of performing services certain accounting estimates
     are  utilized   residential  and  commercial  pest  control  services  are
     primarily recurring in nature  while certain types of commercial customers
     may receive  multiple  treatments  within a given month  in general  pest
     control  customers  sign an initial one year  contract  and  revenues  are
     recognized at the time services are performed  for pest control customers
     the company  offers a discount  for those  customers  who prepay for a full
     year of services  the company defers recognition of these advance payments
     and  recognizes  the  revenue as the  services  are  rendered  the company
     classifies the discounts  related to the advance payments as a reduction in
     revenues termite baiting revenues are recognized when the initial services
     are  performed at the  inception of a new  contract  although a portion of
     every termite baiting sale is deferred  the amount deferred is an estimate
     of the value of  monitoring  services  to be  rendered  after  the  initial
     service   the  amount   deferred  is  then   recognized  as  income  on  a
     straightline  basis over the  remaining  contract  term  which results in
     recognition  of  revenue  in a  pattern  that  approximates  the  timing of
     performing monitoring visits  baiting renewals are deferred and recognized
     over the annual contract period on a straightline  basis that approximates
     the  timing of  performing  the  required  monitoring  visits  traditional
     termite  treatments  are  recognized  as revenue at the time  services  are
     performed traditional termite contract renewals are recognized as revenues
     at the  renewal  date in order to match the  revenue  with the  approximate
     timing of the corresponding service provided

liquidity and capital resources

     the company  believes  its current  cash  balances  future cash flows from
operating  activities and available  borrowings  under its 400 million line of
credit will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations and
fund  expansion  of the  business  for the  foreseeable  future  the  companys
operations generated cash of 537 million for the year ended december 31 2002
compared with cash provided by operating activities of 296 million in 2001 and
114  million in 2000  the 2002 increase  resulted  primarily  from  favorable
changes  in  working  capital  related  primarily  to  higher  net  income  from
operations  the timing of advanced  payments from  customers  which produced an
increase in unearned revenue and the companys ability to reduce its investment
in accounts  receivable and inventories  despite higher revenues  a customer of

material impact on the companys results of operations or its liquidity

million as well as equipment  replacements and upgrades and improvements to the
companys management  information systems the company expects to invest between
85 million and 105 million in 2003 in capital expenditures during the year
the company made several  acquisitions  totaling  18 million  compared to 07
million during 2001 the company  currently does not have plans to  aggressively
seek new  acquisitions but will give  consideration to any unusually  attractive
acquisition  opportunities  presented  a total of 60 million was paid in cash
dividends 0033 a quarter during the year and approximately  62 million was
paid  for  repurchases  of  496200  shares  of  the  companys   common  stock
approximately 108000 of these repurchased shares were used for the 401k match
in february 2003 at the january 28 2003 board of directors  meeting the board
approved  a 50  increase  in the  dividend  from  0033 to 005 on the split

existing cash balances and operating  activities  the company maintains a 400
million  credit  facility with a commercial  bank  of which no borrowings  were
outstanding as of december 31 2002 or february 24 2003  however  the company
