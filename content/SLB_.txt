supporting the divisions is a global network of research and engineering centers through these centers schlumberger advances its technology programs to safely and sustainably enhance industry efficiency lower finding and producing costs improve productivity maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value

the divisions are deployed around a geographical structure within five basins americas land offshore atlantic middle east  north africa asia and russia  central asia the basins are configured around common regional characteristics to deploy fitforpurpose technologies operating models and skills and are focused on agility responsiveness and competitiveness the basins are comprised of geounits which can be a single country or made up of several countries with a strong focus on the customers basins identify opportunities for local growth

corporate strategy

schlumberger’s strategy is designed to adapt the company to an evolving industry landscape shaped by emerging drivers including capital discipline regionalization of supply and demand an efficiency imperative and resilience—defined by sustainability and lower carbon footprint this strategy is designed to magnify schlumberger’s ability to improve customer performance which is the differentiating factor that will help our industry meet higher stakeholder expectations 

oil and gas will remain critical to economic activity and prosperity according to the most recent international energy agency sustainable development scenario oil and gas are expected to represent approximately 45 of the global energy mix through 2040 schlumberger’s role is twofold to enable customers to produce these resources efficiently cost effectively and with the lowest carbon footprint and to support the world’s transition to a more diversified energy mix

schlumberger’s strategy is structured around three major themes all of which are focused on customer performance i strengthen the core ii gotomarket and iii horizons of growth

strengthen the core

the core of schlumberger is how we work with customers and execute our business the elements in this theme—which include customer collaboration the integrity and efficiency of our operations and capital stewardship—are enabled by our people and technology 

as a service company schlumberger has always worked closely with customers we are exploring new ways to collaborate and help them overcome their challenges and improve performance

operations integrity and efficiency—core to schlumberger’s culture—are enhanced by the digitization of our operations just as schlumberger is delivering digital solutions to our customers we are advancing them in our own operations to capture value from our equipment and services businesses by integrating them into our digital structure

capital stewardship is a crucial factor for our industry schlumberger has implemented a capital allocation framework that governs all investments whether related to capital expenditures mergers and acquisitions or research and engineering the underlying principle behind this framework is that investment opportunities are prioritized based on returns and cash flow our focus on capital stewardship also includes evolving certain businesses into innovative less capitalintensive commercial models

gotomarket

industry markets have evolved into multiple diverse regional markets that are increasingly competing with each other to meet global regional and domestic oil and gas demand each of these regions has a set of resource plays—or basins—with localized economics and operational drivers as a result the industry is witnessing a decoupling of the activity characteristics of each major region resulting in a unique set of dynamics for each oil and gas basin across the world this presents schlumberger with opportunities that can be optimally addressed with a basinspecific approach

 

a key differentiator for schlumberger is its “fitforbasin” approach and ability fitforbasin describes the mindset schlumberger has adopted toward technology development incountry value and market access schlumberger is developing and deploying basinspecific technology that helps its customers overcome the challenges of their respective regions at the same time incountry value enables regional efficiency and performance while creating opportunity and aligning with the strategic priorities of our clients 

in addition technology access and performance models are highly strategic elements of our gotomarket strategy technology access is fundamentally about making the right decisions with respect to our technology portfolio and how we go to market performance models are focused on commercial and contractual innovations 

the elements of our gotomarket strategy enable schlumberger to develop deeper partnerships with customers expanding on their needs and challenges from a basinspecific perspective to provide technology and business models tailored to regional or individual customer requirements these elements allow us to share in the performance improvement we deliver for customers and partners

horizons of growth

the third strategic element positions schlumberger to increase its share in existing markets and expand into new longterm markets in digital production and recovery and energy transition including schlumberger new energy and transition technologies 

digital capabilities are crucial to longterm performance and resilience through its industryleading digital platform schlumberger will enable digital transformation at scale unlocking significant value and leading innovation across the digital domain in the industry

schlumberger seeks to define the future of digital technology in the energy industry and has designed and built a secure and flexible digital industry platform centered around differentiated digital technologies enabled by key partnerships with companies such as google ibm microsoft amazon web services aveva and nov schlumberger provides an open digital platform that takes advantage of ondemand highperformance computing and makes digital capabilities such as embedded artificial intelligence or machine learning readily accessible to customers 

the application of digital technology across the entire ep value chain—from subsurface to drilling to production—has the potential to deliver a stepchange in operational workflows that will significantly elevate our customers’ performance sustainably digital technology can move technical workflows from the desktop to the cloud creating data structures that enable artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide insights at scale across our customers’ operations 

production and recovery is about positioning schlumberger to take advantage of two key trends shaping the market the first trend relates to accelerating gas discovery development and production as schlumberger expects to see significant growth in gas demand over the next two decades as the world seeks to decarbonize its energy mix the second trend relates to operators’ increased focus on improving recovery from their existing wells fields and infrastructure—ultimately achieving the most capital efficient production as a result and based on our deep domain knowledge from the subsurface to midstream production facilities we are positioning our technology portfolio to participate and lead in these growing markets

finally schlumberger recognizes that its future will expand beyond oil and gas with energy transition and the company is positioning itself for longterm growth opportunities in this regard in 2020 the company created schlumberger new energy to develop businesses in lowcarbon or carbonneutral energy technologies and in 2021 it announced its commitment to reach netzero emissions by 2050 and launched its transition technologies portfolio to reduce emissions from oil and gas operations 

schlumberger new energy is using partnership models and schlumberger’s experience in technology industrialization to expand into energy verticals beyond oil and gas schlumberger’s approach is to apply its domain expertise in areas adjacent to its existing activities where it can use its global footprint and execution platform to deliver at scale

the schlumberger new energy portfolio consists of ventures in the domains of hydrogen lithium energy storage carbon capture and sequestration “ccs” geothermal power and geoenergy for heating and cooling buildings while many of these investments are in new energy emerging sectors schlumberger new energy has leveraged schlumberger’s extensive experience in both the ccs and geothermal sectors for more than two decades schlumberger has participated in ccs projects providing consulting technology services and project management in geothermal schlumberger provides the full spectrum of geothermal resource development services through geothermex a consulting and services company we acquired in 2010 schlumberger new energy has extended schlumberger’s geothermal reach by exploring opportunities in the development of geothermal power projects

 

schlumberger new energy activities currently include the following ventures and strategic partnerships 

 











in june 2021 schlumberger announced its commitment to achieve netzero greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions by 2050 guided by climate science and ghg protocol schlumberger spent 18 months conducting extensive analysis and working with experts to produce its decarbonization plan which is aligned with the paris agreement ambition of limiting global warming to 15 degrees celsius schlumberger was the first energy services company to set a netzero target inclusive of all three emission scopes by setting targets with respect to the company’s total 2019 baseline ghg footprint of approximately 54 million metric tons of co 2 equivalent which consisted of 52 million metric tons of scope 3 emissions and two million metric tons of scope 1 and scope 2 emissions and not just its scope 1 and 2 footprint schlumberger’s comprehensive emissions reduction roadmap addresses the entire oil and gas value chain 

schlumberger’s 2050 net zero target is supported by the following interim milestones using 2019 as the baseline year

 







there are three key components to schlumberger achieving its netzero target reducing operational emissions reducing customer emissions that occur while using schlumberger technology and taking carbonnegative actions of sufficient scale to offset any residual operational and technology emissions that the company may have in 2050 

schlumberger’s scope 1 and 2 emissions primarily come from its fuel use and electricity consumption whereas its scope 3 emissions are indirect such as customer emissions related to the use of schlumberger technology and operational emissions related to purchased goods and services in 2021 schlumberger launched its transition technologies portfolio this portfolio is focused on addressing fugitive emissions flaring reduction electrification well construction emissions and full field development solutions comprised of proprietary technologies and solutions the transition technologies portfolio will help reduce direct and indirect emissions along with other environmental attributes while simultaneously driving efficiency reliability and performance for our customers

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors known to us contains important information for the understanding of our “forwardlooking statements” which are discussed immediately following item 7a of this form 10k and elsewhere these risk factors should also be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k 

we urge you to consider carefully the risks described below which discuss the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects 

business and operational risks 

demand for our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers recent oil and gas industry downturns have resulted in reduced demand for oilfield products and services and lower expenditures by our customers which has in the past had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

demand for our products and services depends substantially on expenditures by our customers for the exploration development and production of oil and gas reserves these expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ views of future demand for oil and gas and future oil and gas prices as well as our customers’ ability to access capital in addition the transition of the global energy sector from primarily a fossil fuelbased system to renewable energy sources could affect our customers’ levels of expenditures 

actual and anticipated declines in oil and gas prices have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in lower capital expenditures project modifications delays or cancellations general business disruptions and delays in payment of or nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us these effects have had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

historically oil and gas prices have experienced significant volatility and can be affected by a variety of factors including 

























the oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns which have been characterized by diminished demand for our products and services and downward pressure on the prices that we are able to charge sustained market uncertainty can also result in lower demand and pricing for our products and services a significant industry downturn sustained market uncertainty or increased availability of economical alternative energy sources could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects 

disruptions in the political regulatory economic and social environments of the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we generate revenue in more than 120 countries across the world our nonus operations accounted for approximately 85 of our consolidated revenue in 2021 81 in 2020 and 72 in 2019 instability and unforeseen changes in any of the markets in which we operate could result in business disruptions that may have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and services or our financial condition results of operations or cash flows these factors include but are not limited to the following



 

 

























failure to effectively and timely address the energy transition could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows

our longterm success depends on our ability to effectively address the energy transition which will require adapting our technology portfolio to potentially changing government requirements and customer preferences as well as engaging with our customers to develop solutions to decarbonize oil and gas operations if the energy transition landscape changes faster than anticipated or in a manner that we do not anticipate demand for our products and services could be adversely affected furthermore if we fail or are perceived to not effectively implement an energy transition strategy or if investors or financial institutions shift funding away from companies in fossil fuelrelated industries our access to capital or the market for our securities could be negatively impacted 

we operate in a highly competitive environment if we are unable to maintain technology leadership this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold 

the energy industry is highly competitive our business may be adversely affected if we fail to continue developing and producing innovative technologies in response to changes in the market including customer and government requirements or if we fail to deliver such technologies to our customers in a timely and costcompetitive manner if we are unable to maintain technology leadership in our industry our ability to maintain market share defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers could be adversely affected furthermore if competing technology accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services the value of our intellectual property may be reduced which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

limitations on our ability to obtain maintain protect or enforce our intellectual property rights including our trade secrets could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold 

there can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain maintain protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be adequate some of our products or services and the processes we use to produce or provide them have been granted patent protection have patent applications pending or are trade secrets our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected patent protection on some types of technology such as software or machine learning processes may not be available in certain countries in which we operate our competitors may also be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

third parties may claim that we have infringed upon or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services and products may infringe upon or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis regardless of the merits any such claims generally result in significant legal and other costs including reputational harm and may distract management from running our business resolving such claims could increase our costs including through royalty payments to acquire licenses if available from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies if a license to resolve a claim were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

legal and regulatory risks 

our operations require us to comply with numerous laws and regulations violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

our operations are subject to international regional national and local laws and regulations in every place where we operate relating to matters such as environmental protection health and safety labor and employment importexport controls currency exchange bribery and corruption data privacy and cybersecurity intellectual property immigration and taxation these laws and regulations are complex frequently change and have tended to become more stringent over time in the event the scope of these laws and regulations expands in the future the incremental cost of compliance could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

our operations are subject to anticorruption and antibribery laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other similar laws we are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to and certain operations in various countries or with certain persons our ability to transfer people products and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations 

the internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of antibribery trade control trade sanctions or anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition violations of international and us laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition in addition any major violations could have a significant effect on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business and maintain existing customer and supplier relationships

existing or future laws regulations court orders or other initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions or relating to climate change may reduce demand for our products and services 

continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and proposed international agreements and national regional and local legislation and regulatory measures to limit ghg emissions the implementation of these agreements including the paris agreement the europe climate law and other existing or future regulatory mandates may adversely affect the demand for our products and services impose taxes on us or our customers require us or our customers to reduce ghg emissions from our technologies or operations or accelerate the obsolescence of our products or services

in addition increasing attention to the risks of climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of litigation or investigations brought by public and private entities against oil and gas companies in connection with their ghg emissions as a result we or our customers may become subject to court orders compelling a reduction of ghg emissions or requiring mitigation of the effects of climate change 

there is also increased focus by governments and our customers investors and other stakeholders on climate change sustainability and energy transition matters negative attitudes toward or perceptions of our industry or fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment have led governments nongovernmental organizations and companies to implement initiatives to conserve energy and promote the use of alternative energy sources which may reduce the demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus reduce future demand for our products and services in addition initiatives by investors and financial institutions to limit funding to companies in fossil fuelrelated industries may adversely affect our liquidity or access to capital any of these initiatives may in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including those governing air and ghg emissions water discharges and waste management as well as the importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials chemicals and explosives the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex stringent and expensive to implement these laws sometimes provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render us liable for damages without regard to our degree of care or fault some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances and as a result we could be liable for the actions of others 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation 

 

and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement or changing interpretations of existing laws and regulations the enactment of new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 

we could be subject to substantial liability claims including as a result of well incidents which could adversely affect our reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health safety and environmental risks our operations involve productionrelated activities radioactive materials chemicals explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration development and production environments accidents or acts of malfeasance involving these services or equipment or a failure of a product including as a result of a cyberattack could cause personal injury loss of life damage to or destruction of property equipment or the environment or suspension of operations which could materially adversely affect us any well incidents including blowouts at a well site or any loss of containment or well control may expose us to additional liabilities which could be material generally we rely on contractual indemnities releases and limitations on liability with our customers and insurance to protect us from potential liability related to such events however our insurance may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events including events involving pollution or against losses resulting from business interruption moreover we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

general risk factors 

the covid19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have had and may to continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic caused a significant and swift reduction in global economic activity during 2020 which significantly weakened demand for oil and gas and in turn for our products and services other effects of the pandemic included and may continue to include significant volatility and disruption of the global financial markets adverse revenue and net income effects disruptions to our operations including suspension or deferral of drilling activities  customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production downward revisions to customer budgets limitations on access to sources of liquidity supply chain disruptions limitations on access to raw materials employee impacts from illness school closures and other community response measures and temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers the pandemic is continuously evolving and the extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected will depend on various factors beyond our control such as the ultimate duration severity and sustained geographic resurgence of the virus the emergence of new variants and strains of the virus and the success of actions to contain the virus and its variants or treat its impact such as the availability and acceptance of vaccines covid19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic could also aggravate our other risk factors described in this form 10k 

our operations are subject to cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we are highly dependent on digital technologies and services to conduct our business we use these technologies for internal purposes including data storage processing and transmission as well as in our interactions with our business associates such as customers and suppliers in addition we develop software and other digital products and services that store retrieve manipulate and manage our customers’ information and data external data personal data and our own data our digital technologies and services and those of our business associates are subject to the risk of cyberattacks and given the nature of such attacks some incidents can remain undetected for a period of time despite efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect material consequences arising from such incidents or attacks or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur we have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal conduct of our business including attacks resulting from phishing emails and ransomware infections even if we successfully defend our own digital technologies and services we also rely on thirdparty business associates with whom we may share data and services to defend their digital technologies and services against attack 

we could suffer significant damage to our reputation if a cyber incident or attack were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers’ data other external data personal data or our own data or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted or if our digital products or services were reported to have or were perceived as having security vulnerabilities this could lead to fewer customers using our digital products and services which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition if our systems or our thirdparty business associates’ systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove to be insufficient we could be adversely affected by among other things loss of or damage to intellectual property proprietary or confidential information or customer supplier or employee data breach of personal data interruption of our business operations increased legal and regulatory exposure including fines and remediation costs and increased costs required to 

 

prevent respond to or mitigate cybersecurity attacks these risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with our employees business associates and other third parties and may result in claims against us the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our aspirations goals and initiatives related to sustainability and emissions reduction and our public statements and disclosures regarding them expose us to numerous risks

we have developed and will continue to develop and set goals targets and other objectives related to sustainability matters including our netzero target and our energy transition strategy statements related to these goals targets and objectives reflect our current plans and do not constitute a guarantee that they will be achieved our efforts to research establish accomplish and accurately report on these goals targets and objectives expose us to numerous operational reputational financial legal and other risks our ability to achieve any stated goal target or objective including with respect to emissions reduction is subject to numerous factors and conditions some of which are outside of our control 

our business may face increased scrutiny from investors and other stakeholders related to our sustainability activities including the goals targets and objectives that we announce and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them if our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards which continue to evolve our reputation our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively affected similarly our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainabilityfocused goals targets and objectives to comply with ethical environmental or other standards regulations or expectations or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters within the timelines we announce or at all could adversely affect our business or reputation as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation 

failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could impede our operations

our future success depends on our ability to recruit train and retain qualified personnel we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business competition for the personnel necessary for our businesses intensifies as activity increases and technology evolves in periods of high utilization it is often more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals this could increase our costs or have other material adverse effects on our operations

severe weather including extreme weather conditions associated with climate change has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations and financial results 

our business has been and in the future will be affected by severe weather in areas where we operate which could materially affect our operations and financial results extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes flooding and landslides have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in the evacuation of personnel stoppage of services and activity disruptions at our facilities in our supply chain or at wellsites or result in disruptions of our customers’ operations particularly severe weather events affecting platforms or structures may result in a suspension of activities in addition acute or chronic physical impacts of climate change such as sea level rise coastal storm surge inland flooding from intense rainfall and hurricanestrength winds may damage our facilities any such extreme weather events may result in increased operating costs or decreases in revenue which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

this section of the form 10k generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and yeartoyear comparisons between 2021 and 2020 discussions of 2019 items and yeartoyear comparison between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this form 10k can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of schlumberger’s annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020

2021 executive overview 

continuing a broad recovery that began in 2020 oil markets were generally positive throughout the year with brent oil price starting 2021 at the year’s low of 51 per barrel reaching a high of 85 in november sentiment in oil markets was largely positive as global demand recovered and supply was managed by a combination of the reassurance of continued intervention from opec and ongoing capital discipline by publicly traded operators in north america 

within the context of strengthening fundamentals across the year there were several instances where the potential impact of covid19 variants raised concerns regarding demand growth however these periods were shorter lived than the prolonged decline in 2020 which was characterized by economic lockdowns and oil prices soon rebounded pricing was initially supported by opec production agreements that had come into effect in 2020 and remained resilient as those production targets were gradually increased in the second half of 2021 as crude and product stocks continued a multiyear downward trend 

international activity grew broadly across geographies in the second half of the year including offshore and deepwater with operators investing in projects to meet longterm objectives and regional demand growth

activity in north america land also rebounded albeit from a very low base in 2020 but did not return to prepandemic levels as investment and production were subdued as a result of continued capital discipline on the part of larger producers

international natural gas pricing while following the traditional seasonal pattern was volatile swinging from pandemicdriven lows in 2020 to record highs around the world domestically us henry hub natural gas prices rose dramatically averaging 391 per million british thermal units on a monthly basis—as compared to 204 in 2020—and reaching a peak of 587 in october before ending the year at 373 

against this backdrop schlumberger’s fullyear 2021 revenue of 229 billion decreased 3 yearonyear as a result of the divestitures of the onestim pressure pumping business and the north america lowflow artificial lift business during the fourth quarter of 2020 these divestitures were consistent with schlumberger’s strategy to focus on expanding margins minimizing earnings volatility and focusing on less capitalintensive businesses by highgrading and rationalizing its business portfolio the divested businesses accounted for approximately 25 of schlumberger’s north america revenue in 2020 excluding the impact of these divestitures which generated 13 billion of revenue during 2020 all of which was in north america fullyear 2021 global revenue grew 3 yearonyear driven by an 8 increase in north america and a 2 increase in international revenue 

financial performance in 2021 was driven by global oil and gas activity growth in the second half of the year as investment spending experienced doubledigit growth yearonyear consequently schlumberger’s revenue in the second half of 2021 grew 12 compared to the same period of 2020 and increased 18 when adjusted for the effects of the divestitures international revenue increased 12 yearonyear during the second half of 2021 and north america revenue increased 10 or 44 when adjusted for the effects of the divestitures which generated 05 billion of revenue during the second half of 2020

looking ahead into 2022 we believe the industry macro fundamentals are very favorable due to the combination of projected steady demand recovery an increasingly tight supply market and supportive oil prices schlumberger expects this to result in a material step up in industry capital spending with doubledigit growth in both the international and north american markets absent any further significant covidrelated disruption oil demand is expected to exceed prepandemic levels before the end of the year and further strengthen in 2023 we believe these favorable market conditions are similar to those experienced during the last industry supercycle suggesting that resurgent global demandled capital spending will result in an exceptional multiyear growth cycle

throughout 2021 schlumberger continued to strengthen its core portfolio enhanced its sustainability leadership successfully advanced its digital journey and expanded its new energy portfolio schlumberger is well prepared to fully seize this growth ahead schlumberger is entering this cycle in a position of strength having reset its operating leverage expanded peerleading margins across multiple quarters and aligned its technology and business portfolio with the new industry imperatives

interest and other income 

interest  other income consisted of the following 

 



 

the decrease in earnings of equity method investments in 2021 as compared to 2020 is primarily attributable to schlumberger’s share of net losses associated with schlumberger’s investment in liberty schlumberger records its share of liberty’s net income or loss on a onequarter lag

during the fourth quarter of 2021 schlumberger sold 95 million of its shares of liberty and recognized a gain of 28 million see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements

other 

research  engineering and general  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  were as follows 

 



 

income taxes 

the schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases the schlumberger effective tax rate generally decreases conversely when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases the schlumberger effective tax rate generally increases 

the schlumberger effective tax rate was 19 in 2021 as compared to 7 in 2020 the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  these charges and credits reduced the effective tax rate in 2020 by 12 percentage points as a significant portion of these charges were not taxeffective

schlumberger recorded charges and credits during 2021 and 2020 these charges and credits which are summarized below are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  

the following is a summary of the 2021 charges and credits

details of the components of liquidity as well as changes in liquidity follow

 



 



 









 

 

 

key liquidity events during 2021 and 2020 included 





























as of december 31 2021 schlumberger had 314 billion of cash and shortterm investments and committed credit facility agreements with commercial banks aggregating 660 billion all of which was available and unused schlumberger believes these amounts along with cash generated by ongoing operations will be sufficient to meet future business requirements for the next 12 months and beyond

 

 

 

the following table reflects the carrying amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 2021 by year of maturity 

 



 

interest payments on fixed rate debt obligations by year are as follows

 



see note 13 leases of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger’s lease obligations

schlumberger has outstanding letters of creditguarantees that relate to business performance bonds customexcise tax commitments facility leaserental obligations etc these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain 

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices adjustments to the allowance may be required in future periods depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments

as a large multinational company with a long history of operating in a cyclical industry schlumberger has extensive experience in working with its customers during difficult times to manage its accounts receivable during weak economic environments or when there is an extended period of weakness in oil and gas prices schlumberger typically experiences delays in the payment of its receivables however except for a 469 million accounts receivable writeoff during 2017 as a result of the political and economic condition in venezuela schlumberger has not historically had material writeoffs due to uncollectible accounts receivable schlumberger generates revenue in more than 120 countries as of december 31 2021 five of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5 of schlumberger’s net accounts receivable balance of which only one the united states accounted for greater than 10 of such receivables

at times in recent periods schlumberger has experienced delays in payments from its primary customer in mexico included in receivables less allowance for doubtful accounts in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 30 2021 is approximately 05 billion of receivables relating to mexico at december 31 2021 07 billion at december 31 2020 schlumberger’s receivables from its primary customer in mexico are not in dispute and schlumberger has not historically had any material writeoffs due to uncollectible accounts receivable relating to this customer

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill the goodwill relating to each of schlumberger’s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred 

under generally accepted accounting principles schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount there is no need to perform any further testing however if schlumberger concludes otherwise then it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded based on that difference 

schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test 

schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test in 2021 based on this assessment schlumberger concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was significantly greater than its carrying amount accordingly no further testing was required

during 2020 and 2019 schlumberger recorded goodwill impairment charges of 31 billion and 88 billion and intangible asset impairment charges of 33 billion and 11 billion respectively refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for details regarding the facts and circumstances that led to this impairment and how the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated including the significant assumptions used and other details 

longlived assets including fixed assets intangible assets and investments in aps projects are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual 

 

disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 

income taxes 

schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts schlumberger recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes that will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are judgmental and are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities that could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

revenue recognition for certain longterm constructiontype contracts

schlumberger recognizes revenue for certain longterm constructiontype contracts over time these contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customerspecific applications under this method revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs approximately 6 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2021 and 5 in each of 2020 and 2019 respectively was recognized under this method

the estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims profits are recognized based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete due to the nature of these projects adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs are often required as work progresses any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable

pension and postretirement benefits 

schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements  the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate that schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of payment of the related benefit obligations the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans 









the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the average expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans was 660 in both 2021 and 2020 the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international pension plans was 673 in 2021 and 671 in 2020 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

 

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for schlumberger’s united states and international pension plan s

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger generates revenue in more than 120 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar approximately 70 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2021 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will increase 

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on its earnings schlumberger enters into foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities and certain expenses denominated in currencies other than the functional currency

a 10 appreciation in the us dollar from the december 31 2021 market rates would increase the unrealized value of schlumberger’s forward contracts by 5 million conversely a 10 depreciation in the us dollar from the december 31 2021 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of schlumberger’s forward contracts by 8 million in either scenario the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future earnings

at december 31 2021 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 77 billion in various foreign currencies of which 60 billion related to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency

the new organization consists of four divisions that combine and integrate schlumberger’s technologies enhancing the portfolio of capabilities that support the emerging longterm growth opportunities in each of these market segments

the four divisions are

supporting the divisions is a global network of research and engineering centers through which schlumberger advances its technology programs to enhance industry efficiency and sustainability lower finding and producing costs improve productivity maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value while accomplishing these goals safely

the divisions are deployed around a geographical structure of five basins americas land offshore atlantic middle east and north africa asia and russia and central asia the basins are a collection of geounits which consist of a single country to several countries that each have common themes in terms of strategy economic and operational drivers and technology needs with a strong focus on the customer and growth the basins are responsible for defining a basin strategy in line with schlumberger’s corporate strategy and identifying opportunities for future growth

corporate strategy

schlumberger’s ambition is to be its customers’ “performance partner” of choice by putting the customer at the center of everything it does and by being the company that defines performance in the energy services industry schlumberger’s strategy is structured around three major themes i strengthen the core ii expand the gotomarket and iii next horizons of growth

strengthen the core

strengthening the core is focused on developing our people collaborating with our customers and enhancing our technology performance to enable schlumberger’s vision of customer performance maintaining capital discipline is also a key element of strengthening the core—such as evaluating all investment decisions through the lens of return on capital rather than growth and evolving certain businesses into innovative models that are less capital intensive

expand the gotomarket

schlumberger believes that a key shift in the industry is the greater prominence and interplay of regional or basinspecific supply and demand the industry is witnessing a decoupling of the activity characteristics of each major region resulting in a unique set of dynamics for each oil and gas basin across the world 

there are four main regions increasingly competing against each other for market access to meet global regional and domestic energy demand north america land middle east russia and central asia and offshore these regions correspond to a different set of resource plays or basins each facing different economic and operational drivers which translates into different activity levels and cycles current geopolitical uncertainties and trade conflicts will only amplify this trend resulting in the transition from a global market toward a more localized supply and demand dynamic

 

as basins around the world decouple a key differentiator for schlumberger will be its “fitforbasin” approach and ability basins have significantly different dynamics including technological needs incountry value and market or technology access schlumberger is developing and deploying basinspecific technology that helps its customers overcome the challenges of their respective regions incountry value enables regional efficiency and performance while increasing local content and aligning with the strategic priorities of our clients  

additionally by employing different business models schlumberger will evolve the way it goes to market in certain regions schlumberger will seek to monetize its technology advantage by deploying alternative operating models such as selling or leasing selected technologies to regional service providers with a license to operate in these specific markets schlumberger expects this approach to expand its total addressable market

next horizons of growth

schlumberger’s history and culture have been based on leadership science and innovation since its founders invented wireline logging as a technique for obtaining downhole data in oil and gas wells continuing this tradition schlumberger will focus its future growth in two areas digital innovation and new energy 

schlumberger seeks to define the future of digital technology in the energy industry the application of digital technology in field operations has the potential to deliver a stepchange in operational workflows to significantly elevate performance to take the next step in performance that our customers need to deliver energy in today’s competitive environment schlumberger is developing and using digital solutions focused on generating richer data and better insights that will achieve performance not previously possible across the energy industry 

schlumberger is leveraging its portfolio of proprietary digital technologies as well as technologies that have transformed other industries to enable our customers to make better and faster decisions integrating digital technology into exploration and production “ep” workflows requires extensive domain expertise in upstream hardware and software technologies and in the management and interpretation of vast amounts of subsurface and production data schlumberger will continue to lead the digital transformation of the energy industry by applying its unique data and digital expertise to every facet of the ep life cycle

through its new energy portfolio schlumberger is investing in low carbon and carbonneutral energy technologies that will provide a platform for future sustainable growth schlumberger recognizes that its future will expand beyond oil and gas with the energy transition and consequently the company is positioning for significant growth opportunities for the long term schlumberger new energy is taking a business venture approach that will focus on energy efficiency and energy storage as a priority aimed at developing unique positions in adjacent markets and introducing breakthrough technologies in energy verticals beyond oil and gas schlumberger will utilize its domain expertise in areas adjacent to its existing activities where it can deliver at scale with its global footprint and execution platform

schlumberger recognizes that its ability to attract develop motivate and retain a highly competent and diverse workforce has been key to its success for many decades as a service company schlumberger believes it is critical for its people to communicate with its customers in their native languages and to share the values of the people in the countries where it works furthermore schlumberger’s diverse workforce is better able to respond to and deliver services and products that meet the unique expectations and requirements of its stakeholders including customers suppliers and stockholders schlumberger’s longstanding commitment to national and cultural diversity fosters a culture that is global in outlook yet local in practice which permeates every layer of the company

in addition to national and cultural diversity achieving improved gender balance has been a focus of policy and action in schlumberger since the late 1970s when it began recruiting women for field operations roles since then schlumberger has continued to expand opportunities for women across its field operations technology business and management roles schlumberger believes that these gender diversity initiatives help it maintain its competitive advantage

schlumberger set its first gender balance target in 1994 with the goal of having women comprise 15 of its salaried workforce by 2015 this goal was achieved ahead of schedule in 2011 schlumberger’s current gender balance goal is to have women comprise 25 of the company’s salaried workforce by 2025 in 2020 women made up approximately 23 of the company’s salaried employee population additionally approximately 21 of management roles were held by women in 2020

schlumberger is proud of its meritocratic culture its commitment to early responsibility and internal promotion and its “borderless career” philosophy schlumberger strives to identify top talent within the company and to provide opportunities for employees who demonstrate exceptional competency and performance to progress to higher levels within the organization schlumberger seeks to nurture its talent pool to maximize each employee’s developmental potential through a combination of training and experience schlumberger’s “borderless career” philosophy means it supports flexible career paths helping employees develop their skills across different functions businesses and geographies these opportunities accelerate career development while fostering an agile workforce and the next generation of business leaders

 item 1a ris k factors 

the following discussion of risk factors known to us contains important information for the understanding of our “forwardlooking statements” which are discussed immediately following item 7a of this form 10k and elsewhere these risk factors should also be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k 

we urge you to consider carefully the risks described below which discuss the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects 

business and operational risks 

demand for our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers the current significant oil and gas industry downturn has resulted in reduced demand for oilfield services and lower expenditures by our customers which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for our products and services depends substantially on expenditures by our customers for the exploration development and production of oil and natural gas reserves these expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ views of future oil and natural gas prices as well as their ability to access capital these expenditures are also sensitive to our customers’ views of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas 

the continued low oil and gas prices have also caused a reduction in cash flows for our customers which has had a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of some of our customers this has resulted in and may continue to result in lower capital expenditures project modifications delays or cancellations general business disruptions and delays in payment of or nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us these effects have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

historically oil and natural gas prices have experienced significant volatility and can be affected by a variety of factors including 































 

the oil and gas industry has historically been extremely cyclical however there can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas or for our products and services will follow historic patterns or recover meaningfully in the near or medium term continued or worsening conditions in the oil and gas industry generally may have a further material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly reduced demand for our services and has had and is likely to continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the effects of the covid19 pandemic including actions taken by businesses and governments to contain the spread of the virus have resulted in a significant and swift reduction in international and us economic activity in our industry geopolitical events that increased the supply of lowpriced oil to the global market occurred at the same time that demand weakened due to the worldwide effects of the pandemic leading to a collapse in oil prices in march 2020 these events together adversely affected the demand for oil and natural gas as well as for our services and products and caused significant volatility and disruption of the global financial markets other effects of the pandemic have included and may continue to include adverse revenue and net income effects disruptions to our operations including suspension or deferral of drilling activities  customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production downward revisions to customer budgets limitations on access to sources of liquidity employee impacts from illness school closures and other community response measures workforce reductions in response to activity declines and temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers this period of extreme economic disruption low oil prices and reduced demand for our products and services has had and is likely to continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected by the covid19 pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control such as the duration and scope of the pandemic additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus including vaccine development and distribution covid19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic could also aggravate our other risk factors described in this form 10k 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonus operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in the more than 120 countries in which we generate revenue 

our nonus operations accounted for approximately 81 of our consolidated revenue in 2020 72 in 2019 and 68 in 2018 in addition to the risks addressed elsewhere in this section our operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 





























 

severe weather including extreme weather conditions associated with climate change has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations and financial results 

our business has been and in the future will be affected by severe weather in areas where we operate which could materially affect our operations and financial results extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes flooding and landslides have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in the evacuation of personnel stoppage of services and activity disruptions at our facilities in our supply chain or at wellsites particularly severe weather events affecting platforms or structures may result in a suspension of activities in addition impacts of climate change such as sea level rise coastal storm surge inland flooding from intense rainfall and hurricanestrength winds may damage our facilities any such extreme weatherrelated events may result in increased operating costs or decreases in revenue which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

legal and regulatory risks 

our operations require us to comply with numerous laws and regulations violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition or cash flows

our operations are subject to international regional national and local laws and regulations in every place where we operate relating to matters such as environmental protection health and safety labor and employment importexport controls currency exchange bribery and corruption data privacy and cybersecurity intellectual property immigration and taxation these laws and regulations are complex frequently change and have tended to become more stringent over time in the event the scope of these laws and regulations expands in the future the incremental cost of compliance could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

our international operations are subject to anticorruption and antibribery laws and regulations such as the fcpa the uk bribery act and other similar laws we are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to and certain operations in various countries or with certain persons our ability to transfer people products and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations 

the internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of antibribery trade control trade sanctions or anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition violations of international and us laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition in addition any major violations could have a significant effect on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business and maintain existing customer and supplier relationships

demand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation regulations and public sentiment 

regulatory agencies and environmental advocacy groups in the european union the united states and other regions or countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases and their role in climate change there is also increased focus including by governments and our customers investors and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability and energy transition matters existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change as well as initiatives by governments nongovernmental organizations and companies to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources and negative attitudes toward or perceptions of fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment may significantly curtail demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus reduce future demand for our products and services this may in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows our business reputation and demand for our stock could be negatively affected if we do not or are perceived to not act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including those governing air emissions water discharges and waste management as well as the importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials chemicals and explosives we incur and expect to continue to incur significant capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex stringent and expensive to implement these laws sometimes provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render us liable for damages without regard to our degree of care or fault some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances and as a result we could be liable for the actions of others 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation 

 

and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement or changing interpretations of existing laws and regulations the enactment of new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 

we could be subject to substantial liability claims including well incidents which could adversely affect our reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health safety and environmental risks our operations involve productionrelated activities radioactive materials chemicals explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration development and production environments accidents or acts of malfeasance involving these services or equipment or a failure of a product including as a result of a cyberattack could cause personal injury loss of life damage to or destruction of property equipment or the environment or suspension of operations which could materially adversely affect us any well incidents including blowouts at a well site may expose us to additional liabilities which could be material generally we rely on contractual indemnities releases and limitations on liability with our customers and insurance to protect us from potential liability related to such events however our insurance may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events including events involving pollution or against losses resulting from business interruption moreover we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

intellectual property and technology risks 

if we are unable to maintain technology leadership this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold 

the oilfield services industry is highly competitive our business may be adversely affected if we fail to continue to develop and produce competitive technologies in response to changes in the market customer requirements and technology trends including trends in favor of emissionsreducing technologies or if we fail to deliver such technologies to our customers in a timely and costcompetitive manner in the various markets we serve if we are unable to maintain technology leadership in our industry our ability to maintain market share defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers could be adversely affected furthermore if our equipment or proprietary technologies become obsolete the value of our intellectual property may be reduced which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

limitations on our ability to obtain maintain protect or enforce our intellectual property rights including our trade secrets could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold 

there can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain maintain protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be adequate some of our products or services and the processes we use to produce or provide them have been granted patent protection have patent applications pending or are trade secrets our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected patent protection on some types of technology such as software or machine learning processes may not be available in certain countries in which we operate our competitors may also be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

third parties may claim that we have infringed upon misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services and products may infringe upon misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis regardless of the merits any such claims generally result in significant legal and other costs including reputational harm and may distract management from running our business resolving such claims could increase our costs including through royalty payments to acquire licenses if available from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies if a license to resolve a claim were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations 

we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases and technology evolves in periods of high utilization it is often more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals this could increase our costs or have other material adverse effects on our operations 

 

our operations are subject to cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are increasingly dependent on digital technologies and services to conduct our business we use these technologies for internal purposes including data storage processing and transmissions as well as in our interactions with our business associates such as customers and suppliers in addition we develop software and other digital products and services that store retrieve manipulate and manage our customers’ information and data external data and our own data our digital technologies and services and those of our business associates are subject to the risk of cyberattacks and given the nature of such attacks some incidents can remain undetected for a period of time despite efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect material consequences arising from such incidents or attacks or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur we have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal conduct of our business including attacks resulting from phishing emails and ransomware infections even if we successfully defend our own digital technologies and services we also rely on thirdparty business associates with whom we may share data and services to defend their digital technologies and services against attack

we could suffer significant damage to our reputation if a cyber incident or attack were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers’ data other external data or our own data or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted or if our digital products or services were reported to have or were perceived as having security vulnerabilities this could lead to fewer customers using our digital products and services which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in addition if our systems or our thirdparty business associates’ systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove to be insufficient we could be adversely affected by among other things loss of or damage to intellectual property proprietary or confidential information or customer supplier or employee data interruption of our business operations increased legal and regulatory exposure and costs and increased costs required to prevent respond to or mitigate cybersecurity attacks these risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with our employees business associates and other third parties and may result in claims against us the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements including without limitation statements relating to our plans strategies objectives expectations intentions and resources such forwardlooking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under “item 1a risk factors” of this form 10k 

2020 executive overview 

global demand for oil dropped precipitously from january through april of 2020 in parallel with the expansion of the covid19 coronavirus outbreak as governments around the world responded with lockdowns and travel decreased significantly global stocks of crude and refined products increased as oil supply could not respond quickly enough to balance the market 

as a result brent crude oil experienced its highest price of the year—70 per barrel—in january with a low of 9 per barrel in midapril collaboration between opec and nonopec suppliers including russia led to extraordinary supply intervention resulting in the removal of more than eight million barrels per day “bbld” of oil supply from the markets between april and june this eased pressure on oil storage capacity and allowed the brent price to stabilize in the 40 range until gaining strength in december where it closed at 52 per barrel

the opecled supply alliance maintained production within an agreed quota and helped to maintain a relatively stable oil price despite oil demand in the second half of 2020 being more than five million bbld lower than same period of 2019 demand for refined products other than jet fuel returned to within two million bbld of precrisis levels by end of 2020 

oil price volatility in the first half of the year compounded by uncertainty over the pace of covid19 recovery caused producers to lay down more than 40 of the world’s drilling rigs in just six months this suggests that 40 oil is insufficient to stimulate meaningful drilling activity growth however even with massive demand reduction the drilling activity necessary to maintain supply is still significant

in the us operators laid down nearly 70 of active rigs between the first and third quarters of 2020 before adding a modest number of rigs in the fourth quarter as a result us crude production fell by nearly two million bbld by the end of 2020 however the remaining rigs continued to drill in the highest quality reservoirs which resulted in supply remaining flat over the second half of the year

though global gas demand also suffered in response to the pandemic’s effect on economic activity its use for power generation heating and as a chemical feedstock made it more resilient than oil demand as the pandemic spread gas demand for 2020 was down only approximately 5 as compared to 2019

us henry hub natural gas price averaged 203 per million british thermal units “mmbtu” for the year having also fallen in the first half of 2020 prices recovered in the second half on decreased tightoil associated production in line with the reduction of active rigs international gas hub prices were more volatile 

against this backdrop schlumberger’s fullyear 2020 revenue of 236 billion declined 28 yearonyear north american revenue fell sharply by 48 to 55 billion this decrease was largely driven by weakness in the land market as operators reacted to oversupplied markets by making deep cuts to activity north america operators dropped drilling and pressure pumping activity quickly in the first quarter due to the effects of the pandemic on demand adding a modest volume of completion activity toward the end of the year international revenue was more resilient declining only 19 yearonyear this decline was most prominent in latin america europe and africa due to downward revisions to customer budgets and covid19 disruptions 

additionally during the fourth quarter of 2020 schlumberger completed two transactions the contribution of its onestim business in north america to liberty oilfield services “liberty” in exchange for a 37 stake in liberty and the divestiture of the north america lowflow rodlift business in a cash transaction these businesses accounted for approximately 25 of schlumberger’s north america revenue in 2020 consequently the percentage of schlumberger’s revenue that it generates in the international markets will increase significantly going forward the combination of schlumberger’s fitforbasin strategy digital technology innovation and scale puts the company in the best position to leverage the anticipated shift of spending growth toward the international markets

from a macro perspective oil prices have risen buoyed by recent supplyled opec policy the ongoing covid19 vaccine rollout and multinational economic stimulus actions—driving optimism for a meaningful oil demand recovery throughout 2021 we believe that this sets the stage for oil demand to recover to 2019 levels no later than 2023 or earlier as per recent industry analysts’ reports reinforcing a multiyear cycle recovery as the global economy strengthens absent a change to these macro assumptions this will translate into meaningful activity increases both in north america and internationally

in north america spending and activity momentum is expected to continue in the first half of 2021 towards maintenance levels albeit moderated by capital discipline and industry consolidation internationally following the seasonal effects of the first quarter of 2021 and as opec responds to strengthening oil demand higher spending is expected from the second quarter onwards accelerated 

 

activity is not expected to extend beyond the shortcycle markets and will be broad including offshore as witnessed during the fourth quarter 

the quality of schlumberger’s results in the fourth quarter of 2020 validates the progress of our performance strategy and the reinvention of schlumberger in this new chapter for the industry building from the swift execution and scale of our costout program we exited the year with quarterly margins reset to 2019 levels as the upcycle begins leveraging our highgraded and restructured business portfolio we see a clear path to achieve doubledigit margins in north america and visible international margin improvement in 2021 given the depth diversity and executional capability of our international business we believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit as international spending accelerates in the near and midterm 

by leveraging our new structure schlumberger is fully prepared to capitalize on the growth drivers of the future of our industry particularly as we accelerate our digital growth ambition and lead in the production and recovery market finally to meet our longterm ambition to bring lower carbon and carbonneutral energy sources and technology to market we are visibly expanding our new energy portfolio to contribute to the transformation of a more resilient sustainable and investable energy services industry

fullyear 2020 revenue of  236 billion decreased 28  yearonyear  north america revenue declined 48  yearonyear reflecting the continued capital discipline of north america operators who reduced drilling and hydraulic frac turing activity due to the pandemic  international revenue decreased 19  yearonyear due to covid19related disruptions the drop in offshore activity and reduced customer discretionary spending 

digital  integration

fullyear 2020 revenue of 31 billion decreased 26 yearonyear primarily due to lower multiclient and software sales as customers reduced activity due to covid19 and cut discretionary spending

yearonyear pretax operating margin increased 249 bps to 24 largely due to improved aps margins as a result of reduced amortization expense following the asset impairment charges that were recorded in the second quarter of 2020 and the effects of cost cutting efforts

reservoir performance 

fullyear 2020 revenue of 56 billion decreased 40 yearonyear a little more than half of this revenue decrease was attributable to the sharp drop in onestim pressure pumping activity in north america land the remaining portion of the revenue decline resulted from covid19 disruptions that caused international activity to be cancelled or suspended 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 435 bps to 6 due to the steep revenue decline

well construction

fullyear 2020 revenue of 86 billion decreased 28 yearonyear primarily due to the activity decline in us land as the rig count decreased significantly while covid19 disruptions caused drilling activities to be cancelled or suspended in several international markets

yearonyear pretax operating margin only decreased 196 bps to 10 as the effects of the revenue decline were partially mitigated by prompt cost cutting measures

production systems

fullyear 2020 revenue of 67 billion decreased 19 yearonyear primarily driven by lower sales of valves and surface systems in north america

digital  integration

fullyear 2019 revenue of 41 billion increased 9 yearonyear primarily driven by increased aps activity

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 181 bps to 21 primarily as a result of a less favorable revenue mix

yearonyear pretax operating margin was essentially unchanged at 104

interest and other income 

interest  other income consisted of the following 

 



 

the increase in earnings of equity method investments in 2020 as compared to 2019 is primarily related to higher income associated with schlumberger’s equity investments in rig and seismicrelated businesses while the decrease in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily related to lower income from those same businesses

the decrease in interest income in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily attributable to lower cash and shortterm investment balances

 

the unrealized gain on marketable securities in 2020 relates to an investment in a startup company that schlumberger previously invested in that completed an initial public offering during the fourth quarter of 2020  as a result schlumberger recognized an unrealized gain of 39 million to increase the carrying value of this investment to its fair value of 43 million as of december 31 2020  see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  

interest expense 

interest expense of 563 million in 2020 decreased 46 million compared to 2019 this decrease was primarily due to certain debt being refinanced with lower interest rate debt interest expense of 609 million in 2019 increased 34 million compared to 2018 this increase is primarily due to an increase in the weighted average debt balance during 2019 as compared to 2018

other 

research  engineering and general  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  were as follows 

 



 

income taxes 

the schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases the schlumberger effective tax rate generally decreases conversely when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases the schlumberger effective tax rate generally increases 

the schlumberger effective tax rate was 7 in 2020 as compared to 3 in 2019 the charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  reduced the effective tax rate by approximately 12 and 13 points in 2020 and 2019 respectively as a significant portion of these charges were not tax effective changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings accounted for the remaining increase in the effective tax rate in 2020 as compared to 2019

the schlumberger effective tax rate was 3 in 2019 as compared to 17 in 2018 the lower effective tax rate was almost entirely due to the 2019 charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  which primarily related to nondeductible goodwill

liquidity and capital resources 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic have resulted in a significant and swift reduction in international and us economic activity these effects have adversely affected the demand for oil and natural gas as well as for schlumberger’s products and services and caused significant volatility and disruption of the financial markets this period of extreme economic disruption low oil prices and reduced demand for schlumberger’s products and services has had and is likely to continue to have a material adverse impact on schlumberger’s business results of operations financial condition and at times access to sources of liquidity 

in view of the uncertainty of the depth and extent of the contraction in oil demand due to the covid19 pandemic combined with the weaker commodity price environment schlumberger turned its strategic focus to cash conservation and protecting its balance sheet as a result in april 2020 schlumberger announced a 75 reduction to its quarterly cash dividend the revised dividend supports schlumberger’s value proposition through a balanced approach of shareholder distributions and organic investment while providing flexibility to address the uncertain environment this decision reflects the company’s focus on its capital stewardship program as well as its commitment to maintain both a strong liquidity position and a strong investment grade credit rating that provides privileged access to the financial markets

summary of contractual obligations 

 



 







refer to note 17 pension and other benefit plans of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

 

as discussed in note 13  income taxes  of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2020 is approximately  13 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 tax jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 

schlumberger has outstanding letters of creditguarantees that relate to business performance bonds customexcise tax commitments facility leaserental obligations etc these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain 

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices adjustments to the allowance may be required in future periods depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments

as a large multinational company with a long history of operating in a cyclical industry schlumberger has extensive experience in working with its customers during difficult times to manage its accounts receivable during weak economic environments or when there is an extended period of weakness in oil and gas prices schlumberger typically experiences delays in the payment of its receivables however except for a 469 million accounts receivable writeoff during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the political and economic condition in venezuela schlumberger has not had material writeoffs due to uncollectible accounts receivable over the recent industry downturn schlumberger generates revenue in more than 120 countries as of december 31 2020 only five of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5 of schlumberger’s net accounts receivable balance of which only one mexico accounted for greater than 10 of such receivables

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill the goodwill relating to each of schlumberger’s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred 

under generally accepted accounting principles schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount there is no need to perform any further testing however if schlumberger concludes otherwise then it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded based on that difference 

schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test 

during 2020 and 2019 schlumberger recorded goodwill impairment charges of 31 billion and 88 billion respectively refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for details regarding the facts and circumstances that led to this impairment and how the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated including the significant assumptions used and other details 

longlived assets including fixed assets intangible assets and investments in aps projects are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual 

 

disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 

income taxes 

schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts schlumberger recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes that will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities that could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

revenue recognition for certain longterm constructiontype contracts

schlumberger recognizes revenue for certain longterm constructiontype contracts over time these contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customerspecific applications under this method revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs approximately 5 of schlumberger’s revenue in each of 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively was recognized under this method

the estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims profits are recognized based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete due to the nature of these projects adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs are often required as work progresses any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable

multiclient seismic data 

schlumberger capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december 31 2020 and 2019 was 317 million and 568 million respectively such costs are charged to cost of services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however an individual survey generally will not carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value 

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library surveys are primarily analyzed for impairment on a surveybysurvey basis 

 

pension and postretirement benefits 

schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements  the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate that schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of payment of the related benefit obligations the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans 









the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans was 660 in both 2020 and 2019 the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international pension plans was 671 in 2020 and 722 in 2019 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine the 2020 postretirement medical expense and the postretirement medical liability at december 31 2020 was 725 graded to 45 over the next eleven years 

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for schlumberger’s united states and international pension plans

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger generates revenue in more than 120 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar approximately 73 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2020 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will increase 

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on its earnings schlumberger enters into foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities and certain expenses denominated in currencies other than the functional currency

a 10 appreciation in the us dollar from the december 31 2020 market rates would increase the unrealized value of schlumberger’s forward contracts by 2 million conversely a 10 depreciation in the us dollar from the december 31 2020 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of schlumberger’s forward contracts by 5 million in either scenario the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future earnings

at december 31 2020 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 86 billion in various foreign currencies of which 64 billion related to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and occasionally interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2020 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 163 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately 06 billion 

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio shortterm investments which totaled approximately 22 billion at december 31 2020 are comprised primarily of money market funds time deposits certificates of deposit commercial paper bonds and notes substantially all of which are denominated in us dollars the average return on investments was 15 in 2020 

 

the following table reflects the carrying amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 20 20 by year of maturity 

 



 

 

the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 176 billion as of december 31 2020 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2020 was 10 

schlumberger does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes

founded in 1926 schlumberger is the world’s leading provider of technology for reservoir characterization drilling production and processing to the oil and gas industry having invented wireline logging as a technique for obtaining downhole data in oil and gas wells today schlumberger supplies the industry’s most comprehensive range of products and services from exploration through production and integrated poretopipeline solutions that optimize hydrocarbon recovery to deliver reservoir performance sustainably as of december 31 2019 the company employed approximately 105000 people representing over 170 nationalities schlumberger which generates revenue in more than 120 countries has executive offices in paris houston london and the hague 

schlumberger operates in each of the major oilfield service markets through four segments reservoir characterization drilling production and cameron each segment consists of a number of technologybased service and product lines or technologies these technologies cover the entire life cycle of the reservoir and correspond to a number of markets in which schlumberger holds leading positions the role of the technologies is to support schlumberger in providing the best possible service to customers and to ensure that schlumberger remains at the forefront of technology development and services integration the technologies are collectively responsible for driving performance throughout their businesses overseeing operational processes resource allocation and personnel and delivering superior financial results

the segments are as follows

reservoir characterization – consists of the principal technologies involved in finding and defining hydrocarbon resources these include westerngeco ®  wireline testing services software integrated solutions “sis” onesurface ® and integrated services management “ism” 

 



 



 



 



 



 



drilling – consists of the principal technologies involved in the drilling and positioning of oil and gas wells and comprises bits  drilling tools mi swaco drilling  measurements land rigs and integrated drilling services “ids” 

 



 

 



 



 



 



production – consists of the principal technologies involved in the lifetime production of oil and gas reservoirs and includes well services onestim ®  completions artificial lift and asset performance solutions “aps” 

 



 



 



 



 



 

aps creates alignment between schlumberger and the asset holder andor the operator whereby schlumberger receives remuneration in line with its value creation these projects are generally focused on developing and comanaging production of customer assets under longterm agreements schlumberger invests its own services and products and historically cash in certain cases into the field development activities and operations although in certain arrangements schlumberger is paid for a portion of the services or products it provides generally schlumberger will not be paid at the time of providing its services or upon delivery of its products instead schlumberger is generally compensated based upon cash flow generated or on a feeperbarrel basis this includes certain arrangements whereby schlumberger is only compensated based upon incremental production that it helps deliver above a mutually agreed baseline aps represented less than 5 of schlumberger’s consolidated revenue during each of 2019 2018 and 2017

cameron – consists of the principal technologies involved in pressure and flow control for drilling and intervention rigs oil and gas wells and production facilities and includes onesubsea ®  surface systems drilling systems and valves  process systems

intellectual property 

schlumberger owns and controls a variety of intellectual property including but not limited to patents proprietary information and software tools and applications that in the aggregate are material to schlumberger’s business while schlumberger seeks and holds numerous patents covering various products and processes no particular patent or group of patents is material to schlumberger’s business 

seasonality 

seasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of oilfield services for example the spring thaw in canada and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels while the winter months in the north sea russia and china can produce severe weather conditions that can temporarily reduce levels of activity in addition hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations furthermore customer spending patterns for multiclient data software and other oilfield services and products may result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of each year as clients seek to fully utilize their annual budgets conversely customer budget constraints may lead to lower demand for our services and products in the fourth quarter of each year 

customers and backlog of orders 

for the year ended december 31 2019 no single customer exceeded 10 of consolidated revenue other than the onesubsea drilling systems and westerngeco businesses schlumberger has no significant backlog due to the nature of its businesses the combined backlog of these businesses was 30 billion at december 31 2019 of which approximately 50 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2020 and 27 billion at december 31 2018

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors known to us contains important information for the understanding of our “forwardlooking statements” which are discussed immediately following item 7a of this form 10k and elsewhere these risk factors should also be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k 

we urge you to consider carefully the risks described below as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects 

demand for our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers the recent oil and gas industry downturn has and current market conditions have resulted in reduced demand for oilfield services and lower expenditures by our customers which have had and may in the future have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for our products and services depends substantially on expenditures by our customers for the exploration development and production of oil and natural gas reserves these expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ views of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to our customers’ views of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas 

declines as well as anticipated declines in oil and gas prices have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in lower capital expenditures project modifications delays or cancellations general business disruptions and delays in payment of or nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us these effects have had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

historically oil and natural gas prices have experienced significant volatility and can be affected by a variety of factors including 









 

















there can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas or for our products and services will follow historic patterns or recover meaningfully in the near term the oil and gas industry has historically experienced downturns which have been characterized by diminished demand for our products and services and downward pressure on the prices that we are able to charge sustained market uncertainty can also result in lower demand and pricing for our products and services a future downturn or sustained market uncertainty could again result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonunited states operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the over 120 countries in which we operate 

our nonunited states operations accounted for approximately 72 of our consolidated revenue in 2019 68 in 2018 and 74 in 2017 in addition to the risks addressed elsewhere in this section our operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 

























our failure to comply with complex us and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition

we are subject to complex us and foreign laws and regulations such as the fcpa the uk bribery act and various other antibribery and anticorruption laws we are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to and certain operations in various countries or with certain persons our ability to transfer people products and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations the internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of antibribery trade control trade sanctions or anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition violations of international and us laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business operating results and financial condition

 

demand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation  regulations and public sentiment  

environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the european union the united states and other regions or countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus reduce future demand for our products and services this may in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change could adversely affect our business reputation or demand for our stock there is also increased focus including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations investors and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability matters additionally some international national state and local governments and agencies have adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing future hydraulic fracturingrelated legislation or regulations could limit or ban hydraulic fracturing or lead to operational delays and increased costs and therefore reduce demand for our pressure pumping services enactment of additional international national state or local legislation or regulations can adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and could be material 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 

we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials chemicals and explosives and to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions hydraulic fracturing water discharges and waste management we incur and expect to continue to incur significant capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex stringent and expensive to implement these laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render us liable for damages without regard to our degree of care or fault some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances and as a result we could be liable for the actions of others 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

we could be subject to substantial liability claims including catastrophic well incidents which could adversely affect our reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health safety and environmental risks our operations involve productionrelated activities radioactive materials chemicals explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration development and production environments accidents involving these services or equipment or a failure of a product could cause personal injury loss of life damage to or destruction of property equipment or the environment or suspension of operations which could materially adversely affect us any catastrophic well incidents including blowouts at a well site may expose us to additional liabilities which could be material generally we rely on contractual indemnities releases and limitations on liability with our customers and insurance to protect us from potential liability related to such events however our insurance may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events including events involving pollution or against losses resulting from business interruption moreover we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain technology leadership this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold 

the oilfield service industry is highly competitive our ability to continually provide competitive technology and services can impact our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers failure to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in the various markets we serve could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights including our trade secrets could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold 

 

some of our products or services and the processes we use to produce or provide them have been granted patent protection have patent applications pending  or are trade secrets our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

third parties may claim that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services and products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our business royalty payments under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs if a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally developing noninfringing technologies would increase our costs 

failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations 

we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases and technology evolves in periods of high utilization it is often more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals this could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations 

severe weather may adversely affect our operations 

our business has been and in the future will be affected by severe weather in areas where we operate which could materially impact our operations and financial results this may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services in addition particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures which may result in a suspension of activities any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

cyberattacks could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operation

we rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business including systems operated by or under the control of third parties although we devote significant resources to protect our systems and proprietary data we have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal conduct of our business there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur breaches or circumvention of our systems or the systems of third parties including by ransomware or other attacks result in disruptions to our business operations unauthorized access to or the loss of company access to competitively sensitive confidential or other critical data or systems loss of customers financial losses regulatory fines and misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information any of which could be material

2019 executive overview 

schlumberger fullyear 2019 revenue of 329 billion was essentially flat with 2018 international revenue however grew in the high singledigits as anticipated 

in the oil markets sentiment was stable and positive for the first four months of 2019 with the brent oil price moving from 55 per barrel at the beginning of the year to a high of 75 per barrel in late april oecd crude and product stocks continued to increase through much of 2019 reversing a trend that persisted throughout the first half of 2018 internationally activity and investment continued to strengthen particularly offshore 

activity in north america land was strong in the first half of 2019 but slowed in the second half of the year as a combination of budget exhaustion and cash flow constraints impacted our customers although the slowing activity in the second half of the year was consistent with the trend experienced in 2018 activity dropped earlier and steeper in the second half of 2019 as compared to the previous year

by midyear concerns of a recession in the united states and indications of well supplied global oil markets pushed the oil price to its low point for the year these concerns abated over the latter part of the year as oil demand indicators trended positively though trade conflicts persisted they did not create a significant drag on oil markets for the balance of the year

the attacks on saudi arabia oil infrastructure in september 2019 caused a price increase of only 7 per barrel and the price of brent crude retreated to preattack levels over the course of the following week demonstrating that the markets were well supplied in december 2019 opec agreed to further production cuts in 2020 to alleviate the projected oversupply

global natural gas pricing was consistent with wellsupplied markets during 2019 liquified natural gas lng supply capacity increased by an estimated 10 during 2019 and consequently lng prices in asia and europe were less than half the prices seen in 2018

domestically us henry hub natural gas prices showed continued weakness during 2019 as north american gas production increased prices averaged 256 per million british thermal units “mmbtu” for the year with the peak of 425 per mmbtu occurring in march the price fell to its lowest point of 175 per mmbtu in december 

schlumberger financial performance in 2019 was primarily driven by the international markets fullyear 2019 international revenue of 218 billion increased 7 over 2018 again outpacing north america revenue and continuing a trend which began in the third quarter of 2018 this strong international performance was the result of increased activity on the part of operators as they continued to invest in longerterm resource development following a sustained period of underinvestment and declining production 

in contrast after two years of strong growth north american revenue fell sharply by 10 to 108 billion this decrease was largely driven by the land market weakness affecting the onestim pressure pumping business as customers reached their budget limits earlier in the year and remained highly disciplined on capital spend

additionally during the fourth quarter of 2019 schlumberger completed two major milestones the formation of the sensia joint venture and the divestiture of the drilling tools business together these two transactions resulted in schlumberger receiving net cash proceeds of 586 million

from a macro perspective the year ended with sentiment regarding 2020 oil demand growth turning positive as uncertainty reduced following the progress made toward a uschina trade deal the fall in the north america production growth estimate of between 400000 to 800000 barrelsperday should continue to support the thesis for international investment the recent escalation of geopolitical risk should set the floor for the oil price going forward in the near term schlumberger expects the opec production cuts agreed upon in december 2019 to limit investment and activity particularly in the middle east and russia during the first half of 2020 as the year progresses the effect of slowing north america production growth is likely to cause tightness in the market and further stimulate international operators to increase their investments in the second half of the year and beyond 

 

 

based on these factors the expectation is for the 2020 exploration and production capex spending growth rate in the international markets to be in the midsingledigit range schlumberger therefore expects its international portfolio revenue to grow at the same pace or higher excluding the effects of the businesses transferred to the sensia joint venture and the businesses divested in the drilling tools transaction the businesses included in these transactions accounted for approximately 2 of schlumberger’s global revenue in 2019 international revenue growth will be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year with increasing offshore activity improving activity mix from the early deepwater growth cycle and increasing exploration work toward the end of the year and into 2021

in north america schlumberger is continuing to scaletofit its organization and portfolio by repurposing or exiting underperforming business units focusing on assetlight operations and expanding its technology access business models schlumberger is cautiously optimistic that the highgrading of its portfolio will promote margin expansion and the improvement of returns in the north america land market 

 

fourth quarter 2019 results 

 



 









fourth quarter revenue of 82 billion was 4 lower sequentially international revenue of 57 billion grew 2 sequentially however north america revenue of 25 billion dropped 14 sequentially due to customer budget exhaustion and cash flow constraints

sequential international growth was led by the middle east  asia area where revenue increased 5 latin america revenue grew 1 while revenue in the europecisafrica area only declined 2 given the mild winter slowdown of activity in the northern hemisphere

the fourth quarter of 2019 delivered the first sequential growth in international margin in any fourth quarter since 2014 schlumberger is therefore confident that it has turned the corner particularly as it has experienced sequential international margin growth in each of the last three quarters meanwhile in north america land margin compression from lower activity was minimized by implementing a scaletofit strategy acting decisively in reducing capacity and restructuring operations to protect margins

 

reservoir characterization 

fourthquarter revenue of 16 billion decreased 1 sequentially following the end of the summer campaigns for wireline and testing activity in the north sea and russia where the mild winter did not significantly disrupt activity 

reservoir characterization pretax operating margin of 22 increased 59 basis points “bps” sequentially primarily driven by increased highmargin sis digital software sales 

drilling 

fourthquarter revenue of 24 billion decreased 1 sequentially primarily due to the end of the summer drilling campaign in russia and lower drilling activity in north america land

drilling pretax operating margin of 12 was flat sequentially as margin improvements from drilling projects in the middle east were offset by the seasonally lower margins in russia and lower drilling margins in north america land

production 

fourthquarter revenue of 29 billion declined 9 sequentially driven by lower activity and pricing for onestim in north america land due to expected customer budget limitations and cash flow constraints schlumberger continued to rightsize its hydraulic fracturing capacity by stacking more fleets in light of lower demand 

production pretax operating margin of 9 contracted by 32 bps sequentially due to the lower onestim activity partially offset by strength in international margins from higher activity 

cameron

fourthquarter revenue of 14 billion increased 2 sequentially from higher onesubsea surface systems and drilling systems revenue primarily in the international markets valves  process systems was lower sequentially due to the reduced north america land activity and as a result of contributing the valves  process systems measurement business to the sensia joint venture which closed on october 1 2019

cameron pretax operating margin of 9 contracted by 359 bps sequentially driven largely by reduced margins in the onesubsea project portfolio

 

fullyear 2019 results 

 



 









 

fullyear 2019 revenue of  329 billion was essentially flat yearonyear with north america revenue decreasing 10  and international revenue increasing 7  the international results were underpinned by increased investment levels in contrast the north america results reflect a slowing production growth rate on land as operators maintained capital discipline and reduced drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity 

reservoir characterization 

fullyear 2019 revenue of 63 billion increased 2 yearonyear primarily driven by increased international activity 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 79 bps to 21

drilling 

fullyear 2019 revenue of 97 billion increased 5 yearonyear primarily due to higher demand for drilling services largely in the international markets that benefited drilling  measurements mi swaco and integrated drilling services

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 89 bps to 13 despite higher revenue as margins were affected by competitive pricing and higher costs associated with a number of integrated contracts internationally

production 

fullyear 2019 revenue of 120 billion decreased 3 yearonyear with most of the revenue decline attributable to lower onestim activity in north america as customers reduced spending due to higher cost of capital lower borrowing capacity and expectation of better returns from their shareholders 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 20 bps to 8 primarily due to reduced profitability in onestim in north america 

cameron 

fullyear 2019 revenue of 53 billion decreased 3 yearonyear due to lower revenue for onesubsea and valves  process systems

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 35 bps to 11 

interest and other income 

interest  other income consisted of the following 

 



 

the decrease in interest income in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily attributable to lower cash and shortterm investment balances

the decrease in earnings from equity income is associated with schlumberger’s equity investments in rigand seismicrelated businesses

interest expense 

interest expense of 609 million in 2019 increased 34 million compared to 2018 this increase is primarily due to an increase in the weighted average debt balance during 2019 as compared to 2018

other 

research  engineering and general  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  were as follows 

 



 

 

income taxes 

the schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases the schlumberger effective tax rate generally decreases conversely when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases the schlumberger effective tax rate generally increases 

the schlumberger effective tax rate was 3 in 2019 as compared to 17 in 2018 the lower effective tax rate was almost entirely due to the charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  which primarily related to nondeductible goodwill

charges and credits 

schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits during 2019 and 2018 these charges and credits which are summarized below are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  

the following is a summary of the 2019 charges and credits of which the 247 million gain on the formation of the sensia joint venture is classified in gain on formation of sensia in the consolidated statement of income loss  while the 1315 billion of charges are classified in impairments  other 

 



 

a significant portion of the thirdquarter impairment charges were recorded effective august 31 2019 accordingly the 2019 results reflect a 108 million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense for the last four months of 2019 approximately 84 million of this amount relates to the production segment the remaining 24 million is reflected in the “corporate  other” line item

the following is a summary of the 2018 charges and credits of which the 215 million gain on the sale of the marine seismic acquisition business is classified in gain on sale of business in the consolidated statement of income loss  while the 356 million of charges are classified in impairments  other

the total outstanding commercial paper borrowings were 22 billion as of december 31 2019 and 24 billion as of december 31 2018 

summary of contractual obligations 

 



 







refer to note 17 pension and other benefit plans of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

as discussed in note 13 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2019 is approximately 13 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 tax jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain 

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices adjustments to the allowance may be required in future periods depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments

as a large multinational company with a long history of operating in a cyclical industry schlumberger has extensive experience in working with its customers during difficult times to manage its accounts receivable during weak economic environments or when there is an extended period of weakness in oil and gas prices schlumberger typically experiences delays in the payment of its receivables however except for a 469 million accounts receivable writeoff during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the political and economic conditions in venezuela schlumberger has not had material writeoffs due to uncollectible accounts receivable over the recent industry downturn schlumberger generates revenue in more than 120 countries as of december 31 2019 only three of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5 of schlumberger’s net receivables balance of which only one the united states accounted for greater than 10 of such receivables

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill the goodwill relating to each of schlumberger’s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred 

under generally accepted accounting principles schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount there is no need to perform any further testing however if schlumberger concludes otherwise then it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded based on that difference 

schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test 

during 2019 schlumberger recorded an 88 billion goodwill impairment charge refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for details regarding the facts and circumstances that led to this impairment and how the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated including the significant assumptions used and other details 

longlived assets including fixed assets intangible assets and investments in aps projects are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 

 

income taxes 

schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts schlumberger recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes that will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities that could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

revenue recognition for certain longlived constructiontype contracts

schlumberger recognizes revenue for certain longterm constructiontype contracts over time these contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customerspecific applications under this method revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs approximately 5 of schlumberger’s revenue in each of 2019 and 2018 respectively was recognized under this method

the estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims profits are recognized based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete due to the nature of these projects adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs are often required as work progresses any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable

multiclient seismic data 

schlumberger capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december 31 2019 and 2018 was 568 million and 601 million respectively such costs are charged to cost of services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value 

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library surveys are primarily analyzed for impairment on a surveybysurvey basis 

pension and postretirement benefits 

schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements  the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate that schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of payment of the related benefit obligations the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans 







 



the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans was 660 in 2019 and 725 in 2018 the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international pension plans was 722 in 2019 and 740 in 2018 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine the 2019 postretirement medical expense and the postretirement medical liability at december 31 2019 was 750 graded to 45 over the next twelve years 

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for schlumberger’s united states and international pension plans

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger generates revenue in more than 120 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar approximately 78 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2019 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will increase 

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on its earnings schlumberger enters into foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities and certain expenses denominated in currencies other than the functional currency

a 10 appreciation in the us dollar from the december 31 2019 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of schlumberger’s forward contracts by 8 million conversely a 10 depreciation in the us dollar from the december 31 2019 market rates would increase the unrealized value of schlumberger’s forward contracts by 9 million in either scenario the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future earnings

 

at december 31 201 9  contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of  77 billion in various foreign currencies  of which  30 billion relate d to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and occasionally interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2019 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 129 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately 24 billion before considering the effects of cross currency swaps 

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio shortterm investments which totaled approximately 10 billion at december 31 2019 are comprised primarily of money market funds time deposits certificates of deposit commercial paper bonds and notes substantially all of which are denominated in us dollars the average return on investments was 30 in 2019 

the following table reflects the carrying amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 2019 by year of maturity 

 



 

 

the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 134 billion as of december 31 2019 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2019 was 23 

schlumberger does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes

 item 1 business 

all references in this report to “registrant” “company” “schlumberger” “we” or “our” are to schlumberger limited schlumberger nv incorporated in curaçao and its consolidated subsidiaries

founded in 1926 schlumberger is the world’s leading provider of technology for reservoir characterization drilling production and processing to the oil and gas industry having invented wireline logging as a technique for obtaining downhole data in oil and gas wells today schlumberger supplies the industry’s most comprehensive range of products and services from exploration through production and integrated poretopipeline solutions that optimize hydrocarbon recovery to deliver reservoir performance as of december 31 2018 the company employed approximately 100000 people of over 140 nationalities operating in more than 85 countries schlumberger has executive offices in paris houston london and the hague 

schlumberger operates in each of the major oilfield service markets through four segments reservoir characterization drilling production and cameron each segment consists of a number of technologybased service and product lines or technologies these technologies cover the entire life cycle of the reservoir and correspond to a number of markets in which schlumberger holds leading positions the role of the technologies is to support schlumberger in providing the best possible service to customers and to ensure that schlumberger remains at the forefront of technology development and services integration the technologies are collectively responsible for driving excellence in execution throughout their businesses overseeing operational processes resource allocation and personnel and delivering superior financial results

the segments are as follows

reservoir characterization – consists of the principal technologies involved in finding and defining hydrocarbon resources these include westerngeco ®  wireline testing services onesurface ®  software integrated solutions “sis” and integrated services management “ism” 

 



 



 



 



 



 



drilling – consists of the principal technologies involved in the drilling and positioning of oil and gas wells and comprises bits  drilling tools mi swaco drilling  measurements land rigs and integrated drilling services “ids” 

 



 

 



 



 



 



production – consists of the principal technologies involved in the lifetime production of oil and gas reservoirs and includes well services onestim ®  completions artificial lift and schlumberger production management “spm” 

 



 



 



 



 



 

spm creates alignment between schlumberger and the asset holder andor the operator whereby schlumberger receives remuneration in line with its value creation these projects are generally focused on developing and comanaging production of customer assets under longterm agreements schlumberger will invest its own services and products and in some cases cash into the field development activities and operations although in certain arrangements schlumberger is paid for a portion of the services or products it provides generally schlumberger will not be paid at the time of providing its services or upon delivery of its products instead schlumberger is generally compensated based upon cash flow generated or on a feeperbarrel basis this includes certain arrangements whereby schlumberger is only compensated based upon incremental production that it helps deliver above a mutually agreed baseline spm represented less than 5 of schlumberger’s consolidated revenue during each of 2018 2017 and 2016

cameron – consists of the principal technologies involved in pressure and flow control for drilling and intervention rigs oil and gas wells and production facilities and includes onesubsea ®  surface systems drilling systems and valves  measurement 

 



 



 

 



 



supporting the technologies is a global network of research and engineering centers through this organization schlumberger is committed to advanced technology programs that enhance oilfield efficiency lower finding and producing costs improve productivity maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value while accomplishing these goals in a safe and environmentally sound manner

a network of geomarket regions within each of four major geographic areas of north america latin america europecisafrica and middle east  asia provides logistical technical and commercial coordination 

the geomarket structure offers customers a single point of contact at the local level for field operations and brings together geographically focused teams to meet local needs and deliver customized solutions the geomarkets are responsible for providing the most efficient and costeffective support possible to the operations

schlumberger primarily uses its own personnel to market its offerings the customer base business risks and opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all services and products manufacturing and engineering facilities as well as research centers are shared and the labor force is interchangeable technological innovation quality of service and price differentiation are the principal methods of competition which vary geographically with respect to the different services and products offered while schlumberger has numerous competitors both large and small schlumberger believes it is an industry leader in providing geophysical equipment and services wireline logging well production testing exploration and production software rig equipment surface equipment subsea equipment artificial lift hydraulic fracturing cementing coiledtubing services drilling and completion fluids solids control and waste management drilling pressure control drill bits measurementwhiledrilling loggingwhiledrilling directionaldrilling services and surface data mud logging

seasonality 

seasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of oilfield services for example the spring thaw in canada and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels while the winter months in the north sea russia and china can produce severe weather conditions that can temporarily reduce levels of activity in addition hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations furthermore customer spending patterns for multiclient data software and other oilfield services and products generally result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of each year as clients seek to fully utilize their annual budgets 

customers and backlog of orders 

for the year ended december 31 2018 no single customer exceeded 10 of consolidated revenue other than the onesubsea drilling systems and westerngeco businesses schlumberger has no significant backlog due to the nature of its businesses the combined backlog of these businesses was 27 billion at december 31 2018 of which approximately 50 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2019 and 25 billion at december 31 2017

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors known to us contains important information for the understanding of our “forwardlooking statements” which are discussed immediately following item 7a of this form 10k and elsewhere these risk factors should also be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k 

we urge you to consider carefully the risks described below as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k if any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this form 10k were to materialize our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers a substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures by our customers which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for our products and services depends substantially on expenditures by our customers for the exploration development and production of oil and natural gas reserves these expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ views of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to our customers’ views of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas declines as well as anticipated declines in oil and gas prices could result in project modifications delays or cancellations general business disruptions and delays in payment of or nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us these effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

historically oil and natural gas prices have experienced significant volatility and can be affected by a variety of factors including 













 











the oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns which have been characterized by diminished demand for our products and services as well as and downward pressure on the prices we charge sustained market uncertainty can also result in lower demand and pricing for our products and services a significant downturn or sustained market uncertainty could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonunited states operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the over 85 countries in which we operate 

our nonunited states operations accounted for approximately 69 of our consolidated revenue in 2018 74 in 2017 and 80 in 2016 operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 























our failure to comply with complex us and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations

we are subject to complex us and foreign laws and regulations such as the fcpa the uk bribery act and various other antibribery and anticorruption laws we are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to and certain operations in various countries or with certain persons our ability to transfer people products and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations the internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or violating applicable laws and regulations any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of antibribery trade control trade sanctions or anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition violations of international and us laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business operating results and financial condition

demand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation or regulations 

environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the united states and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gasses and their potential role in climate change existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our products and services this may in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

some international national state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in lowpermeability reservoirs specially engineered 

 

fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated causing cracks in the target formation proppant suc h as sand of a particular size is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete future hydraulic fracturingrelated legislation or regulations could limit or ban hydraulic fracturing or lead to operational delays and increased costs and therefore reduce demand for our pressure pumping services if such additional international national state or local legislation or regulations are enacted it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operation s and cash flows 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 

we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials chemicals and explosives and to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions hydraulic fracturing water discharges and waste management we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex stringent and expensive to implement these laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

we could be subject to substantial liability claims including catastrophic well incidents which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health safety and environmental risks our offerings involve productionrelated activities radioactive materials chemicals explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration development and production environments an accident involving these services or equipment or a failure of a product could cause personal injury loss of life damage to or destruction of property equipment or the environment or suspension of operations catastrophic well incidents including blow outs at a well site may expose us to additional liabilities generally we rely on contractual indemnities releases limitations on liability with our customers and insurance to protect us from potential liability related to such events however our insurance may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events including events involving pollution or against losses resulting from business interruption moreover we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain technology leadership this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold 

the oilfield service industry is highly competitive our ability to continually provide competitive technology and services can impact our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers if we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in the various markets we serve it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights including our trade secrets could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold 

some of our products or services and the processes we use to produce or provide them have been granted patent protection have patent applications pending or are trade secrets our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we may be subj ect to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our business royalty payments under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs additionally developing noninfringing technologies would increase our costs if a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations 

we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases in periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals this could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations 

severe weather may adversely affect our operations 

our business may be materially affected by severe weather in areas where we operate this may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services in addition if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures this may result in a suspension of activities any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

cyberattacks could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operation

we rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business including systems operated by or under the control of third parties although we devote significant resources to protect our systems and proprietary data we have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal conduct of our business there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems when such incidents or attacks do occur if our systems or the systems of third parties for protecting against cybersecurity risks are circumvented or breached or we are subject to ransomware or other attacks this could result in disruptions to our business operations unauthorized access to or the loss of company access to competitively sensitive confidential or other critical data or systems loss of customers financial losses regulatory fines misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements including without limitation statements relating to our plans strategies objectives expectations intentions and resources such forwardlooking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under “item 1a risk factors” of this form 10k 

2018 executive overview 

schlumberger fullyear 2018 revenue of 328 billion increased 8 over 2017 this revenue growth was driven almost entirely by increased activity in north america against a backdrop of increasing oil prices throughout most of the year 

in the oil markets sentiment was stable and positive for the first three quarters of 2018 providing a rising oil price environment oecd crude and product stocks continued a downward trend that began in the third quarter of 2016 production cuts from opec and russia in 2017 served to strengthen the oil price activity picked up globally and as oil reached its peak price for the year in october production from major producers including unconventional us production began to surprise to the upside output in libya rebounded sharply saudi arabia and the united arab emirates each recorded record production output and dispensations from the iran export sanctions generated aggregate production that more than offset declines elsewhere 

as a result the market became oversupplied at the beginning of the fourth quarter despite the anticipated slowdown in the permian basin production growth due to capacity takeaway constraints this coupled with concerns about global oil demand caused oil prices to plummet by more than 40 during the fourth quarter of 2018 and led to a sudden and sharp decrease in us land well completion activity during the final months of the year

in the natural gas markets consumption of liquified natural gas “lng” continued to rise enabled by vast sources of new supply the us became a lng exporter in 2016 when the first shipment left sabine pass in louisiana us export capacity grew to 37 million tonnes in 2018 and is set to nearly double in 2019 underground gas storage in the us was below average through most of 2018 however rising gas production from unconventional oil and gas wells in the us northeast midcontinent and the permian basin helped to keep henry hub prices well below international prices this will allow the us to join australia and the middle east as significant exporters

schlumberger financial performance in 2018 was driven largely by north america where revenue of 120 billion grew 26 yearoveryear despite the steep falloff in activity during the fourth quarter of the year this growth was driven by increased land activity that primarily benefited schlumberger’s onestim business where revenue grew 41 

fullyear 2018 international revenue of 204 billion was essentially flat compared with 2017 during the third quarter of 2018 international revenue grew faster than north america revenue for the first time since 2014 marking the beginning of a positive activity trend after three consecutive years of declining revenue this was driven by the increased activity of national oil companies “nocs” as they began to invest in longerterm resource development following a sustained period of deep underinvestment and declining production 

the dramatic fall in oil prices in the fourth quarter was largely driven by higherthanexpected us shale production as a result of the surge in activity earlier in the year and as geopolitics negatively impacted the global demand and supplybalance sentiments the combination of these two factors together with a large selloff in the equity markets due to concerns around global growth and increasing us interest rates created a nearperfect storm to close out 2018 

looking ahead to 2019 schlumberger expects a more positive supply and demandbalance sentiment to lead to a gradual recovery in the price of oil over the course of the year as the opec and russia production cuts take full effect the effect of lower activity in north america land in the second half of 2018 impacts production growth the dispensations from the iran export sanctions expire and are not renewed and as the us and china continue to work toward a solution to their ongoing trade dispute 

in the meantime the recent oil price volatility has introduced more uncertainty around the global exploration and production “ep” spending outlook for 2019 with customers generally taking a more conservative approach at the start of the year however based on recent discussions with customers schlumberger is seeing clear signs that ep investments are starting to normalize and reflect a more sustainable financial stewardship of the global resource base for the north america land ep operators this means that future investments will likely be much closer to the level that can be covered by free cash flow conversely in the international markets apart from the middle east and russia after four years of underinvestment and a focus on maximizing cash flow the nocs and independents are starting to see the need to invest in their resource base simply to maintain production at current levels 

this means that even with the current oil price levels schlumberger expects solid singledigit growth in the international markets while in north america land the increased cost of capital and focus on aligning investments closer to free cash flow has introduced more uncertainty to the outlook for both drilling and production activity 

 

  

fourth quarter 2018 results 

 



 









fourthquarter revenue of 82 billion declined 4 sequentially driven by lower activity and pricing for most production and cameronrelated businesses in north america land lower revenue from onesubsea also contributed to the decline international activity remained resilient despite the oil price drop with revenue increasing 1 sequentially the seasonal slowdown in russia was offset by increased revenue in the middle east asia and africa revenue from europe and latin america was flat compared with the previous quarter sequential performance was heavily impacted by production and cameronrelated activity declines in north america land as seen by the 12 sequential decrease of revenue in north america onestim revenue dropped 25 sequentially as a number of fleets were warmstacked during the latter part of the quarter and as schlumberger focused on securing dedicated contracts for the first half of 2019 early in the fourthquarter tendering cycle

reservoir characterization 

fourthquarter revenue of 17 billion decreased 1 sequentially driven by the seasonal decline in wireline activity in russia lower wireline exploration activity offshore north america and reduced onesurface activity in the middle east these effects were partially offset by yearend sales of sis software 

reservoir characterization pretax operating margin of 22 was essentially flat compared with the previous quarter as the effect of highmargin sis software sales was offset by the seasonal decline in highermargin wireline revenue

drilling 

fourthquarter revenue of 25 billion increased 1 sequentially driven primarily by international growth in drilling  measurements and mi swaco while drilling revenue remained resilient in north america land 

drilling pretax operating margin of 13 decreased 105 basis points “bps” sequentially due to a seasonal activity decline in russia and the increased cost of mobilizing additional resources as ids project activity scaled up across international operations

production 

 

fourthquarter revenue of 29 billion declined 10 sequentially onestim revenue in north america land dropped 25 accounting for the vast majority of the production revenue decrease as a number of fleets were warmstacked during the latter part of the quarter due to market ove rsupply conditions 

production pretax operating margin of 7 decreased 310 bps sequentially due to reduced pricing and activity in the onestim business in north america land

cameron 

cameron revenue of 13 billion declined 3 sequentially as increased international sales in surface systems were more than offset by lower revenue from the onesubsea and valves  measurement product lines onesubsea booked more than 600 million in new project orders during the fourth quarter of 2018 indicating that it is now close to the cycle trough of backlogdriven activity 

cameron pretax operating margin of 10 declined 140 bps sequentially due to lower onesubsea margins

fullyear 2018 results 



 









fullyear 2018 revenue of 328 billion increased 8 yearonyear and grew for the second successive year performance was driven by north america where revenue of 120 billion increased 26 due to the onestim business which grew by 41 fullyear international revenue of 204 billion was essentially flat compared with 2017 

fullyear 2018 pretax operating income of 42 billion grew 7 yearonyear pretax operating margin of 13 was essentially flat with the previous year as the impact of higher revenue was offset by reactivation and mobilization costs associated with the rampup and strategic positioning for increased activity in both north america and internationally

reservoir characterization 

fullyear 2018 revenue of 65 billion decreased 4 yearonyear primarily due to reduced onesurface revenue following the end of the first phase of an integrated production system project in the middle east and reduced westerngeco activity as marine seismic acquisition contracts wound down during 2018 following the fourth quarter 2017 decision to cease all future marine seismic acquisition activities after satisfying schlumberger’s remaining commitments 

 

yearonyear pretax operating margin increased 303 bps to 21 primarily as a result of reduced depr eciation and amortization following the westerngeco impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 

drilling 

fullyear 2018 revenue of 93 billion increased 10 yearonyear primarily due to higher demand for directional drilling technologies on land in north america and the start of new integrated drilling projects internationally this benefited drilling  measurements bits  drilling tools mi swaco and integrated drilling services 

yearonyear pretax operating margin declined 32 bps to 13

production 

fullyear 2018 revenue of 124 billion increased 17 yearonyear with most of the revenue increase attributable to the accelerated land activity growth in north america that benefited the onestim pressure pumping businesses in north america land for the first three quarters of 2018 growth was driven by the deployment of additional hydraulic fracturing capacity market share gains operational efficiency improvements and improved pricing

yearonyear pretax operating margin declined 32 bps to 8 

cameron 

fullyear 2018 revenue of 52 billion decreased 1 yearonyear a 15 revenue increase in the shortcycle business of surface systems driven by higher north america land activity was offset by a 12 decline in the longcycle onesubsea business

yearonyear pretax operating margin of 12 declined 232 bps due primarily to the decline in highmargin onesubsea project volumes

fullyear 2017 results 

 



 









 

fullyear 2017 revenue of 304 billion increased 9 yearonyear this included a full year of activity from the acquired cameron businesses versus nine months of activity for the same period in 2016 excluding the impact of cameron revenue increased 7 year

 

onyear the growth was primarily driven by north america where the land rig count increased more than 80 versus the same period last year 

fullyear 2017 pretax operating margin was expanded 111 bps to 13 as improved profitability in north america due to the land activity growth that benefited production and drilling was offset by margin declines in reservoir characterization and cameron

reservoir characterization 

fullyear 2017 revenue of 68 billion increased 2 yearonyear primarily due to higher westerngeco and wireline revenue on projects in the middle east  asia area north america land russia and mexico 

yearonyear pretax operating margin was essentially flat at 18 

drilling 

fullyear 2017 revenue of 84 billion decreased 2 yearonyear primarily due to the rig count declines internationally and in offshore north america combined with pricing pressure revenue also declined as a result of schlumberger’s decision in april 2016 to reduce its activities in venezuela to align operations with cash collections 

 

yearonyear pretax operating margin increased 210 bps to 14 primarily due to improved profitability in north america due to accelerated land activity and improved pricing this improvement was partially offset by the negative impact of reduced activity in venezuela

production 

fullyear 2017 revenue of 106 billion increased 21 yearonyear with most of the revenue increase attributable to the accelerated land activity growth in north america that benefited the pressure pumping business which grew 44 lower spm production levels in ecuador partially offset the revenue increase 

yearonyear pretax operating margin increased 298 bps to 9 as a result of improved profitability in north america due to the accelerated land activity and improved pricing this was partially offset by reduced margins in spm due to lower production in ecuador

cameron 

cameron contributed fullyear revenue of 52 billion cameron revenue for 2016 included only nine months of revenue following the april 2016 closing of the acquisition revenue in 2017 was impacted by a declining project backlog particularly for the longcycle businesses of drilling systems and onesubsea

yearonyear pretax operating margin of 14 decreased 142 bps as a result of lower drilling systems project volumes 

interest and other income 

interest  other income consisted of the following 

 



 

the decrease in interest income in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily attributable to lower cash and shortterm investment balances

interest expense 

interest expense of 575 million in 2018 566 million in 2017 and 570 million in 2016 has been essentially flat

 

other 

research  engineering and general  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  were as follows 

 



 

research  engineering costs have decreased in terms of both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue over the past two years as a result of cost control measures 

income taxes 

the schlumberger effective tax rate was 17 in 2018 28 in 2017 and 15 in 2016 

the schlumberger effective tax rate has historically been sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases the schlumberger effective tax rate generally decreases conversely when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases the schlumberger effective tax rate generally increases 

as discussed in further detail in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” the act which is also commonly referred to as “us tax reform” significantly changed us corporate income tax laws by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 starting in 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of us subsidiaries

the effective tax rate for each of 2017 and 2016 was significantly impacted by the charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements because they were only partially taxeffective excluding the impact of these charges and credits the effective tax rate was 17 in 2018 18 in 2017 and 16 in 2016 the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2018 as compared to 2017 excluding the impact of charges and credits was primarily due to the impact of us tax reform the increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 as compared to 2016 excluding the impact of charges and credits was primarily attributable to a change in the geographic mix of earnings as the percentage of pretax earnings generated in north america increased compared to 2016 

charges and credits 

schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits during 2018 2017 and 2016 these charges and credits which are summarized below are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  

the following is a summary of the 2018 charges and credits of which the 215 million gain on the sale of the marine seismic acquisition business is classified in gain on sale of business in the consolidated statement of income loss  while the remaining 356 million of other charges are classified in impairments  other 



 

the following is a summary of the 201 7 charges and credits of which  3 211 billion were classified in impairments  other   245 million were classified in cost of sales and  308 million were classified in merger  integration in the consolidated statement of income loss  



the following is a summary of the 2016 charges and credits of which 3172 billion were classified in impairments  other 349 million were classified in merger  integration and 299 million were classified in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of income loss 



 

liquidity and capital resources 

schlumberger had total cash  shortterm investments and fixed income investments held to maturity of 28 billion 51 billion and 95 billion at december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively total debt was 161 billion 182 billion and 196 billion at december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively

schlumberger’s international defined benefit pension plans were a combined 97 funded at both december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 based on their projected benefit obligations 

schlumberger expects to contribute approximately 25 million to its postretirement benefit plans in 2019 subject to market and business conditions 

 









in order to partially fund the purchase of the 138 million shares of common stock from schlumberger limited that were transferred to cameron stockholders shc issued 6 billion of notes during the fourth quarter of 2015 consisting of the following











as of december 31 2018 schlumberger had 28 billion of cash and shortterm investments on hand schlumberger also has separate committed credit facility agreements aggregating 65 billion with commercial banks of which 41 billion was available and unused as of december 31 2018 the 65 billion of committed credit facility agreements support commercial paper programs schlumberger believes these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months

the total outstanding commercial paper borrowings were 24 billion as of december 31 2018 and 30 billion as of december 31 2017 

summary of contractual obligations 









refer to note 18 pension and other benefit plans of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

as discussed in note 14 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2018 is approximately 14 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 

 

schlumberger has outstanding letters of creditguarantees that relate to business performance bonds customexcise tax commitments facility leaserental obligations etc these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are cu stomary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain 

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices adjustments to the allowance may be required in future periods depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments

as a large multinational company with a long history of operating in a cyclical industry schlumberger has extensive experience in working with its customers during difficult times to manage its accounts receivable during weak economic environments or when there is an extended period of weakness in oil and gas prices schlumberger typically experiences delays in the payment of its receivables however except as described below schlumberger has not had material writeoffs due to uncollectible accounts receivable over the recent industry downturn schlumberger operates in more than 85 countries as of december 31 2018 only three of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5 of schlumberger’s net receivables balance of which only one the united states accounted for greater than 10 of such receivables

in april 2016 schlumberger announced that it was reducing its activity in venezuela to align operations with cash collections as a result of insufficient payments on outstanding receivables schlumberger also previously disclosed that its judgment regarding the collectibility of its receivables and promissory notes in venezuela is sensitive to the political and economic conditions in the country and that if conditions in venezuela worsen schlumberger may be required to record adjustments to the carrying value of these assets during the fourth quarter of 2017 conditions in venezuela further deteriorated such that schlumberger determined it was appropriate to writeoff the remaining outstanding receivable balance of approximately 469 million and record an impairment charge of 105 million related to the aforementioned promissory notes

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill the goodwill relating to each of schlumberger’s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred 

under generally accepted accounting principles schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount there is no need to perform any further testing however if schlumberger concludes otherwise then it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded based on that difference 

schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test 

schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test in 2018 based on this assessment schlumberger concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying amount accordingly no further testing was required 

 

longlived assets including fixed assets  intangible assets and investments in spm projects  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be reco verable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the a sset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significan t estimates on the part of management if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 

income taxes 

schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts schlumberger recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes that will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities that could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

revenue recognition for certain longlived constructiontype contracts

schlumberger recognizes revenue for certain longterm constructiontype contracts over time these contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customerspecific applications under this method revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs approximately 5 and 7 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2018 and 2017 respectively was recognized under this method

the estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims profits are recognized based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete due to the nature of these projects adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs are often required as work progresses any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable

multiclient seismic data 

schlumberger capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december 31 2018 and 2017 was 601 million and 727 million respectively such costs are charged to cost of services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value 

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library surveys are primarily analyzed for impairment on a surveybysurvey basis 

pension and postretirement benefits 

schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements  the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate that schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of payment of the related benefit obligations the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans 



 







the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expected rates of return for the investment portfolio with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans was 725 in both 2018 and 2017 the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international pension plans was 740 in both 2018 and 2017 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine the 2018 postretirement medical expense was 700 graded to 50 over the next nine years the overall medical trend rate assumption utilized to determine the postretirement medical liability at december 31 2018 was 700 graded to 50 over the next nine years 

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for schlumberger’s united states and international pension plans

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger operates in more than 85 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar approximately 80 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2018 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will increase 

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on its earnings schlumberger enters into foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities and certain expenses denominated in currencies other than the functional currency

a 10 appreciation in the us dollar from the december 31 2018 market rates would increase the unrealized value of schlumberger’s forward contracts by 132 million conversely a 10 depreciation in the us dollar from the december 31 2018 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of schlumberger’s forward contracts by 143 million in either scenario the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future earnings

at december 31 2018 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 50 billion in various foreign currencies of which 19 billion related to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and occasionally interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2018 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 132 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately 28 billion before considering the effects of cross currency swaps 

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio shortterm investments which totaled approximately 13 billion at december 31 2018 are comprised primarily of money market funds time deposits certificates of deposit commercial paper bonds and notes substantially all of which are denominated in us dollars the average return on investments was 23 in 2018 

 

the following table reflects the carrying amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 201 8 by year of maturity 

 



 

the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 131 billion as of december 31 2018 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2018 was 35

founded in 1926 schlumberger is the world’s leading provider of technology for reservoir characterization drilling production and processing to the oil and gas industry having invented wireline logging as a technique for obtaining downhole data in oil and gas wells today schlumberger supplies the industry’s most comprehensive range of products and services from exploration through production and integrated poretopipeline solutions that optimize hydrocarbon recovery to deliver reservoir performance as of december 31 2017 the company employed approximately 100000 people of over 140 nationalities operating in more than 85 countries schlumberger has executive offices in paris houston london and the hague 

schlumberger operates in each of the major oilfield service markets managing its business through four groups reservoir characterization drilling production and cameron each group consists of a number of technologybased service and product lines or technologies these technologies cover the entire life cycle of the reservoir and correspond to a number of markets in which schlumberger holds leading positions the role of the groups and technologies is to support schlumberger in providing the best possible service to customers and to ensure that schlumberger remains at the forefront of technology development and services integration the groups and technologies are collectively responsible for driving excellence in execution throughout their businesses overseeing operational processes resource allocation and personnel and delivering superior financial results

the groups are as follows

reservoir characterization group – consists of the principal technologies involved in finding and defining hydrocarbon resources these include westerngeco ®  wireline testing services onesurface sm  software integrated solutions sis and integrated services management ism 

 



 



 



 



 



 



drilling group – consists of the principal technologies involved in the drilling and positioning of oil and gas wells and comprises bits  drilling tools mi swaco ®  drilling  measurements land rigs and integrated drilling services “ids” 

 



 

 



 



 



 



production group – consists of the principal technologies involved in the lifetime production of oil and gas reservoirs and includes well services onestim sm  completions artificial lift integrated production services “ips” and schlumberger production management “spm” 

 



 



 



 



 



 



 

spm creates alignment between schlumberger and the asset holder andor the operator whereby schlumberger receives remuneration in line with its value creation these projects are generally focused on developing and comanaging production of customer assets under longterm agreements schlumberger will invest its own services and products and in some cases cash into the field development activities and operations although in certain arrangements schlumberger is paid for a portion of the services or products it provides generally schlumberger will not be paid at the time of providing its services or upon delivery of its products instead schlumberger is generally compensated based upon cash flow generated or on a feeperbarrel basis this includes certain arrangements whereby schlumberger is only compensated based upon incremental production that it helps deliver above a mutually agreed baseline spm represented less than 5 of schlumberger’s consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2017

cameron group – consists of the principal technologies involved in pressure and flow control for drilling and intervention rigs oil and gas wells and production facilities and includes onesubsea ®  surface systems drilling systems and valves  measurement 

 



 



 



 



 



supporting the groups is a global network of research and engineering centers through this organization schlumberger is committed to advanced technology programs that enhance oilfield efficiency lower finding and producing costs improve productivity maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value while accomplishing these goals in a safe and environmentally sound manner

schlumberger’s business is also reported through four geographic areas north america latin america europecisafrica and middle east  asia within these geographic areas a network of geomarket regions provides logistical technical and commercial coordination 

the geomarket structure offers customers a single point of contact at the local level for field operations and brings together geographically focused teams to meet local needs and deliver customized solutions the geomarkets are responsible for providing the most efficient and costeffective support possible to the operations

schlumberger primarily uses its own personnel to market its offerings the customer base business risks and opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all services and products manufacturing and engineering facilities as well as research centers are shared and the labor force is interchangeable technological innovation quality of service and price differentiation are the principal methods of competition which vary geographically with respect to the different services and products offered while schlumberger has numerous competitors both large and small schlumberger believes that it is an industry leader in providing geophysical equipment and services wireline logging well production testing exploration and production software rig equipment surface equipment subsea equipment artificial lift hydraulic fracturing cementing coiledtubing services drilling and completion fluids solids control and waste management drilling pressure control drill bits measurementwhiledrilling loggingwhiledrilling directionaldrilling services and surface data mud logging

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors known to us contains important information for the understanding of our “forwardlooking statements” which are discussed immediately following item 7a of this form 10k and elsewhere these risk factors should also be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k 

we urge you to consider carefully the risks described below as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k if any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this form 10k were to materialize our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for the majority of our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers the oil and gas industry downturn has resulted in reduced demand for oilfield services which has had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for the majority of our products and services depends substantially on expenditures by our customers for the exploration development and production of oil and natural gas reserves these expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ views of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to our customers’ views of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas oil and gas prices have declined significantly from their highs in 2014 resulting in lower expenditures by our customers during the downturn many of our customers reduced or delayed their oil and gas exploration and production spending reducing the demand for our products and services and exerting downward pressure on the prices that we have been able to charge these conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

lower oil and gas prices have resulted in a reduction in cash flows for our customers this has resulted in and may continue to result in project modifications delays and cancellations general business disruptions and delays in payment of or nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us these effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors including 



 





















there can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas will follow historic patterns or recover meaningfully in the near term continued or worsening conditions in the oil and gas industry could have a further material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonunited states operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the over 85 countries in which we operate 

our nonunited states operations accounted for approximately 74 of our consolidated revenue in 2017 80 in 2016 and 76 in 2015 operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 























our failure to comply with complex us and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations

we are subject to complex us and foreign laws and regulations such as the fcpa the uk bribery act and various other antibribery and anticorruption laws we are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to and certain operations in various countries or with certain persons our ability to transfer people and products among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations the internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or violating applicable laws and regulations any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of antibribery trade control trade sanctions or anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition violations of international and us laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business operating results and financial condition

 

demand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation or regulations 

environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the united states and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gasses and their potential role in climate change existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our products and services this may in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

some international national state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in lowpermeability reservoirs specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated causing cracks in the target formation proppant such as sand of a particular size is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete future hydraulic fracturingrelated legislation or regulations could limit or ban hydraulic fracturing or lead to operational delays and increased costs and therefore reduce demand for our pressure pumping services if such additional international national state or local legislation or regulations are enacted it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 

we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials chemicals and explosives and to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions hydraulic fracturing water discharges and waste management we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex stringent and expensive to implement these laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

we could be subject to substantial liability claims which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health safety and environmental risks our offerings involve productionrelated activities radioactive materials chemicals explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration development and production environments an accident involving these services or equipment or a failure of a product could cause personal injury loss of life damage to or destruction of property equipment or the environment or suspension of operations our insurance may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events including events involving pollution or against losses resulting from business interruption moreover we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain technology leadership this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold 

the oilfield service industry is highly competitive our ability to continually provide competitive technology and services can impact our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers if we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in the various markets we serve it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights including our trade secrets could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold 

some of our products or services and the processes we use to produce or provide them have been granted patent protection have patent applications pending or are trade secrets our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not 

 

adequately protected our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets which could adver sely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our business royalty payments under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs additionally developing noninfringing technologies would increase our costs if a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations 

we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases in periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals this could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations 

severe weather conditions may adversely affect our operations 

our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate this may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services in addition if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures this may result in a suspension of activities any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

cyberattacks could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operation

we rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business although we devote significant resources to protect our systems and data we have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal conduct of our business there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems when such incidents or attacks do occur if our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks are circumvented or breached this could result in disruptions to our business operations access to our financial reporting systems the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware or other attacks or other loss misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information including our intellectual property and customer data

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements including without limitation statements relating to our plans strategies objectives expectations intentions and resources such forwardlooking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under “item 1a risk factors” of this form 10k 

2017 executive overview 

schlumberger fullyear 2017 revenue of 304 billion increased 9 yearonyear this reflects a full year of activity from the acquired cameron businesses as compared to only three quarters of activity in 2016 in addition to the impact of cameron revenue growth was driven by unconventional land resource developments in north america due to the recovery in activity combined with market share gains and improved pricing as the oil and gas industry began to emerge from the longest and deepest downturn in 30 years 

following two successive years of ep investment cuts operators increased their upstream spend in north america by more than 30 in 2017 the increase in oil price afforded by the opec agreement gave us producers a means to increase their investment in tight oil however apprehension related to growing us supply and uncertainty surrounding the duration of opec and russia led production cuts held international spending to a level 3 below 2016

during 2017 the outlook improved for international markets evidenced by a significant increase in the sanctioning of new projects the number of final investment decisions tripled in 2017 as compared to 2016 with 75 of the new projects planned for shallow and deepwater offshore environments 

after starting the year at 55 per barrel brent prices fell to 44 in june and then recovered to 67 by the end of the year the price increase resulted from 2017 demand growth of 15 million barrels per day and strong adherence to a production agreement between opec and russia which served to reduce oil production by an average of 16 million barrels per day compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 strong demand and restricted supply accelerated the depletion of stocks as the year progressed by september oecd crude and product stocks had returned to 2015 levels 

as the oil market began to rebalance in 2017 replacement of conventional oil reserves remains a challenge in 2017 discoveries were at an alltime low due to lower exploration activity and more than 60 of discovered resources were gas oil discoveries accounted for only 34 billion barrels while about 30 billion barrels of conventional oil is produced each year representing a reserves replacement ratio of only 11

in the natural gas markets low henry hub prices and flat domestic consumption allowed the us to transition from importer to exporter of natural gas for the first time since 1957 and liquified natural gas was the enabler global lng trading increased 11 yearonyear driven by demand in asia lng supply growth was also strong with the addition of six new liquefaction trains in 2017 in todays wellsupplied market both producers and consumers are reluctant to invest in new projects while the shortterm market outlook remains challenged strong longerterm demand growth signals a future need for new lng supply capacity

schlumberger’s financial performance in 2017 was driven by land activity in north america where revenue increased over 80 in line with the average rig count increase continued expansion of schlumberger’s hydraulic fracturing presence in north america resulted in additional fleet redeployments which benefited the production group drilling group revenue in north america land increased due to the continuing high demand for longer horizontal lateral sections in shale oil wells increased cameron surface and drilling systems product sales and services also contributed to the strong financial performance in north america north america revenue including offshore grew 42 yearonyear

international revenue decreased 2 as compared to 2016 this decline was driven by soft demand for exploration and developmentrelated products and services as ep budgets remained tight activity in latin american decreased due to schlumberger’s decision to align operations with cash collections in venezuela robust activity in the middle east and russia driven by integrated drilling and production projects as well as an additional quarter of activity from the acquired cameron businesses partially offset these decreases

during the past three years of unprecedented market downturn schlumberger has proactively sought to strengthen its technology offering and presence in key markets around the world the most recent example is the expansion of its hydraulic fracturing presence in north america land through the purchase of the us fracturing and pumpdown perforating businesses from weatherford in line with the challenging business environment over the same period schlumberger has restructured all relevant parts of the company in terms of both size and organizational structure to maximize its market competitiveness and operational agility

with the significant changes seen in customer priorities and buying habits in recent years schlumberger has continued to evaluate the present and future return prospects for all of its product lines as it seeks to maximize its longterm financial performance based on 

 

this indepth analysis schlumberger identified the seismic acquisition business as the only product line that does not meet schlumberger’s return expectations going forward even after factoring in an eventual market recovery  schlumberger has therefore taken the difficult d ecision to exit the marine and land seismic acquisition market and instead operate the westerngeco product line as an assetlight business built on its leading position within multiclient data processing and geophysical interpretation 

looking at the oil market the strong growth in demand is projected to continue in 2018 on the back of a robust global economy on the supply side the extension of the opec and russialed production cuts is already translating into higherthanexpected inventory draws in north america 2018 shale oil production is set for another year of strong growth as the positive oil market sentiments will likely increase both investment appetite and availability of financing at the same time the production base in the rest of the world is showing fatigue after three years of unprecedented underinvestment the underlying signs of weakness will likely become more evident in the coming year as the production additions from investments made in the previous upcycle start to noticeably fall off taken together this means the oil market is now in balance and the previous oversupply discount is gradually being replaced by a market tightness premium which makes schlumberger increasingly positive on the global outlook for its business

these positive oil market sentiments are reflected in thirdparty ep spend surveys that predict 1520 growth in north american investments in 2018 while the international market is expected to grow for the first time in four years with a projected 5 increase in spend as a result as schlumberger enters the first year of expected growth in all parts of its global operations since 2014 there is a renewed excitement and enthusiasm throughout the organization and schlumberger remains committed to delivering marketleading products and services to its customers and superior returns to its shareholders

 

 

fullyear 2017 results 

 



 









 

fullyear 2017 revenue of 304 billion increased 9 yearonyear this included a full year of activity from the acquired cameron businesses versus nine months of activity for the same period in 2016 excluding the impact of the cameron group revenue increased 7 yearonyear the growth was primarily driven by north america where the land rig count increased more than 80 versus the same period last year 

 

fullyear revenue for the drilling group declined 2 primarily driven by the 8 decline in offshore rig count combined with schlumberger’s decision in april 2016 to reduce its activities in venezuela to align operations with cash collections production 

 

group revenue increased 21 due to the accelerated land pressure pumping activity growth in north ame rica while the reservoir characterization group revenue improved 2 

fullyear 2017 pretax operating margin was expanded 111 basis points “bps” to 13 as improved profitability in north america due to the land activity growth that benefited the production and drilling groups was offset by margin declines in the reservoir characterization and cameron groups

fullyear 2017 revenue of 68 billion increased 2 yearonyear primarily due to higher westerngeco and wireline revenue on projects in the middle east  asia area north america land russia and mexico 

yearonyear pretax operating margin was essentially flat at 18 

drilling group

fullyear 2017 revenue of 84 billion decreased 2 yearonyear primarily due to the rig count declines internationally and in offshore north america combined with pricing pressure revenue also declined as a result of schlumberger’s decision in april 2016 to reduce its activities in venezuela to align operations with cash collections 

 

yearonyear pretax operating margin increased 210 bps to 14 primarily due to improved profitability in north america due to accelerated land activity and improved pricing this improvement was partially offset by the negative impact of reduced activity in venezuela

production group 

fullyear 2017 revenue of 106 billion increased 21 yearonyear with most of the revenue increase attributable to the accelerated land activity growth in north america that benefited the pressure pumping business which grew 44 lower schlumberger production management spm production levels in ecuador partially offset the revenue increase 

yearonyear pretax operating margin increased 297 bps to 9 as a result of improved profitability in north america due to the accelerated land activity and improved pricing this was partially offset by reduced margins in spm due to lower production in ecuador

cameron group 

the cameron group contributed fullyear revenue of 52 billion cameron group revenue for 2016 included only nine months of revenue following the closing of the acquisition in april 2016 revenue in 2017 was impacted by a declining project backlog particularly for the longcycle businesses of drilling systems and onesubsea

yearonyear pretax operating margin of 14 decreased 142 bps as a result of lower drilling systems project volumes 

 

 

fullyear 201 6 results 

 

 



 









fullyear 2016 revenue of 278 billion decreased 22 yearonyear this included nine months of activity from the cameron group which contributed 42 billion of revenue 

fullyear 2016 revenue from both the reservoir characterization and production groups declined by 30 as a result of lower demand for exploration and developmentrelated products and services as ep budgets were further reduced drilling group revenue fell 37 due to the rig count decline in both north america and internationally

fullyear 2016 pretax operating income margin decreased 658 bps to 12 as a result of the overall decline in activity and pervasive pricing concessions the margin decrease was highest in the reservoir characterization group which contracted by 699 bps to 19 drilling group pretax operating margin fell 710 bps to 12 while the production group decreased 687 bps to 6 the cameron group posted a pretax margin of 16

reservoir characterization group 

fullyear 2016 revenue of 67 billion decreased 30 yearonyear primarily due to sustained cuts in exploration and discretionary spending 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 699 bps to 19 due to reduced highmargin wireline and testing services activities

drilling group

fullyear 2016 revenue of 86 billion decreased 37 yearonyear primarily due to the severe drop in rig count in both north america and internationally combined with pricing pressure that mainly affected drilling  measurements and mi swaco activity 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 710 bps to 12 primarily due to the significant decline in highermargin activities of drilling  measurements combined with pricing weakness

 

production group 

fullyear 2016 revenue of 87 billion decreased 30 yearonyear with most of the decrease attributable to a decline in north america particularly on well services pressure pumping technologies driven by activity declines and pricing pressure as the land rig count declined dramatically 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 687 bps to 6 as a result of lower activity and increasing pricing pressure which continued to impact north america land

cameron group 

cameron group contributed ninemonth revenue of 42 billion and pretax operating margin of 16 revenue was impacted by a declining project backlog as well as a further slowdown in north america land activity which also affected the shortcycle businesses of the valves  measurement and surface product lines

pretax operating margin of 16 was driven by strong project execution and manufacturing efficiency in onesubsea and overall cost control across the group

 

interest and other income 

interest  other income consisted of the following 

 



 

the increase in interest income in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily attributable to the higher cash and shortterm investment balances as a result of the issuance of 60 billion of senior notes during the fourth quarter of 2015

the decrease in earnings of equity method investments in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily reflects the effects of the downturn in the oil and gas industry which has negatively impacted the majority of schlumberger’s investments in affiliates particularly those in north america this decrease also reflects the fact that schlumberger ceased recording equity income from the onesubsea joint venture in april 2016 as a result of schlumberger’s acquisition of cameron

interest expense 

interest expense of 566 million in 2017 was essentially flat as compared to 2016

interest expense of 570 million in 2016 increased by 224 million compared to 2015 primarily due to the issuance of 60 billion of senior notes during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the impact of the 30 billion of debt assumed in the acquisition of cameron 

other 

research  engineering and general  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  were as follows 

 



 

research  engineering costs have decreased in terms of both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016 as a result of cost control measures 

 

although research  engineering costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2016 as compared to 2015 they decreased in absolute dollar terms as a result of cost control measures that were implemented offset in part by the impact of the cameron acquisition

 

income taxes 

the schlumberger effective tax rate was 279 in 2017 146 in 2016 and 259 in 2015 

the schlumberger effective tax rate has historically been sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increased the schlumberger effective tax rate generally decreased conversely when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreased the schlumberger effective tax rate generally increased 

the effective tax rate for each of 2017 2016 and 2015 was significantly impacted by the charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements because they were only partially taxeffective excluding the impact of these charges and credits the effective tax rate was 182 in 2017 159 in 2016 and 202 in 2015 the increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 as compared to 2016 excluding the impact of charges and credits was primarily attributable to a change in the geographic mix of earnings as the percentage of pretax earnings generated in north america increased the decrease in the effective tax rate excluding the impact of charges and credits in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily attributed to the geographic mix of earnings and the favorable resolution of the tax examinations in certain jurisdictions 

as discussed in further detail in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” the act which is also commonly referred to as “us tax reform” significantly changes us corporate income tax laws by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 starting in 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of us subsidiaries

excluding the impact of any discrete items the provisions of the act are expected to reduce schlumberger’s effective tax rate in 2018 by approximately 2 to 3 percentage points compared to what the rate would have otherwise been in the absence of us tax reform the ultimate impact on schlumberger’s effective tax rate will largely depend on the percentage of pretax earnings that schlumberger generates in the us as compared to the rest of the world

charges and credits 

schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits during 2017 2016 and 2015 these charges and credits which are summarized below are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  

the following is a summary of the 2017 charges and credits of which 3211 billion were classified as impairments  other 245 million were classified as cost of sales and 308 million were classified as merger  integration in the consolidated statement of income loss

the following table summarizes the activity under this share repurchase program during 2017 2016 and 2015 

 



 



 







schlumberger’s international defined benefit pension plans were a combined 97 funded at december 31 2017 based on the projected benefit obligation this compares to 92 funded at december 31 2016 

schlumberger expects to contribute approximately 125 million to its postretirement benefit plans in 2018 subject to market and business conditions 



schlumberger maintains a €50 billion guaranteed euro medium term note program this program provides for the issuance of various types of debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in euro us dollar or other currencies schlumberger has issued €05 billion 150 guaranteed notes due 2019 under this program

as of december 31 2017 schlumberger had 51 billion of cash and shortterm investments on hand schlumberger also has separate committed credit facility agreements aggregating 66 billion with commercial banks of which 36 billion was available and unused as of december 31 2017 the 66 billion of committed credit facility agreements included 63 billion of committed facilities which support commercial paper programs schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months

the total outstanding commercial paper borrowings were 30 billion as of december 31 2017 and 26 billion as of december 31 2016 

summary of contractual obligations 









refer to note 18 pension and other benefit plans of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

as discussed in note 14 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2017 is approximately 14 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 

 

schlumberger has outstanding letters of creditguarantees that relate to business performance bonds customexcise tax commitments facility leaserental obligations etc these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are cu stomary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain 

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

multiclient seismic data 

schlumberger capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december 31 2017 and 2016 was 727 million and 107 billion respectively such costs are charged to cost of services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value 

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library surveys are primarily analyzed for impairment on a surveybysurvey basis 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices adjustments to the allowance may be required in future periods depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments

as a large multinational company with a long history of operating in a cyclical industry schlumberger has extensive experience in working with its customers during difficult times to manage its accounts receivable during weak economic environments or when there is an extended period of weakness in oil and gas prices schlumberger typically experiences delays in the payment of its receivables however except as described below schlumberger has not had material writeoffs due to uncollectible accounts receivable over the recent industry downturn schlumberger operates in more than 85 countries as of december 31 2017 only five of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5 of schlumberger’s net receivables balance of which only one the united states accounted for greater than 10 of such receivables

during the second quarter of 2017 schlumberger entered into a financing agreement with its primary customer in venezuela this agreement resulted in the exchange of 700 million of outstanding accounts receivable for promissory notes with a threeyear term that bear interest at the rate of 650 per annum schlumberger recorded these notes at their estimated fair value on the date of the exchange which resulted in a pretax and aftertax charge of 460 million as a result the cost basis of the promissory note was 240 million as of june 30 2017 

in april 2016 schlumberger announced that it was reducing its activity in venezuela to align operations with cash collections as a result of insufficient payments on outstanding receivables schlumberger also previously disclosed that its judgment regarding the collectibility of its receivables and promissory notes in venezuela is sensitive to the political and economic conditions in the country and that if conditions in venezuela worsen schlumberger may be required to record adjustments to the carrying value of these assets during the fourth quarter of 2017 conditions in venezuela further deteriorated such that schlumberger determined it was appropriate to writeoff the remaining outstanding receivable balance of approximately 469 million and record an impairment charge of 105 million related to the aforementioned promissory notes in order to writedown the cost basis of such notes to their estimated fair value as of december 31 2017

 

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill the goodwill relating to each of schlumberger’s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred 

under generally accepted accounting principles schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount there is no need to perform any further testing however if schlumberger concludes otherwise then it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded based on that difference 

schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test 

for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill schlumberger’s reporting units are its four groups reservoir characterization drilling production and cameron schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test in 2017 based on this assessment schlumberger concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying amount accordingly no further testing was required 

longlived assets including fixed assets intangible assets and investments in spm projects are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 

income taxes 

schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts schlumberger recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities that could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

percentageofcompletion revenue recognition

schlumberger uses the percentageofcompletion method to account for certain longterm constructiontype contracts these contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customerspecific applications under the percentageofcompletion method revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs

the estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims profits are recognized based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete due to the nature of these projects adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs are often required as work progresses any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable

 

approximately 7  of schlumberger’s revenue in 201 7 was recognized under the percentageofcompletion method 

pension and postretirement benefits 

schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements  the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate that schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of payment of the related benefit obligations the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans 









the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expected rates of return for the investment portfolio with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans was 725 in both 2017 and 2016 the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international pension plans was 740 in both 2017 and 2016 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine the 2017 postretirement medical expense was 725 graded to 50 over the next nine years the overall medical trend rate assumption utilized to determine the postretirement medical liability at december 31 2017 was 725 graded to 50 over the next nine years 

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for schlumberger’s united states and international pension plan

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger operates in more than 85 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar approximately 78 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2017 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will increase 

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on its earnings schlumberger enters into foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities and certain expenses denominated in currencies other than the functional currency

a 10 appreciation in the us dollar from the december 31 2017 market rates would increase the unrealized value of schlumberger’s forward contracts by 123 million conversely a 10 depreciation in the us dollar from the december 31 2017 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of schlumberger’s forward contracts by 74 million in either scenario the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future earnings

at december 31 2017 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 50 billion in various foreign currencies of which 18 billion related to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and occasionally interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2017 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 142 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately 40 billion before considering the effects of cross currency swaps 

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio shortterm investments which totaled approximately 33 billion at december 31 2017 is comprised primarily of money market funds time deposits certificates of deposit commercial paper bonds and notes substantially all of which are denominated in us dollars the average return on investments was 13 in 2017 

 

the following table reflects the carrying amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 201 7 by year of maturity 

 



 

the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 145 billion as of december 31 2017 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2017 was 23 

schlumberger does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors known to us contains important information for the understanding of our “forwardlooking statements” which are discussed immediately following item 7a of this form 10k and elsewhere these risk factors should also be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k 

we urge you to consider carefully the risks described below as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k if any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this form 10k were to materialize our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers the current significant oil and gas industry downturn has resulted in reduced demand for oilfield services which has had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows if these conditions worsen or oil and gas prices do not improve it could have a further material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by our customers for the exploration development and production of oil and natural gas reserves these expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ views of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to our customers’ views of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas since 2014 oil and gas prices have declined significantly resulting in lower expenditures by our customers as a result many of our customers have reduced or delayed their oil and gas exploration and production spending reducing the demand for our products and services and exerting downward pressure on the prices that we charge these conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our financial condition 

 

the continued low oil and gas prices have caused a reduction in cash flows for our customers which has had a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of some of our customers this has resulted  in and may continue to result in  project modifications delays and cancellations general business disruptions and delays in payment of or nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us these effects could ha ve a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors including 























there can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas will follow historic patterns or recover meaningfully in the near term continued or worsening conditions in the oil and gas industry could have a further material adverse affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonunited states operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the over 85 countries in which we operate 

our nonunited states operations accounted for approximately 80 of our consolidated revenue in 2016 76 in 2015 and 71 in 2014 operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 























our failure to comply with complex us and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations

we are subject to complex us and foreign laws and regulations such as the fcpa the uk bribery act and various other antibribery and anticorruption laws we are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to and certain operations in various countries or with certain persons our ability to transfer people and products among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations the internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or violating applicable laws and regulations any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of antibribery trade 

 

control trade sanctions or anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financi al condition violations of international and us laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct and could have a material advers e effect on our reputation and our business operating results and financial condition 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 

we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials chemicals and explosives and to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions hydraulic fracturing water discharges and waste management we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex stringent and expensive to implement these laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

we could be subject to substantial liability claims which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health safety and environmental risks our offerings involve productionrelated activities radioactive materials chemicals explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration development and production environments an accident involving these services or equipment or a failure of a product could cause personal injury loss of life damage to or destruction of property equipment or the environment or suspension of operations our insurance may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events including events involving pollution or against losses resulting from business interruption moreover we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation or regulations 

environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the united states and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gasses and their potential role in climate change existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services this may in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

some international national state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in lowpermeability reservoirs specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated causing cracks in the target formation proppant such as sand of a particular size is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete future hydraulic fracturingrelated legislation or regulations could limit or ban hydraulic fracturing or lead to operational delays and increased costs and therefore reduce demand for our pressure pumping services if such additional international national state or local legislation or regulations are enacted it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain technology leadership this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold 

the oilfield service industry is highly competitive our ability to continually provide competitive technology and services can impact our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our services maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers if we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in the various markets we serve it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property righ ts including our trade secrets could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold 

some of our products or services and the processes we use to produce or provide them have been granted patent protection have patent applications pending or are trade secrets our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business royalty payments under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs additionally developing noninfringing technologies would increase our costs if a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations 

we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases in periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals this could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations 

severe weather conditions may adversely affect our operations 

our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate this may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services in addition if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures this may result in a suspension of activities any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cybersecurity risks and threats could adversely affect our business

we rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks or to avoid a material impact on our systems when such incidents or attacks do occur if our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks are circumvented or breached this could result in the loss of our intellectual property or other proprietary information including customer data and disruption of our business operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements including without limitation statements relating to our plans strategies objectives expectations intentions and resources such forwardlooking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under “item 1a risk factors” of this form 10k 

2016 executive overview 

on april 1 2016 schlumberger completed its acquisition of cameron combining their complementary portfolios into a poretopipeline products and services offering for the world’s oil and gas industry the transaction enables the creation of technologydriven growth by integrating schlumberger reservoir and well technology with cameron wellhead and surface equipment flow control and processing technology

schlumberger revenue of 278 billion in 2016 represented a decrease of 22 from 2015 despite three quarters of activity from the acquired cameron group which contributed 42 billion in revenue excluding the cameron group revenue declined 34 this revenue drop was due to continued weakness in exploration and production spending as a result of the deepest and longest industry crisis in more than 30 years 

the year began with brent crude prices experiencing the sharpest fall in 30 years to 26 per barrel in january 2016 thus continuing the downturn that the oil and gas industry endured during the previous year 

given two successive years of investment cuts oil supply growth slowed significantly despite record opec production nonopec production fell sharply largely due to a significant drop in us light tight oil production however robust global demand enabled the oil markets to tighten and draw down on the vast accumulation of crude and product stocks by midyear 

the year’s end was marked by opec and certain nonopec countries including russia agreeing to cut production by a combined 17 million barrels per day these agreements are expected to accelerate the drawdown of stocks in 2017 and have subsequently spurred a recovery in oil prices which reached 55 per barrel at the end of 2016

in the natural gas markets us production declined during 2016 as a result of the drop in gas drilling activity while demand growth was robust throughout the year low gas prices during most of 2016 encouraged the power sector to continue to favor gas over coal the year was also marked by the startup of the sabine pass liquefied natural gas lng plant in texas which exported its first shipment in early 2016 thus starting a trend that should make the us the third largest exporter of lng by the end of 2020 

europe continued to see modest demand growth due in part to coal plant retirements gas prices however fell to a sevenyear low as supplies from russia norway and north africa reached record highs the asian markets continued to be in slow growth mode albeit with slight improvements in china nonetheless oversupply persisted as australian lng exports ramped up driving lng prices down even further from the already lowlevels of 2015 the global outlook for lng is largely unchanged with continued oversupply and low prices

schlumberger’s financial performance in 2016 was severely impacted by the significant decrease in landbased activity particularly in north america where the average land rig count dropped 46 as compared to the previous year supply overcapacity in the land market remained high for most of 2016 resulting in pricing pressure across a broad range of oilfield services as a result north america revenue excluding the impact of the cameron group declined 48 due to a decrease in us land revenue of 52 including the cameron group north america revenue decreased 32 internationally revenue declined 28 excluding the impact of cameron 17 including the cameron group due to customer budget cuts activity disruptions and a shift in revenue mix that impacted schlumberger’s results in most basins and market segments around the world revenue in the europe cis  africa area decreased due to lower demand for exploration and developmentrelated products and services as ep budgets were reduced particularly in subsaharan africa in latin america revenue declined due to customer budget constraints across the area and more specifically in venezuela where operations were scaled back to align with collections middle east  asia revenue decreased primarily due to reduced activity in asiapacific countries while robust activity in the middle east was more than offset by pricing concessions

since the start of this downturn and as it deepened during 2016 schlumberger has navigated the commercial landscape by balancing pricing concessions and market share and also by proactively removing significant costs through workforce reductions internal efficiency improvements and strong supply chain management as a result schlumberger has delivered superior financial results by maintaining pretax operating margins well above 10 and delivering sufficient free cash flow to cover a range of strategic capital investments as well as our ongoing dividend commitments

 

after nine quarters of unprecedented activity decline the business environment stabilized in the third quarter of 2016 and revenue increased slightly in the fourth quarter suggesting that the bottom of this cycle has been reached 

schlumberger expects the growth in ep investments in 2017 to be led initially by land operators in north america ep spending surveys currently indicate that 2017 ep investments in north america will increase by approximately 30 which should lead to both higher activity and a recovery in service industry pricing 

schlumberger expects the 2017 recovery in the international markets to proceed more slowly than in north america this will likely lead to a third successive year of underinvestment with a continued low rate of new project approvals and an accelerating production decline in the aging production base these factors taken together are increasing the likelihood of a significant supply deficit in the medium term which can only be avoided by a broadbased global increase in ep spending which is expected to start unfolding in the later parts of 2017 and leading into 2018

fourth quarter 2016 results 

 



 









 

fourthquarter revenue of 71 billion increased 1 sequentially this increase was primarily driven by the production group which grew 5 due to increased hydraulic fracturing activity in the middle east and in north america land 

fourthquarter pretax operating margin was essentially flat sequentially at 114 as margin improvements in the production and drilling groups were balanced by contractions in the cameron and reservoir characterization groups

reservoir characterization group 

fourthquarter revenue of 17 billion increased 1 sequentially due to the rampup in testing  process activity in kuwait and increased software license and maintenance sales these effects were slightly offset by the seasonal decrease in wireline activity in norway and russia 

p retax operating margin of 19 decreased 49 basis points bps sequentially as the increased contribution from software and maintenance sales was more than offset by the decline in highmargin wireline activities 

 

drilling group 

fourthquarter revenue of 20 billion was flat sequentially as the continued strong directional drilling activity in north america land was offset by lower drilling activity in the international areas the improvement in north america revenue primarily came from increased uptake of drilling  measurements bits  drilling tools technologies the lower revenue in the international areas was primarily due to completed drilling  measurement projects while the winter slowdown in russia and norway affected drilling  measurements and mi swaco activity

pretax operating margin of 12 expanded 81 bps sequentially despite revenue being flat this was largely due to pricing improvements from greater uptake of drilling technologies on increasing activity on land in the us which mainly affected drilling  measurements and bits  drilling tools 

production group

fourthquarter revenue of 22 billion increased 5 sequentially as a result of strong fracturing activity on unconventional resource developments on land in the middle east mainly in saudi arabia and in north america where the land rig count and fracturing stage count increased revenue on land in the us increased both on volume and on a modest pricing recovery 

pretax operating margin of 6 increased 134 bps sequentially on increased activity which drove efficiency and better operational execution in the middle east the modest pricing recovery on land in the us also contributed to the margin expansion

cameron group

fourthquarter revenue of 13 billion was flat sequentially among the group’s businesses onesubsea reported an 11 sequential increase from strong project activity and execution while surface systems posted strong sales in the middle east these increases however were offset by a decline in revenue in drilling systems driven by a declining backlog and lower bookings valves  measurement was also lower following the prior quarter’s strong international shipments  

pretax operating margin of 14 declined 207 bps sequentially due to the drop in highmargin drilling systems project volume

 

fullyear 2016 results 

 



 









 

fullyear 2016 revenue of  278 billion decreased 22  yearonyear this included nine months of activity from the acquired cameron group which contributed  42 billion of revenue 

fullyear 2016 revenue from the reservoir characterization and production groups declined by 31 and 29 respectively as a result of lower demand for exploration and developmentrelated products and services as ep budgets were further reduced drilling group revenue fell 37 due to the rig count decline in both north america and internationally

fullyear 2016 pretax operating income margin decreased 658 bps to 12 as a result of the overall decline in activity and pervasive pricing concessions the margin decrease was highest in the reservoir characterization group which contracted by 710 bps to 18 drilling group pretax operating margin fell 710 bps to 12 while the production group decreased 669 bps to 6 the cameron group posted a pretax margin of 16

reservoir characterization group 

fullyear 2016 revenue of 67 billion decreased 31 yearonyear primarily due to sustained cuts in exploration and discretionary spending 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 710 bps to 18 due to reduced highmargin wireline and testing services activities

drilling group

fullyear 2016 revenue of 86 billion decreased 37 yearonyear primarily due to the severe drop in rig count in both north america and internationally combined with pricing pressure that mainly affected drilling  measurements and mi swaco activity 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 710 bps to 12 primarily due to the significant decline in highermargin activities of drilling  measurements combined with pricing weakness

production group 

fullyear 2016 revenue of 87 billion decreased 29 yearonyear with most of the decrease attributable to a decline in north america particularly on well services pressure pumping technologies driven by activity declines and pricing pressure as the land rig count declined dramatically 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 669 bps to 6 as a result of lower activity and increasing pricing pressure which continued to impact north america land

cameron group 

cameron group contributed ninemonth revenue of 42 billion and pretax operating margin of 16 revenue was impacted by a declining project backlog as well as a further slowdown in north america land activity which also affected the shortcycle businesses of the valves  measurement and surface product lines

pretax operating margin of 16 was driven by strong project execution and manufacturing efficiency in onesubsea and overall cost control across the group

 

fullyear 2015 results 

 

 



 









fullyear 2015 revenue of 355 billion decreased 27 yearonyear this decrease was primarily due to customer budget cuts and pricing concessions as customers responded to lower commodity prices revenue was also impacted by the fall of certain currencies against the us dollar which accounted for approximately 20 of the revenue decline

fullyear 2015 revenue from the reservoir characterization and drilling groups declined by 27 and 25 respectively as a result of lower demand as ep budgets were reduced due to lower commodity prices production group revenue fell by 29 due to activity reductions and pricing pressure as the land rig count dropped drastically in north america

fullyear 2015 pretax operating income margin decreased 342 bps to 18 as a result of the overall decline in activity combined with the pricing pressure which most notably impacted the businesses in north america

reservoir characterization group 

fullyear 2015 revenue of 97 billion was 27 lower than the same period last year primarily due to sustained customer cuts in exploration and discretionary spending that impacted all technologies

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 295 bps to 25 as a result of an unfavorable overall revenue mix reflecting the decline in highmargin exploration activity as well as lower highmargin multiclient and software sales

drilling group 

fullyear 2015 revenue of 136 billion was 25 lower than the previous year primarily due to the severe drop in rig count in north america reduced activity levels and service pricing concessions internationally  unfavorable currency effects in russia and venezuela also contributed to the decline 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 228 bps to 19 primarily due to a decrease in highermargin activities of drilling  measurements as well as pricing concessions despite the revenue decline prompt action on cost management and the benefit of a local cost structure that minimized the impact of unfavorable currency effects on pretax operating income helped limit the operating margin decline

 

production group 

fullyear 2015 revenue of 123 billion decreased 29 yearonyear with approximately twothirds of the decline attributable to well services pressure pumping technologies as a result of activity reductions and pricing pressure as the land rig count declined dramatically in north america 

yearonyear pretax operating margin declined 531 bps to 13 as lower activity and increasing pricing pressure continued in north america land 

 

interest and other income 

interest  other income consisted of the following 

 



 

the increase in interest income in 2016 as compared to 2015 and 2014 is primarily attributable to the higher cash and shortterm investment balances as a result of the issuance of 60 billion of senior notes during the fourth quarter of 2015

the decrease in earnings of equity method investments primarily reflects the effects of the downturn in the oil and gas industry which has negatively impacted the majority of schlumberger’s investments in affiliates particularly those in north america the decrease in 2016 also reflects the fact that schlumberger stopped recording equity income from the onesubsea joint venture in april 2016 as a result of schlumberger’s acquisition of cameron

interest expense 

interest expense of 570 million in 2016 increased by 224 million compared to 2015 primarily due to the issuance of 60 billion of senior notes during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the impact of the 30 billion of debt assumed in the acquisition of cameron

interest expense of 346 million in 2015 decreased by 23 million compared to 2014 as the impact of a higher weighted average debt balance of approximately 05 billion was more than offset by a 30 bps decrease in the weighted average borrowing rates from 28 in 2014 to 25 in 2015 

other 

research  engineering and general  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  were as follows 

 



 

although research  engineering and general  administrative costs have either increased or remained flat as a percentage of revenue in 2016 as compared to 2015 they have decreased in absolute dollar terms as a result of cost control measures that have been implemented offset in part by the impact of the cameron acquisition

income taxes 

the schlumberger effective tax rate was 146 in 2016 259 in 2015 and 252 in 2014 

the schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease conversely when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase 

 

the effective tax rate for each of 2016  201 5 and 201 4 was significantly impacted by the charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolida ted financial statements because they were only partially tax effective  excluding the impact of these charges and credits the effective tax rate was 159  in 201 6  202  in 201 5 and 219  in 201 4  the decrease in the effective tax rate excluding the impact of charges and credits was primarily attributable to a change in the geographic mix of earnings and the favorable resolution of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions  

it is expected that the effective tax rate will gradually increase over the course of 2017 as a result of the expected improvement in activity in north america

key liquidity events during 2016 2015 and 2014 included 

 









in order to partially fund the purchase of the 138 million shares of common stock from schlumberger limited that were transferred to cameron stockholders shc issued 6 billion of notes during the fourth quarter of 2015 consisting of the following













the following table summarizes the activity under this share repurchase program during 2016 2015 and 2014 

 



 

 

on january 21 2016 the board approved a new 10 billion share repurchase program for schlumberger common stock this new program will take effect once the remaining  06 billion authorized to be repurchased under the july 18 2013 program is exhausted 

 



on january 15 2015 schlumberger announced that the board approved a 25 increase in the quarterly dividend to 050 per share 





schlumberger’s international defined benefit pension plans were a combined 92 funded at december 31 2016 based on the projected benefit obligation this compares to 93 funded at december 31 2015 

schlumberger expects to contribute approximately 200 million to its postretirement benefit plans in 2017 subject to market and business conditions 

in april 2016 schlumberger announced that it would reduce its activity in venezuela to align operations with cash collections as a result of insufficient payments received in recent quarters and a lack of progress in establishing new mechanisms that address past and future accounts receivable schlumberger continues to experience delays in payment from its national oil company customer in venezuela venezuela represented less than 5 of schlumberger’s consolidated revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 schlumberger’s net receivable balance in venezuela as of december 31 2016 was approximately 12 billion

although accounts receivable collections improved during the fourth quarter of 2016 schlumberger continues to experience payment delays from many of its customers this is attributable to the impact of lower oil and gas prices on the industry in this regard ecuador now represents approximately 12 of schlumberger’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2016

schlumberger operates in more than 85 countries at december 31 2016 only five of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5 of schlumberger’s accounts receivable balances of which only three the united states ecuador and venezuela accounted for greater than 10

schlumberger maintains a €50 billion guaranteed euro medium term note program this program provides for the issuance of various types of debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in euro us dollar or other currencies schlumberger has issued €05 billion 150 guaranteed notes due 2019 under this program

as of december 31 2016 schlumberger had 93 billion of cash and shortterm investments on hand schlumberger also has separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating 66 billion with commercial banks of which 40 billion was available and unused as of december 31 2016 the 66 billion of committed debt facility agreements included 63 billion of committed facilities which support commercial paper programs schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months

the total outstanding commercial paper borrowings were 2571 billion as of december 31 2016 and 2383 billion as of december 31 2015 

summary of contractual obligations 





 





refer to note 18 pension and other benefit plans of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

as discussed in note 14 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2016 is approximately 14 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 

schlumberger has outstanding letters of creditguarantees that relate to business performance bonds customexcise tax commitments facility leaserental obligations etc these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain 

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

multiclient seismic data 

schlumberger capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december 31 2016 and 2015 was 107 billion and 103 billion respectively such costs are charged to cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value 

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library larger surveys which are typically prefunded by customers are analyzed for impairment on a surveybysurvey basis and smaller surveys are analyzed based on two pools of surveys united states and nonunited states the united states and nonunited states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments adjustments to the allowance may be required 

 

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill the goodwill relating to each of schlumberger’s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred 

under generally accepted accounting principles schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount there is no need to perform any further testing however if schlumberger concludes otherwise then it is required to perform the first step of a twostep impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test 

for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill schlumberger’s reporting units are its four groups reservoir characterization drilling production and cameron schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test in 2016 based on this assessment schlumberger concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying amount accordingly no further testing was required 

longlived assets including fixed assets intangible assets and investments in spm projects are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 

income taxes 

schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts schlumberger recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities that could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

percentageofcompletion revenue recognition

schlumberger uses the percentageofcompletion method to account for certain longterm constructiontype contracts primarily in the cameron group these contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customerspecific applications under the percentageofcompletion method revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs

the estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims profits are recognized based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete due to the nature of these projects adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs are often required as work progresses any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable

 

approximately 6  of schlumberger’s revenue in 2 016 was recognized under the percentageofcompletion method 

pension and postretirement benefits 

schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements  the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate that schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of payment of the related benefit obligations the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans 









the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expected rates of return for the investment portfolio with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans was 725 in both 2016 and 2015 the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international pension plans was 740 in both 2016 and 2015 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine the 2016 postretirement medical expense was 750 graded to 50 over the next ten years the overall medical trend rate assumption utilized to determine the postretirement medical liability at december 31 2016 was 725 graded to 50 over the next ten years 

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for schlumberger’s united states and international pension plan

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger operates in more than 85 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar approximately 77 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2016 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will increase 

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on its earnings schlumberger enters into foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities and certain expenses denominated in currencies other than the functional currency

a 10 appreciation in the us dollar from the december 31 2016 market rates would increase the unrealized value of schlumberger’s forward contracts by 47 million conversely a 10 depreciation in the us dollar from the december 31 2016 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of schlumberger’s forward contracts by 57 million in either scenario the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future earnings

at december 31 2016 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 55 billion in various foreign currencies of which 11 billion related to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and occasionally interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2016 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 147 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately 49 billion before considering the effects of cross currency swaps 

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio both shortterm investments and fixed income investments  held to maturity  which totaled approximately 66 billion at december 31 2016 are comprised primarily of money market funds time deposits certificates of deposit commercial paper bonds and notes substantially all of which are denominated in us dollars the average return on investments was 09 in 2016 

 

the following table reflects the carrying amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 2016 by year of maturity 

 



 

the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 150 billion as of december 31 2016 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2016 was 17 

schlumberger does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes

founded in 1926 schlumberger is the world’s leading supplier of technology integrated project management and information solutions to the international oil and gas exploration and production industry having invented wireline logging as a technique for obtaining downhole data in oil and gas wells schlumberger today provides the industry’s widest range of products and services from exploration through production as of december 31 2015 the company employed approximately 95000 people of over 140 nationalities operating in approximately 85 countries schlumberger has principal executive offices in paris houston london and the hague 

on august 26 2015 schlumberger and cameron international corporations cameron jointly announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement in which cameron will merge with an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of schlumberger in a stock and cash transaction under the terms of the agreement cameron shareholders will receive 0716 shares of schlumberger common stock and a cash payment of 1444 in exchange for each cameron share of common stock outstanding schlumberger estimates that it will issue approximately 137 million shares of its common stock and pay cash of approximately 28 billion in connection with this transaction in november 2015 the us department of justice cleared the proposed merger without any conditions on december 17 2015 cameron stockholders voted to adopt the proposed merger however the transaction remains subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions it is anticipated that the closing of the transaction will occur in the first quarter of 2016 

cameron designs manufactures markets and services equipment used by the oil and gas industry and industrial manufacturing companies cameron is a leading international manufacturer of oil and gas pressure control and separation equipment including valves wellheads controls chokes blowout preventers and assembled systems for oil and gas drilling production and transmission used in onshore offshore and subsea applications and provides oil and gas separation metering and flow measurement equipment cameron reported revenue of 104 billion for the year ended december 31 2014 

schlumberger operates in each of the major oilfield service markets managing its business through three groups reservoir characterization drilling and production each group consists of a number of technologybased service and product lines or technologies these technologies cover the entire life cycle of the reservoir and correspond to a number of markets in which schlumberger holds leading positions the business is also reported through four geographic areas north america latin america europecisafrica and middle east  asia within these areas a network of geomarket regions provides logistical technical and commercial coordination 

the role of the groups and technologies is to support schlumberger in providing the best possible service to customers and that it remains at the forefront of technology development the groups and technologies are collectively responsible for driving excellence in execution throughout their businesses overseeing operational processes resource allocation personnel and delivering superior financial results the geomarket structure offers customers a single point of contact at the local level for field operations and brings together geographically focused teams to meet local needs and deliver customized solutions the areas and geomarkets are responsible for providing the most efficient and cost effective support possible to the operations

the groups are as follows

reservoir characterization group – consists of the principal technologies involved in finding and defining hydrocarbon resources these include westerngeco wireline testing services software integrated solutions sis and integrated services management ism 

 









 





drilling group – consists of the principal technologies involved in the drilling and positioning of oil and gas wells and comprises bits  drilling tools mi swaco drilling  measurements land rigs and integrated drilling services 

 











production group – consists of the principal technologies involved in the lifetime production of oil and gas reservoirs and includes well services completions artificial lift well intervention water services integrated production services and schlumberger production management 

 















spm commercial arrangements create alignment between schlumberger and the asset holder andor the operator whereby schlumberger receives remuneration in line with its value creation these projects are generally focused on developing and comanaging production of schlumberger’s customers’ assets under longterm agreements schlumberger will invest its own services and products and in some cases cash into the field development activities and operations although in certain arrangements schlumberger is paid for a portion of the services or products it provides generally schlumberger will not be paid at the time of providing its services or upon delivery of its products instead schlumberger is generally compensated based upon cash flow generated or on a feeperbarrel basis this may include certain arrangements whereby schlumberger is only compensated based upon incremental production that it helps deliver above a mutually agreed baseline

schlumberger also has a 40 equity ownership interest in onesubsea tm  a joint venture with cameron the joint venture manufactures and develops products systems and services for the subsea oil and gas market schlumberger’s 40 share of the net income of the joint venture is reflected in the results of the production group

 

supporting the technologies is a global network of research and engineering centers through this organization schlumberger is committed to advanced technology programs that enhance oilfield efficiency lower finding and producing costs improv e productivity maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value while accomplishing these goals in a safe and environmentally sound manner 

schlumberger primarily uses its own personnel to market its offerings the customer base business risks and opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all services there is a sharing of manufacturing and engineering facilities as well as research centers and the labor force is interchangeable technological innovation quality of service and price differentiation are the principal methods of competition which vary geographically with respect to the different services offered while there are numerous competitors both large and small schlumberger believes that it is an industry leader in providing geophysical services wireline logging well testing exploration and production software drilling and completion fluids solids and waste management coiledtubing drill bits measurementwhiledrilling loggingwhiledrilling directional drilling services and mud logging a large proportion of schlumberger offerings is nonrig related consequently revenue does not necessarily correlate to the rig count

general 

intellectual property 

schlumberger owns and controls a variety of intellectual property including but not limited to patents proprietary information and software tools and applications that in the aggregate are material to schlumberger’s business while schlumberger seeks and holds numerous patents covering various products and processes no particular patent or group of patents is considered material to schlumberger’s business 

seasonality 

seasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of oilfield services for example the spring thaw in canada and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels while the winter months in the north sea russia and china can produce severe weather conditions that typically result in temporarily reduced levels of activity in addition hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations furthermore customer spending patterns for multiclient data software and other oilfield services and products generally result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of each year as clients seek to utilize their annual budgets 

customers and backlog of orders 

for the year ended december 31 2015 no single customer exceeded 10 of consolidated revenue other than westerngeco schlumberger has no significant backlog due to the nature of its businesses the westerngeco backlog which is based on signed contracts with customers was 11 billion at december 31 2015 07 billion at december 31 2014

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors known to us contains important information for the understanding of our “forwardlooking statements” which are discussed immediately following item 7a of this form 10k and elsewhere these risk factors should also be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k 

we urge you to consider carefully the risks described below as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k if any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this form 10k were to materialize our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry the current significant oil and gas industry downturn has resulted in reduced demand for oilfield services which has had and may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows if these conditions worsen or oil and gas prices do not improve further reductions in spending by the oil and gas industry could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration development and production of oil and natural gas reserves these expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas since 2014 oil and gas prices have declined significantly resulting in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry as a result many of our customers have reduced or delayed their oil and gas exploration and production spending reducing the demand for our services and exerting downward pressure on the prices that we charge these conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our financial condition 

continued low oil and gas prices or a further decline in oil and gas prices could cause a reduction in cash flows for our customers which could have significant adverse effects on the financial condition of some of our customers this could result in project modifications delays or cancellations general business disruptions and delays in payment of or nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us these effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors including 























there can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas will follow historic patterns or recover in the near term continued or worsening conditions in the oil and gas industry could further adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonunited states operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 85 countries in which we operate 

our nonunited states operations accounted for approximately 76 of our consolidated revenue in 2015 71 in 2014 and 73 in 2013 operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 























we completed the wind down of our service operations in iran during the second quarter of 2013 prior to this certain of our nonus subsidiaries provided oilfield services to the national iranian oil company and certain of its affiliates “nioc” we have reclassified the results of this business as a discontinued operation all prior periods have been restated accordingly 

our residual transactions or dealings with the government of iran during 2015 consisted of payments of taxes and other typical governmental charges certain of our nonus subsidiaries maintained depository accounts at the dubai branch of bank saderat iran “saderat” and at bank tejarat “tejarat” in tehran and in kish for the deposit by nioc of amounts owed to nonus subsidiaries of schlumberger for prior services rendered in iran and for the maintenance of such amounts previously received one nonus subsidiary also maintains an account at tejarat for payment of local expenses such as taxes and utilities we anticipate that we will discontinue our dealings with saderat and tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to us for prior services rendered in iran 

our failure to comply with foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and other laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations

we are subject to complex us and foreign laws and regulations such as the fcpa the uk bribery act and various other antibribery and anticorruption laws we are also subject to trade sanction laws that restrict certain operations in various countries or with certain persons the internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of antibribery or anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition violations of international and us laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business operating results and financial condition

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 

we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials chemicals and explosives and to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions hydraulic fracturing water discharges and waste management we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex stringent and expensive to implement these laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws and regulations the 

 

discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

we could be subject to substantial liability claims which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health safety and environmental risks our offerings involve productionrelated activities radioactive materials chemicals explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration development and production environments an accident involving these services or equipment or a failure of a product could cause personal injury loss of life damage to or destruction of property equipment or the environment or suspension of operations our insurance may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events including events involving pollution or against losses resulting from business interruption moreover we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation or regulations 

environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the united states and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gasses and their potential role in climate change existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services this may in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

some international national state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in lowpermeability reservoirs specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated causing cracks in the target formation proppant such as sand of a particular size is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete future hydraulic fracturingrelated legislation or regulations could limit or ban hydraulic fracturing or lead to operational delays and increased costs and therefore reduce demand for our pressure pumping services if such additional international national state or local legislation or regulations are enacted it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain technology leadership this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold 

the oilfield service industry is highly competitive our ability to continually provide competitive technology and services can impact our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our services maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers if we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in the various markets we serve it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights including our trade secrets could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold 

some of our products or services and the processes we use to produce or provide them have been granted patent protection have patent applications pending or are trade secrets our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business royalty payments under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs additionally developing noninfringing technologies would increase our costs if a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations 

we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases in periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals this could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations 

severe weather conditions may affect our operations 

our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate this may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services in addition if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures this may result in a suspension of activities any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cybersecurity risks and threats could affect our business

we rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks or to avoid a material impact on our systems when such incidents or attacks do occur if our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks are circumvented or breached this could result in the loss of our intellectual property or other proprietary information including customer data and disruption of our business operations

our ability to complete the proposed merger with cameron is subject to various closing conditions and the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities which may impose conditions that could materially adversely affect cameron or schlumberger or cause the merger to be abandoned

the merger agreement contains certain closing conditions including approval of the proposed merger by cameron stockholders the absence of injunctions or other legal restrictions and that no material adverse effect shall have occurred with respect to either company on december 17 2015 cameron stockholders voted to adopt our proposed merger also in november 2015 the us department of justice cleared our proposed merger without any conditions however we will be unable to complete the merger until consents and approvals are received from the european commission and various other governmental entities regulatory entities have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations and may impose certain requirements or obligations as conditions for their approval the merger agreement may require us to accept conditions from these regulators that could adversely affect the combined company if the regulatory clearances are not received or they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions set forth in the merger agreement then we will not be obligated to complete the merger we can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the necessary approvals will be obtained or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined company following the merger in addition we can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the merger

failure to complete the proposed merger with cameron could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results

if the proposed merger is not completed our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we would be subject to several risks including a decline in the market price of our common stock negative customer perception and diversion of management’s focus on pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to us in each case without realizing any of the benefits that might have resulted had the merger been completed

multiple lawsuits have been filed against us and cameron challenging the proposed merger and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the merger from being completed

after the announcement of the proposed merger four putative class action lawsuits were commenced on behalf of stockholders of cameron against cameron and its directors as well as against us and schlumberger holding corporation and rain merger sub both of which are indirect whollyowned subsidiaries these lawsuits were consolidated for all purposes and a consolidated amended class action complaint the “consolidated complaint” was filed the consolidated complaint seeks various remedies including enjoining the merger from being consummated rescission of the merger to the extent already implemented and the plaintiffs’ costs and fees additional lawsuits with similar allegations may be filed while we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against such claims the outcome of any such litigation is inherently uncertain one of the conditions to the closing of the merger is that no law order injunction judgment decree ruling or other similar requirement shall be in effect that prohibits the completion of the merger accordingly if any of the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the completion of the merger then that injunction may prevent the merger from becoming effective or delay its becoming effective

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger

the success of the proposed merger will depend on among other things our ability to combine our business with that of cameron in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated synergies however we must successfully combine both businesses in a manner that permits these benefits to be realized in addition we must achieve the anticipated synergies without 

 

adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully  may take longer to realize than expected  or may never be realized  

potential issues and difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following











business issues currently faced by cameron may impact our operations

to the extent that cameron currently has or is perceived by customers to have operational challenges such as ontime performance safety issues or workforce issues those challenges may raise concerns by our existing customers following the merger which may limit or impede our future ability to obtain additional work from those customers

the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements including without limitation statements relating to our plans strategies objectives expectations intentions and resources such forwardlooking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under “item 1a risk factors” of this form 10k 

executive overview 

schlumberger revenue of 355 billion in 2015 represented a drop of 27 from 2014 due to customer spending falling as commodity prices weakened during the year revenue in north america decreased 39 driven by a land rig count that ended the year 68 lower than the peak seen in 2014 as well as by pricing pressure that intensified during the year north american offshore revenue fell more modestly as rigs in the us gulf of mexico shifted from exploration to development work although the overall market in north america was the weakest for oilfield services since 1986 internationally revenue declined 21 as customers cut budgets and pressured service pricing with these effects often exacerbated by activity disruptions project delays and cancellations

in the oil markets the negative sentiments that had dominated the year accelerated during the fourth quarter after some early optimism earlier in the summer the impact of opec lifting production targets to produce at maximum rates combined with production in north america from unconventional resources declining slower than expected following the april peak has led to supply continuing to exceed increasing demand as a result commodity prices fell dramatically with oil dropping to a 12year low by the end of the year these weaker fundamentals drove industry exploration and production ep capital investment significantly lower resulting in the first twoyear sequential decline in spend in 30 years

in the natural gas markets us production grew to a record of 75 bcfd as new fields in the us gulf of mexico were brought into production and supplies from unconventional shale gas and tight oil reservoirs continued to grow this trend is expected to continue with newly completed pipeline capacity in the northeast united states bringing new supplies a relatively mild start to the winter together with north american gas storage levels well above the fiveyear average will keep natural gas prices low internationally european gas demand growth returned to positive territory despite this increased demand storage levels are at record highs due to ample supply from the north sea and russia as well as from liquefied natural gas lng demand rebounded in asia but remained in a downward trend overall as lng exports from australia grow the region is likely to remain oversupplied with low natural gas prices persisting

schlumberger’s financial performance in 2015 was significantly impacted by the large decrease in land activity particularly in the us where the yearend land rig count was less than 700 rigs this created massive overcapacity in the land market that impacted pricing levels across a broad range of oilfield services internationally revenue in the europe cis  africa area fell by 26 as a result of the weakening russian ruble and due to a drop in exploration activities in the united kingdom and norway geomarkets in latin america revenue declined 22 due to decreased activity in mexico brazil and colombia as a result of sustained budget cuts that led to rig count reductions middle east  asia area revenue decreased 17 on lower activity in the asia pacific region particularly in australia although this was partially offset by robust activity in the gulf cooperation council countries particularly saudi arabia kuwait and oman 

among the groups reservoir characterization performance was negatively impacted by sustained cuts in exploration spending currency weaknesses and operational disruptions from exhausted customer budgets that affected wireline activities particularly in the europe cis  africa and middle east  asia areas in the drilling group the drop in drilling activity coupled with persistent pricing pressure currency weaknesses and operational disruptions lowered drilling  measurements and mi swaco revenues across all geographies but most significantly in the europe cis  africa area production group performance was mainly affected by the fall in north american land activity as exhausted customer budgets led to a continued decline in rig count and increased pricing pressure 

in this uncertain environment schlumberger continues to focus on what it can control throughout the year schlumberger took a number of actions to streamline and resize its organization as it continues to navigate the current market downturn in spite of current conditions schlumberger remains constructive in its view of the market outlook in the medium term and continues to believe that the underlying balance of supply and demand will tighten driven by growth in demand weakening supply as the massive ep investment cuts take effect and by the size of the annual supply replacement challenge

pretax operating margin of 167 contracted 173 bps sequentially as revenue declined on pricing weakness and abrupt operational disruptions

production group 

fourthquarter revenue of 27 billion decreased 10 sequentially with 80 of the decrease attributable to a further decline in north american land activity as exhausted customer budgets led to a further decline in rig count and increased pricing pressure market pricing for pressure pumping services dropped to even more unsustainable levels 

pretax operating margin of 113 increased 24 bps sequentially despite lower activity and increasing pricing weakness in pressure pumping services the decline in pressure pumping margin was largely offset by the combination of accretive margin contributions from schlumberger production management projects in latin america and higher net earnings from the onesubsea joint venture

internationally revenue decreased 21 yearonyear due to customer budget cuts and service pricing concessions as customers responded to lower commodity prices revenue was also impacted by the fall of certain currencies against the us dollar which accounted for more than onethird of the revenue decline europecisafrica area revenue decreased 26 mainly due to the 

 

weakness in the russian ruble exploration activities in the uk and norway fell as customer spending decelerated in subsaharan africa offshore rigs demobilized as explora tion decreased in north africa work progressed slowly while libya activity remained muted as onshore operations were limited due to security concerns revenue in the latin america area declined 22  due to significantly lower activity levels in mexico brazil and colombia because of sustained budget cuts that led to rig count reductions the impact of the devaluation of the venezuela bolivar also affected the revenue decline in the venezuela trinidad and tobago geomarket middle east  asia area rev enue decreased 17  due to a doubledigit drop in revenue in the asiapacific region particularly in australia this decrease arose from reduced activity and pricing concessions but was partially offset by robust activity in the gulf cooperation council countries in the middle east particularly in saudi arabia kuwait and oman activity in iraq continued to decline 

north america fullyear 2015 revenue decreased 39 yearonyear mainly from land which was down 45 while offshore decreased 17 compared to the same period of 2014 the decrease in land was driven by severe activity and pricing declines as customer spending was cut with the yearend us land rig count 68 lower than the 2014 peak the massive overcapacity in the land services market offers no signs of pricing recovery in the short to mediumterm offshore activity in the us gulf of mexico remained resilient although revenue did decline as work shifted from exploration to development activities driven by customer budget cuts

reservoir characterization group 

fullyear 2015 revenue of 95 billion was 26 lower than the same period last year primarily due to sustained customer cuts in exploration and discretionary spending that impacted wireline and testing technologies and software sales revenue also decreased due to lower westerngeco marine vessel utilization and reduced multiclient sales

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 294 bps to 258 as a result of an unfavorable overall revenue mix reflecting the decline in highmargin exploration activity as well as lower highmargin multiclient and software sales

drilling group 

fullyear 2015 revenue of 136 billion was 25 lower than the previous year primarily due to the severe drop in rig count in north america reduced activity levels and service pricing concessions internationally that mainly affected drilling  measurements and mi swaco technologies unfavorable currency effects in russia and venezuela also contributed to the decline 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 228 bps to 187 primarily due to a decrease in highermargin activities of drilling  measurements as well as pricing concessions despite the revenue decline prompt action on cost management and the benefit of a local cost structure that minimized the impact of unfavorable currency effects on pretax operating income helped limit the operating margin decline

internationally higher activities in a number of geomarkets both offshore and in key land markets contributed to the increase the increase was led by the middle east  asia which increased 10 mainly from robust drilling and exploration results in saudi arabia australia the united arab emirates and oman europecisafrica increased 1 led by the subsaharan africa region on strong 

 

dev elopment and exploration activities  particularly in central west africa angola and continental europe geomarkets norway also experienced strong growth driven by market share gains and higher rig  related services for a number of customers latin americ a however decreased 1  primarily because of lower activity and pricing in brazil and mexico which was partially offset by strong activit y in argentina and ecuador 

north america revenue increased 16 mainly due to land which was up 22 while offshore was down 3 the increase in land was driven by market share gains in pressure pumping artificial lift and drilling services the pressure pumping growth was augmented by improvements in operational efficiency and the introduction of new technologies the decrease in offshore revenue was attributable to lower drilling and exploration activities and due to a series of operational delays that impacted several product lines earlier in the year combined with lower multiclient sales

reservoir characterization group 

fullyear 2014 revenue of 129 billion was down 1 compared to 2013 revenue increased in testing services from higher offshore exploration and software integrated solutions driven by software sales across all international areas however these increases were offset by lower westerngeco marine vessel utilization and reduced multiclient seismic sales

yearonyear pretax operating margin increased 30 bps to 287 largely due to the highermargin exploration activities that benefited wireline technologies and testing services higher margin software sales also contributed to the improvement these increases were partially offset by lower profitability in westerngeco due to lower vessel utilization and multiclient seismic sales

drilling group 

fullyear 2014 revenue of 181 billion was 8 higher than 2013 primarily due to the robust demand for drilling  measurements services and mi swaco technologies as activity strengthened in the north america and middle east  asia areas land rig revenue from the may 2014 acquisition of saxon also contributed to the growth

yearonyear pretax operating margin increased 171 bps to 210 primarily due to the increase in highermargin exploration activities of drilling  measurements in north america offshore and in the international markets improved profitability on integrated drilling services activities also contributed to the margin increase

production group 

fullyear 2014 revenue of 178 billion increased 14 compared to 2013 primarily from well services pressure pumping technologies driven by market share gains improvements in operational efficiency and the introduction of new technologies schlumberger production management spm revenue grew as projects in latin america continued to progress ahead of work plans revenue from the expanding artificial lift business also contributed to the yearonyear growth 

yearonyear pretax operating margin increased 121 bps to 180 mainly on improved profitability for well services and well intervention particularly internationally spm activities also contributed to the margin expansion however these improvements were partially offset by the decrease in margins in north america due to pressure pumping commodity cost inflation

 

interest and other income 

interest and other income consisted of the following 

 



 

the decrease in earnings of equity method investments in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily reflects the effects of the downturn in the oil and gas industry which has negatively impacted the majority of schlumberger’s investments in affiliates particularly those in north america

the increase in earnings of equity method investments in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily reflects the strong performance of a drilling service company in which schlumberger has an investment as well as the impact of the first full year of results from the onesubsea joint venture

interest expense 

interest expense of 346 million in 2015 decreased by 23 million compared to 2014 primarily as the effect of an increase in the weighted average debt balance of approximately 05 billion was more than offset by a 30 bps decrease in the weighted average borrowing rates from 28 in 2014 to 25 in 2015 

interest expense of 369 million in 2014 decreased by 22 million compared to 2013 primarily as the effect of an increase in the weighted average debt balance of approximately 11 billion was more than offset by a 40 bps decrease in the weighted average borrowing rates from 32 in 2013 to 28 in 2014 

other 

research  engineering and general  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  were as follows 

 



 

income taxes 

the schlumberger effective tax rate was 259 in 2015 252 in 2014 and 213 in 2013 

the schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease conversely when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase 

the effective tax rate for each of 2015 2014 and 2013 was significantly impacted by the charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements because they were only partially tax effective excluding the impact of these charges and credits the effective tax rate was 202 in 2015 219 in 2014 and 229 in 2013 the decrease in the effective tax rate excluding the impact of charges and credits was primarily attributable to the change in the geographic mix of earnings and the favorable resolution of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions

schlumberger’s international defined benefit pension plans were a combined 93 funded at december 31 2015 based on the projected benefit obligation this compares to 94 funded at december 31 2014 

schlumberger currently anticipates contributing approximately 350 million to its postretirement benefit plans in 2016 subject to market and business conditions 

schlumberger maintains a €50 billion guaranteed euro medium term note program this program provides for the issuance of various types of debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in euro us dollar or other currencies schlumberger has issued €05 billion 150 guaranteed notes due 2019 under this program

the total outstanding commercial paper borrowings were 2383 billion as of december 31 2015 and 1538 billion as of december 31 2014 

summary of contractual obligations 









refer to note 18 pension and other benefit plans of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

as discussed in note 14 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2015 is approximately 13 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 

schlumberger has outstanding letters of creditguarantees that relate to business performance bonds customexcise tax commitments facility leaserental obligations etc these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain 

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

multiclient seismic data 

schlumberger capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december 31 2015 and 2014 was 103 billion and 793 million respectively such costs are charged to cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value 

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library larger surveys which are typically prefunded by customers are analyzed for impairment on a surveybysurvey basis and smaller surveys are analyzed based on two pools of surveys united states and nonunited states the united states and nonunited states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments adjustments to the allowance may be required 

schlumberger operates in more than 85 countries at december 31 2015 only four of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5 of schlumberger’s accounts receivable balance of which only two venezuela and mexico accounted for greater than 10 schlumberger has experienced delays in payment from its national oil company customer in venezuela during the fourth quarter of 2015 schlumberger entered into an agreement with its national oil company customer in venezuela to receive certain fixed assets in lieu of payment of approximately 200 million of accounts receivable

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill the goodwill relating to each of schlumberger’s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred 

under generally accepted accounting principles schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount there is no need to perform any further testing however if schlumberger concludes otherwise then it is required to perform the first step of a twostep impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test 

 

for purposes of performing the i mpairment test for goodwill schlumberger’s reporting units are its three groups reservoir characterization drilling and production schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test in 2015  based on this assessment schlumberger concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying amount accordingly no further testing was required 

longlived assets including fixed assets intangible assets and investments in spm projects are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value as was the case for certain assets in 2015 and 2014 the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 

income taxes 

schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts schlumberger recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities that could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

pension and postretirement benefits 

schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements  the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate that schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans 









the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expected rates of return for the investment portfolio with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans was 725 in both 2015 and 2014 the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international pension plans was 750 in both 2015 and 2014 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine the 2015 postretirement medical expense was 70 graded to 50 over the next ten years the overall medical trend rate assumption utilized to determine the postretirement medical liability at december 31 2015 was 70 graded to 50 over the next ten years 

 

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for the united states and international pension plans 

 



 

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for schlumberger’s united states postretirement medical plans 

 



 

investments in affiliated companies 

investments in affiliated companies on the consolidated balance sheet primarily reflects schlumberger’s investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages and are often still defining their strategic direction such investments are inherently risky and their success is dependent on factors such as technology development market acceptance and their ability to raise additional funds the technology being developed by these companies may never materialize and they could fail schlumberger monitors its portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired if an investment is considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired it is written down to its fair value as was the case for certain investments in 2015 and 2013 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger conducts business in approximately 85 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar which is consistent with the oil and gas industry approximately 83 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2015 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will increase 

a 5 increase or decrease in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in 2015 would have changed revenue by approximately 1 if the 2015 average exchange rates of the us dollar against all foreign currencies had strengthened by 5 schlumberger’s pretax operating income would have increased by approximately 3 conversely a 5 weakening of the us dollar average exchange rates would have decreased pretax operating income by approximately 3 

please refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of exchange rates as it relates to schlumberger’s operations in venezuela

 

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on monetary assetsliabilities denom inated in other than a functional currency or on expenses 

at december 31 2015 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 38 billion in various foreign currencies of which 12 billion relate to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and occasionally interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2015 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 143 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately 47 billion before considering the effects of cross currency swaps 

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio both shortterm investments and fixed income investments  held to maturity  which totaled approximately 107 billion at december 31 2015 are comprised primarily of money market funds time deposits certificates of deposit commercial paper bonds and notes substantially all of which are denominated in us dollars the average return on investments was 10 in 2015 

the following table represents the carrying amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 2015 by year of maturity 

 



 

the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 143 billion as of december 31 2015 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2015 was 10 

schlumberger does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes

schlumberger operates in each of the major oilfield service markets managing its business through three groups reservoir characterization drilling and production each group consists of a number of technologybased service and product lines or technologies these technologies cover the entire life cycle of the reservoir and correspond to a number of markets in which schlumberger holds leading positions the business is also reported through four geographic areas north america latin america europecisafrica and middle east  asia within these areas a network of geomarket regions provides logistical technical and commercial coordination 

 

the role of the groups and technologies is to ensure that schlumberger provides the best possible service to customers and that it remains at the forefront of technology development the groups and technologies are collectively responsible for driving excellence in execution throughout their businesses overseeing operational processes resource allocation personnel and delivering superior financial results the geomarket structure offers customers a single point of contact at the local level for field operations and brings together geographically focused teams to meet local needs and deliver customized solutions the areas and geomarkets are responsible for providing the most efficient and cost effective support possible to the operations

 

the groups are as follows

 

reservoir characterization group – consists of the principal technologies involved in finding and defining hydrocarbon resources these include westerngeco wireline testing services schlumberger information solutions sis and petrotechnical services westerngeco seismic acquisition services and petrotechnical services interpretation solutions combine to provide the industry’s most extensive multiclient library 

 











 

drilling group – consists of the principal technologies involved in the drilling and positioning of oil and gas wells and comprises bits  advanced technologies mi swaco geoservices drilling  measurements drilling tools  remedial saxon rig services and integrated project management well construction projects 

 



 











 

 

production group – consists of the principal technologies involved in the lifetime production of oil and gas reservoirs and includes well services completions artificial lift well intervention water services and schlumberger production management field production projects 

 











 

schlumberger has a 40 equity ownership interest in onesubsea tm  a joint venture with cameron international corporation “cameron” the joint venture manufactures and develops products systems and services for the subsea oil and gas market schlumberger’s 40 share of the net income of the joint venture is reflected in the results of the production group

schlumberger also offers customers its services through business models known as integrated project management ipm for well construction projects and schlumberger production management spm for field production projects these models combine the required services and products of the technologies with drilling rig management specialized engineering and project management expertise to provide a complete solution to well construction and production improvement 

 

ipm projects are typically of multiyear duration and include startup costs and significant thirdparty components that cover services schlumberger does not provide directly projects may be fixed price in nature and may contain penalties for nonperformance 

 

spm commercial arrangements create alignment between schlumberger and the asset holder andor the operator whereby schlumberger receives remuneration in line with its value creation these projects are generally focused on developing and comanaging production of schlumberger’s customers’ assets under longterm agreements schlumberger will invest its own services and products and in some cases cash into the field development activities and operations although in certain arrangements schlumberger is paid for a portion of the services or products it provides generally schlumberger will not be paid at the time of providing its services or upon delivery of its products instead schlumberger is generally compensated based upon cash flow generated or on a feeperbarrel basis for any incremental production schlumberger helps deliver above a mutually agreed baseline

 

supporting the technologies is a global network of research and engineering centers through this organization schlumberger is committed to advanced technology programs that enhance oilfield efficiency lower finding and producing costs improve productivity maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value while accomplishing these goals in a safe and environmentally sound manner

 

managed outside the group structure is schlumberger business consulting which helps oil and gas companies achieve fast and sustainable performance improvements 

 

schlumberger primarily uses its own personnel to market its offerings the customer base business risks and opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all services there is a sharing of manufacturing and engineering facilities as well as research centers and the labor force is interchangeable technological innovation quality of service and price differentiation are the principal methods of competition which varies geographically with respect to the different services offered while there are numerous competitors both large and small schlumberger believes that it is an industry leader in providing geophysical services wireline logging well testing 

 

drilling and completion fluids solids and waste management coiledtubing drill bits measurementwhiledrilling loggingwhiledrilling directional drilling services and mud logging a large proportion of schlumberger offerings is nonrig related consequently revenue does not necessarily correlate to the rig count

seasonality 

seasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of oilfield services for example the spring thaw in canada and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels while the winter months in the north sea russia and china can produce severe weather conditions which typically result in temporarily reduced levels of activity in addition hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations furthermore customer spending patterns for multiclient data software and other oilfield services and products generally result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of each year as clients seek to utilize their annual budgets 

customers and backlog of orders 

for the year ended december 31 2014 no single customer exceeded 10 of consolidated revenue other than westerngeco schlumberger has no significant backlog due to the nature of its businesses the westerngeco backlog which is based on signed contracts with customers was 07 billion at december 31 2014 09 billion at december 31 2013

demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration development and production of oil and natural gas reserves these expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas declines as well as anticipated declines in oil and gas prices could also result in project modifications delays or cancellations general business disruptions and delays in payment of or nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us these effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors including 























the oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonunited states operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 85 countries in which we operate 

our nonunited states operations accounted for approximately 71 of our consolidated revenue in 2014 73 in 2013 and 72 in 2012 operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 













 











 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 schlumberger completed the wind down of its operations in the republic of sudan

as previously disclosed during the second quarter of 2013 schlumberger completed the wind down of its service operations in iran prior to this certain nonus subsidiaries of schlumberger provided oilfield services to the national iranian oil company and certain of its affiliates “nioc” schlumberger has reclassified the results of this business as a discontinued operation all prior periods have been restated accordingly 

schlumberger’s residual transactions or dealings with the government of iran during 2014 consisted of payments of taxes and other typical governmental charges two nonus subsidiaries of schlumberger maintained depository accounts at the dubai branch of bank saderat iran “saderat” and at bank tejarat “tejarat” in tehran for the deposit by nioc of amounts owed to nonus subsidiaries of schlumberger for prior services rendered in iran one nonus subsidiary also maintains an account at tejarat for payment of local expenses such as taxes and utilities schlumberger anticipates that it will discontinue its dealings with saderat and tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to schlumberger for prior services rendered in iran 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 

we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials chemicals and explosives and to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions hydraulic fracturing water discharges and waste management we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex stringent and expensive to implement these laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

we could be subject to substantial liability claims which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health safety and environmental risks our offerings involve productionrelated activities radioactive materials chemicals explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration development and production environments an accident involving these services or equipment or a failure of a product could cause personal injury loss of life damage to or destruction of property equipment or the environment or suspension of operations our insurance may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events including events involving pollution or against losses resulting from business interruption moreover we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for our products and services could be reduced by changes in governmental regulations or in the law 

 

existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services this may in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

some international national state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in lowpermeability reservoirs specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated causing cracks in the target formation proppant such as sand of a particular size is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete future hydraulic fracturingrelated legislation or regulations could limit or ban hydraulic fracturing or lead to operational delays and increased costs and therefore reduce demand for our pressure pumping services if such additional international national state or local legislation or regulations are enacted it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain technology leadership this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold 

if we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in the various markets we serve it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights including our trade secrets could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold 

some of our products or services and the processes we use to produce or provide them have been granted patent protection have patent applications pending or are trade secrets our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business royalty payments under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs additionally developing noninfringing technologies would increase our costs if a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations 

we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases in periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals this could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations 

severe weather conditions may affect our operations 

our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate this may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services in addition if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures this may result in a suspension of activities any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cyber attacks could affect our business

if our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks are circumvented or breached this could result in the loss of our intellectual property or other proprietary information including customer data and disruption of our business operations

the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements including without limitation statements relating to our plans strategies objectives expectations intentions and resources such forwardlooking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under “item 1a risk factors” of this form 10k 

executive overview 

revenue for 2014 reached a record 486 billion up 7 and growing for the fifth consecutive year in north america revenue surged by 23 billion or 16 driven by strong activity both on land and offshore as well as by the penetration of innovative hydraulic stimulation technologies international revenue increased by 12 billion or 4 on significant strength in the middle east  asia despite considerable headwinds in the face of activity challenges geopolitical unrest falling oil prices and international sanctions elsewhere

oil markets remained relatively wellbalanced during 2014 as increasing global production capacity almost matched increasing demand yet after more than three years of remarkable stability oil prices declined dramatically by more than 40 late in the year to end at their lowest levels since 2009 however unlike the 2009 decline which was triggered by a global economic recession the 2014 decline resulted from a higher market supply of oil that became increasingly evident as north american tight oil production continued to grow and opec shifted focus from protecting oil prices to protecting market share at the same time production recovered in countries that had suffered degrees of geopolitical disturbance and the us dollar strengthened to further weaken overall commodity prices

in natural gas markets us prices reached multiyear highs in february 2014 on exceptionally cold weather and risks of local supply shortages storage however returned to historical average levels at the end of 2014 as sustained production growth in the marcellus play and increasing associated gas production in us tight oil plays more than offset the impact of low activity levels in other unconventional plays overall these increasing supplies more than met growing demand internationally natural gas prices eased broadly in 2014 on mild temperatures in europe lng capacity additions in the pacific region and the impact of weaker oil prices on oilindexed natural gas pricing formulas  

against this background schlumberger’s performance in 2014 was led by north america where revenue grew by 16 on robust land activity increased service intensity market share gains and new technology penetration offshore operations however suffered from a number of operational delays that particularly affected drilling and exploration activity the 4 growth in international revenue was led by activity in a number of key markets both on land and offshore middle east  asia revenue grew by 10 driven by saudi arabia australia the united arab emirates and oman revenue in europecisafrica improved by 1 led by the subsaharan region on strong exploration and development activities in the central west africa angola and continental europe geomarkets norway also showed strong growth through market share gains and higher rigrelated services for a number of customers in latin america however revenue slipped by 1 as strong activity in venezuela and ecuador was unable to compensate for lower activity and pricing in both brazil and mexico

from a group perspective performance was led by the drilling group mainly as result of robust demand for drilling  measurements services and mi swaco technologies as activity strengthened in north america and middle east  asia rig revenue from the may 2014 acquisition of saxon also contributed to drilling group growth the production group benefitted from strong results in well services where pressure pumping activity increased through market share gains operational efficiency improvements and the introduction of new technology schlumberger production management grew as projects in latin america particularly in ecuador continued to progress ahead of plan production group activity was also boosted by expansion in the artificial lift business as a number of regional acquisitions were added to the portfolio both in operations and in equipment design and production however strength in the drilling and production groups was offset by a slight fall in reservoir characterization group revenue while testing activity expanded on higher exploration work and software sales increased in all areas weakness in the seismic market lowered marine vessel utilization and reduced multiclient seismic data license sales

as schlumberger enters a challenging 2015 the reduction in commodity prices which have resulted from the higher marketed supply of oil raises shortterm uncertainty as it relates to the spending and activity levels of our customers however schlumberger believes that the oil markets are in fact relatively wellbalanced and that increasing global production capacity is in line with the overall growth in demand resulting from the continuing global economic recovery in the longer term decline rates will impact production capacity and weaker exploration will delay supply additions the combination of which ultimately will lead to tighter market conditions and consequently drive increasing investment 

in this uncertain environment schlumberger continues to focus on the things it can control and has already restructured and resized the business to match the reduced activity levels it expects as 2015 develops these actions resulted in certain charges which are described in detail in note 3 to the reduced consolidated financial statements  being recorded during the fourth quarter of 2014

reservoir characterization group 

fourthquarter revenue of 31 billion declined 3 sequentially pretax operating income of 956 million was flat sequentially the decrease in revenue was primarily driven by the seasonal drop in marine seismic activity in the north sea and eastern canada wireline revenue also decreased on lower exploration activity in angola and seasonal activity and currency declines in russia these sequential decreases were partially offset by yearend multiclient license and software sales

 

sequentially pretax operating margin of 309 increased 95 bps this increase reflected a favorable revenue mix from highmargin multiclient license and software sales

drilling group 

fourthquarter revenue of 47 billion declined 3 sequentially pretax operating income of 966 million was 8 lower sequentially

these decreases were primarily due to the unfavorable currency effects and activity declines in russia for drilling  measurements and mi swaco technologies in mexico lower ipm activity due to budgetary constraints also contributed to the decrease

internationally higher activities in a number of geomarkets both offshore and in key land markets contributed to the increase the increase was led by the middle east  asia which increased 10 mainly from robust drilling and exploration results in saudi arabia australia the united arab emirates and oman europecisafrica increased 1 led by the subsaharan africa region on strong development and exploration activities particularly in central west africa angola and continental europe geomarkets norway also experienced strong growth driven by market share gains and higher rigrelated services for a number of customers latin 

 

america however decreased 1 primarily as a result of lower activity and pricing in brazil and mexico which was partially offset by strong activity in argentina and ecuador 

 

north america revenue increased 16 mainly due to land which was up 22 while offshore was down 3 the increase in land was driven by market share gains in pressure pumping artificial lift and drilling services the pressure pumping growth was augmented by improvements in operational efficiency and the introduction of new technologies the decrease in offshore revenue was attributable to lower drilling and exploration activities and due to a series of operational delays that impacted several product lines earlier in the year combined with lower multiclient sales 

 

fullyear 2014 pretax operating income of 106 billion grew 12 billion or 13 versus the same period last year with international pretax operating income of 77 billion increasing 12 and north america pretax operating income of 31 billion increasing 12

 

fullyear 2014 pretax operating margin of 218 increased 113 bps compared to 2013 as international area pretax operating margin was up 168 bps to 239 while north america pretax operating margin was down 75 bps to 189 the increase in international area margins reflected increased highmargin exploration activities market share gains growth in accretive integrationrelated activities and premium pricing on new technology introductions the north america margin contraction reflected pressure pumping commodity inflation

reservoir characterization group 

fullyear 2014 revenue of 122 billion was down 2 compared to 2013 revenue increased in testing services from higher offshore exploration and schlumberger information solutions driven by software sales across all international areas however these increases were offset by lower westerngeco marine vessel utilization and reduced multiclient seismic sales

 

yearonyear pretax operating margin increased 14 bps to 295 largely due to the highermargin exploration activities that benefited wireline technologies and testing services higher margin software sales also contributed to the improvement these increases were partially offset by lower profitability in westerngeco due to lower vessel utilization and lower petrotechnical services multiclient seismic sales

drilling group 

fullyear 2014 revenue of 185 billion was 8 higher than the 2013 primarily due to the robust demand for drilling  measurements services and mi swaco technologies as activity strengthened in the north america and middle east  asia areas rig revenue from the may 2014 acquisition of saxon also contributed to the growth

 

yearonyear pretax operating margin increased 171 bps to 210 primarily due to the increase in highermargin exploration activities of drilling  measurements in north america offshore and in the international markets improved profitability on integrated project management activities also contributed to the margin increase

production group

fullyear 2013 revenue of 453 billion increased 8 versus the same period last year with international revenue 11 higher and north america revenue increasing 3

 

internationally higher exploration and development activities in a number of geomarkets both offshore and in key land markets contributed to the increase the increase was led by the middle east  asia which increased 24 mainly from robust results across a diversified portfolio of projects and activities in saudi arabia iraq and united arab emirates increased seismic surveys across asia and sustained land and offshore drilling activity in the australasia and china geomarkets europecisafrica increased 8 led by the russia and central asia region on strong land activity in west siberia and robust offshore projects in sakhalin the sub 

 

saharan africa region increased on strong development exploration and seismic activities as well latin america was 3 higher mainly due to solid progress on an spm project in ecuador and strong ipm results in argentina 

 

north america growth was driven by increased offshore revenue as a result of higher drilling and exploration activities this increase was largely offset by a decline in land as a result of a reduction in rig count and pricing weakness in the areas of drilling stimulation and wireline although the downward pricing trend slowed during the second and third quarters 

 

fullyear 2013 pretax operating income of 93 billion increased 15 versus the same period last year as international pretax operating income of 688 billion increased 24 while north america pretax operating income of 27 billion was flat

 

pretax operating margin of 206 increased 119 bps as international pretax operating margin expanded 225 bps to 222 while north america pretax operating margin declined 55 bps to 197 the expansion in international margins was due to increased highmargin exploration seismic and deepwater activities while the north american margin contraction was due to continued pricing pressure

reservoir characterization group 

fullyear revenue of 125 billion was 10 higher than the same period last year led by testing services westerngeco wireline and sis technologies primarily due to market share gains and higher exploration activity in both offshore and key international land markets 

 

pretax operating margin increased 226 bps to 294 largely due to the highermargin exploration activities that benefited testing services and wireline technologies

drilling group 

fullyear revenue of 171 billion was 9 higher than the previous year primarily due to the robust demand for drilling  measurements services as offshore drilling activity strengthened in the us gulf of mexico subsahara africa russia and the middle east  asia area and rig count increases in key international land markets namely in saudi arabia china and australia drilling tools  remedial and mi swaco technologies expanded across all areas and ipm increased on projects in iraq australia and argentina

 

pretax operating margin increased 156 bps to 193 primarily due to drilling  measurements which benefited from highermargin exploration activities both in north america offshore and in the international markets

production group 

fullyear revenue of 159 billion increased 8 yearonyear on increased well intervention activity and strong international sales of completion and artificial lift products and well services technologies spm also posted strong growth while north america land rig count declined well and stage counts increased through drilling efficiency despite the efficiencydriven activity increase well services revenue in north america declined due to pricing weakness

 

pretax operating margin increased slightly by 72 bps to 164 margin expanded as a result of improved profitability in spm completions and artificial lift partially offset by a margin decline in well services technologies primarily in north america as a result of pricing pressure and cost inflation

interest and other income 

interest and other income consisted of the following 



 

the increase in earnings of equity method investments in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily reflects the strong performance of a drilling service company in which schlumberger has an investment as well as the impact of the first full year of results from the onesubsea joint venture

interest expense 

interest expense of 369 million in 2014 decreased by 22 million compared to 2013 primarily as the effect of an increase in the weighted average debt balance of approximately 11 billion was more than offset by a 04 decrease in the weighted average borrowing rates from 32 in 2013 to 28 in 2014 

interest expense of 391 million in 2013 increased by 51 million compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in the weighted average debt balance of approximately 12 billion combined with a 01 increase in the weighted average borrowing rates from 31 in 2012 to 32 in 2013 

other 

research  engineering and general  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  were as follows 

 



income taxes 

the schlumberger effective tax rate was 252 in 2014 213 in 2013 and 244 in 2012 

the schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease conversely when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase 

the effective tax rate for both 2014 and 2013 was significantly impacted by the charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  excluding the impact of these charges and credits the effective tax rate in 2014 was 219 compared to 229 in 2013 the decrease in the effective tax rate excluding the impact of charges and credits was primarily attributable to the change in the geographic mix of earnings and the favorable resolution of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions 

the charges and credits recorded in both 2014 and 2013 had a significant impact on the effective tax rate because for the most part they were not tax effective however the charges and credits in 2012 did not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2013 as compared to 2012 excluding the impact of charges and credits was primarily attributable to the fact that schlumberger generated a smaller proportion of its pretax earnings in north america in 2013 as compared to 2012

charges and credits 

schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in continuing operations during 2014 2013 and 2012 these charges and credits which are summarized below are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements

summary of contractual obligations 







 



refer to note 18 pension and other benefit plans of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

as discussed in note 14 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2014 is approximately 14 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 

schlumberger has outstanding letters of creditguarantees which relate to business performance bonds customexcise tax commitments facility leaserental obligations etc these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain a discussion of all of schlumberger’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

multiclient seismic data 

the westerngeco business capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december 31 2014 and 2013 was 793 million and 667 million respectively such costs are charged to cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value 

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library larger surveys which are typically prefunded by customers are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis and other smaller surveys are analyzed based on two pools of surveys united states and nonunited states the united states and nonunited states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments adjustments to the allowance may be required 

 

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill the goodwill relating to each of schlumberger’s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred 

under generally accepted accounting principles schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount then there is no need to perform any further testing however if schlumberger concludes otherwise then it is required to perform the first step of a twostep impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test 

for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill schlumberger’s reporting units are its three groups reservoir characterization drilling and production schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test in 2014 based on this assessment schlumberger concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying amount accordingly no further testing was required 

longlived assets including fixed assets intangible assets and investments in spm projects are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 

income taxes 

schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

pension and postretirement benefits 

schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements  the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans 







 



the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expected rates of return for the investment portfolio with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans decreased from 750 in 2013 to 725 in 2014 the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international pension plans was 750 in both 2014 and 2013 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine the 2014 postretirement medical expense was 725 graded to 5 over the next ten years the overall medical trend rate assumption utilized to determine the postretirement medical liability at december 31 2014 was 700 graded to 5 over the next ten years 

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for the united states and international pension plans 

 



the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for schlumberger’s united states postretirement medical plans 

 



investments in affiliated companies 

investments in affiliated companies on the consolidated balance sheet primarily reflects schlumberger’s investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages and are often still defining their strategic direction such investments are inherently risky and their success is dependent on factors such as technology development market acceptance and their ability to raise additional funds the technology being developed by these companies may never materialize and they could fail schlumberger monitors its portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired if an investment is considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired it is written down to its fair value 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger conducts business in approximately 85 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar which is consistent with the oil and gas industry approximately 81 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2014 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will increase 

 

a 5 increase or decrease in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in 2014 would have changed revenue by approximately 1 if the 2014 average exchange rates of the us dollar against all foreign currencies had strengthened by 5 schlumberger’s income from continuing operations would have increased by approximately 3 conversely a 5 weakening of the us dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income from continuing operations by approximately 3 

please refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of exchange rates as it relates to schlumberger’s operations in venezuela

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on monetary assetsliabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses 

at december 31 2014 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 68 billion in various foreign currencies of which 25 billion relate to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and occasionally interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2014 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 96 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately 37 billion before considering the effects of cross currency swaps 

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio both shortterm investments and fixed income investments  held to maturity  which totaled approximately 48 billion at december 31 2014 are comprised primarily of money market funds time deposits certificates of deposit commercial paper bonds and notes substantially all of which are denominated in us dollars the average return on investment was 07 in 2014 

the following table represents carrying amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 2014 by year of maturity 

 



the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 98 billion as of december 31 2014 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2014 was 13 

schlumberger does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes

schlumberger operates in each of the major oilfield service markets managing its business through three groups reservoir characterization drilling and production each group consists of a number of technologybased service and product lines or technologies these technologies cover the entire life cycle of the reservoir and correspond to a number of markets in which schlumberger holds leading positions the business is also reported through four geographic areas north america latin america europecisafrica and middle east  asia within these areas a network of geomarket regions provides logistical technical and commercial coordination 

 

the role of the groups and technologies is to ensure that schlumberger provides the best possible service to customers and that it remains at the forefront of technology development the groups and technologies are collectively responsible for driving excellence in execution throughout their businesses overseeing operational processes resource allocation personnel and delivering superior financial results the geomarket structure offers customers a single point of contact at the local level for field operations and brings together geographically focused teams to meet local needs and deliver customized solutions the areas and geomarkets are responsible for providing the most efficient and cost effective support possible to the operations 

 

the groups are as follows 

 

reservoir characterization group – consists of the principal technologies involved in finding and defining hydrocarbon resources these include westerngeco wireline testing services schlumberger information solutions sis and petrotechnical services westerngeco seismic acquisition services and petrotechnical services interpretation solutions combine to provide the industry’s most extensive multiclient library 

 











 

drilling group – consists of the principal technologies involved in the drilling and positioning of oil and gas wells and comprises bits  advanced technologies mi swaco geoservices drilling  measurements drilling tools  remedial and integrated project management well construction projects 

 













  

 

production group – consists of the principal technologies involved in the lifetime production of oil and gas reservoirs and includes well services completions artificial lift well intervention water services carbon services and schlumberger production management field production projects 

 













 

schlumberger has a 40 equity ownership interest in onesubsea tm  a joint venture with cameron international corporation “cameron” the joint venture manufactures and develops products systems and services for the subsea oil and gas market schlumberger’s 40 share of the net income of the joint venture is reflected in the results of the production group 

schlumberger also offers customers its services through business models known as integrated project management ipm for well construction projects and schlumberger production management spm for field production projects these models combine the required services and products of the technologies with drilling rig management specialized engineering and project management expertise to provide a complete solution to well construction and production improvement 

 

ipm projects are typically of multiyear duration and include startup costs and significant thirdparty components that cover services that schlumberger does not provide directly projects may be fixed price in nature and may contain penalties for nonperformance 

 

spm commercial arrangements create alignment between schlumberger and the asset holder andor the operator whereby schlumberger receives remuneration in line with its value creation these projects are generally focused on developing and comanaging production of schlumberger’s customers’ mature assets under longterm agreements schlumberger will invest its own services and products and in some cases cash into the asset schlumberger is generally not paid for services and products at the time of providing the services or upon delivery of the products instead schlumberger is generally compensated on a feeperbarrel basis for any incremental production schlumberger helps deliver above a mutually agreed baseline 

 

supporting the technologies is a global network of research and engineering centers through this organization schlumberger is committed to advanced technology programs that enhance oilfield efficiency lower finding and producing costs improve productivity maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value while accomplishing these goals in a safe and environmentally sound manner 

 

managed outside the group structure is schlumberger business consulting which helps oil and gas companies achieve fast and sustainable performance improvements 

 

schlumberger primarily uses its own personnel to market its offerings the customer base business risks and opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all services there is a sharing of manufacturing and engineering facilities as well as research centers and the labor force is interchangeable technological innovation quality of service and price differentiation are the principal methods of competition which varies geographically with respect to the different services offered while there are numerous competitors both large and small schlumberger believes that it is an industry leader in providing wireline logging well testing drilling and completion fluids coiledtubing drill bits measurementwhiledrilling loggingwhiledrilling and directional drilling services mud logging as well as fully computerized logging and geoscience software and computing services a large proportion of schlumberger offerings is nonrig related consequently revenue does not necessarily correlate to rig count fluctuations

seasonality 

seasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of oilfield services for example the spring thaw in canada and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels while the winter months in the north sea russia and china can produce severe weather conditions which typically result in reduced levels of activity hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations additionally customer spending patterns for multiclient data software and other oilfield services and products generally result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of each year as clients seek to utilize their annual budgets 

customers and backlog of orders 

for the year ended december 31 2013 no single customer exceeded 10 of consolidated revenue other than westerngeco schlumberger has no significant backlog due to the nature of its businesses the westerngeco backlog which is based on signed contracts with customers was 09 billion at december 31 2013 10 billion at december 31 2012

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains important information for the understanding our “forwardlooking statements” which are discussed immediately following item 7a of this form 10k and elsewhere these risk factors should also be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k 

we urge you to consider carefully the risks described below as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k if any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this form 10k were to materialize our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry a substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration development and production of oil and natural gas reserves these expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas declines as well as anticipated declines in oil and gas prices could also result in project modifications delays or cancellations general business disruptions and delays in payment of or nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us these effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors including 























the oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonunited states operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 85 countries in which we operate 

our nonunited states operations accounted for approximately 73 of our consolidated revenue in 2013 72 in 2012 and 71 in 2011 operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 























in addition we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries including sudan and cuba that are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the united states or other governments or organizations united states law enforcement authorities are currently conducting a grand jury investigation and an associated regulatory inquiry related to our historical operations in countries that are subject to united states trade and economic sanctions if any of the risks described above materialize or if any governmental investigation results in criminal or civil penalties or other remedial measures it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

we are also subject to risks related to investment in our common stock in connection with certain us state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries and similar actions by some private investors which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

during 2013 certain nonus subsidiaries of schlumberger provided oilfield services to the national iranian oil company and certain of its affiliates “nioc” schlumberger’s 2013 revenue attributable to this activity was 102 million which resulted in a net loss of 69 million during the second quarter of 2013 schlumberger completed the wind down of its service operations in iran as a result schlumberger has reclassified the results of this business as a discontinued operation all prior periods have been restated accordingly 

schlumberger’s activity in iran during 2013 included obtaining services from and engaging in other dealings with the government of iran that were incidental to operating in iran and the expenses of which are reflected in the results disclosed above these services and other dealings consisted of paying taxes duties license fees and other typical governmental charges along with payments for utilities transportation hotel accommodations facility rentals telecommunications services newspaper advertisements recreational and fitness memberships and the purchase of routine office and similar supplies from entities associated with the government of iran collections of amounts owed to schlumberger for services rendered in iran were received in part by depository accounts held by two nonus subsidiaries of schlumberger at a branch of bank saderat iran “saderat” and in part by a depositary account held by one of such nonus subsidiaries at bank tejarat “tejarat” in tehran the accounts at tejarat are also used in connection with payment of expenses incidental to collection of amounts owed to schlumberger for prior services the accounts at saderat are maintained solely for the deposit by nioc of amounts owed to nonus subsidiaries of schlumberger for prior services one of the nonus subsidiaries also maintained a depository account at bank sarmayeh “sarmayeh” which together with the account at tejarat was maintained for the payment of expenses such as payroll expenses rental payments and taxes in addition nioc maintained bank accounts at bank melli iran “melli” through which it made payments to a nonus subsidiary of schlumberger for services provided in iran under letters of credit issued by melli schlumberger maintains no bank accounts at melli schlumberger has discontinued dealings with melli and sarmayeh and anticipates that it will discontinue its dealings with saderat and tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to schlumberger for prior services rendered in iran 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 

we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials and explosives and to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions hydraulic fracturing water discharges and waste management we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex stringent and expensive to implement these laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

we could be subject to substantial liability claims which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the technical complexities of our operations are such that we are exposed to a wide range of significant health safety and environmental risks our offerings involve productionrelated activities radioactive materials explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration development and production environments an accident involving these services or equipment or a failure of a product could cause personal injury loss of life damage to or destruction of property equipment or the environment or suspension of operations our insurance may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events including events involving pollution or against losses resulting from business interruption moreover we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for our products and services could be reduced by changes in governmental regulations or in the law 

some international national and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and promulgating climaterelated legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting greenhouse gas emissions such legislation as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or to promote the use of alternative energy sources may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services which may in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

some international national and state governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in lowpermeability reservoirs specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated causing cracks in the target formation proppant such as sand of a particular size is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete future hydraulic fracturingrelated legislation or regulations could lead to operational delays and increased costs and therefore reduce demand for our pressure pumping services if such additional international national or state legislation or regulations are enacted it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain technology leadership this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold 

if we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in the various markets we serve it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights including our trade secrets could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold 

some of our products or services and the processes we use to produce or provide them have been granted patent protection have patent applications pending or are trade secrets our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business royalty payments under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs additionally developing noninfringing technologies would increase our costs if a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations 

we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases in periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals this could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations 

severe weather conditions may affect our operations 

our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate this may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services in addition if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures this may result in a suspension of activities any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

executive overview 

schlumberger revenue in 2013 reached a new high of 453 billion – an increase of 8 over 2012 international revenue grew by 32 billion or 11 on higher exploration and development activity – both offshore and in key land markets in north america we demonstrated continued resilience to the challenging land market by growing the business by close to 400 million or 3 aided by our strong position in the offshore market – particularly in the us gulf of mexico 

yearly growth in global oil demand has been stabilizing at close to 1 million barrels per day for the past three years this has been driven by the emerging economies notably in asia and in the middle east while consumption in the oecd countries has levelled after declining for three consecutive years as a result of energy efficiency gains in terms of supply markets are well balanced with north america benefiting from the activityintensive development of tight oil resources that almost singlehandedly drove the increase in global crude oil production in 2013 output from other areas both opec and nonopec remained stable in terms of price geopolitical and security tensions in the middle east and major outages in libya supported oil prices with spot brent prices averaging 109 per barrel in 2013 only slightly below the 112 per barrel of 2012 

international gas markets remained tight during the year driven by strong demand in japan and in the emerging economies in asia relatively limited additional liquefied natural gas and interregional pipeline capacity contributed to support prices at oilparity in the asian spot markets in north america after having reached a 10year low in 2012 natural gas spot prices rallied by 35 in 2013 from progressive rebalancing of supply and demand as well as from relatively cold temperatures in the final months of the year steady production levels – particularly from the continuing development of the marcellus shale gas play – together with strong competition with coal in the power sector prevented prices from rising further 

against this background schlumberger’s international performance during the year was led by the middle east  asia area which grew by 23 from an expanding portfolio of projects and activities in key land markets in the middle east increased exploration and development work across asia and sustained activity in australasia and china within the europecisafrica area yearonyear revenue grew by 8 led by the russia and central asia region on strong land activity in west siberia and robust offshore projects in sakhalin the latin america area grew by 3 over the year mainly due to good progress on the shushufindi production management project in ecuador and strong integrated project management activity in argentina in north america revenue strengthened by 3 driven by higher offshore drilling and exploration activity 

all three product groups benefited from the growth in activity reservoir characterization revenue grew by 10 over the year from market share gains and higher exploration activity in offshore and key international land markets drilling group revenue up 9 increased on robust demand for services as offshore drilling activity strengthened in the us gulf of mexico subsaharan africa russia and in the middle east  asia area drilling group revenue also increased in key international land markets in saudi arabia china and australia on higher rig count production group revenue grew by 8 mostly from activity in the international geomarkets 

during the first half of the year the onesubsea joint venture with cameron was finalized combining schlumberger’s deep understanding of the reservoir and our industryleading well completions subsea processing and integration capabilities with the design capability manufacturing excellence and installation record of cameron onesubsea was formed to offer bestinclass subsea solutions by optimizing complete subsea production systems that help customers improve subsea development production and recovery 

looking ahead to 2014 economic fundamentals are expected to further improve in the us while europe seems set for stronger growth these positive effects should overcome lower growth in some developing economies and support a continuing rebound in the world economy within this scenario oil demand forecasts in 2014 have now been revised upwards to the highest growth rate in several years oil supply is expected to keep pace with demand – with the market therefore remaining well balanced natural gas prices internationally should be supported by demand in asia and europe while in the us no change in fundamentals is expected with any meaningful recovery in dry gas drilling activity still some way out in the future 

with exploration and production spending expected to grow further in 2014 led by international activity and continuing strength in deepwater us gulf of mexico schlumberger remains positive and optimistic about the year ahead on the back of a wellbalanced business portfolio wide geographical footprint and strengthening operational organizational and executional capability

geographic areas 

  











oilfield services 

fourthquarter revenue of 1191 billion increased 298 million or 3 sequentially approximately 75 of the sequential revenue increase came from the yearend surge in product and software sales and 25 came from higher multiclient seismic sales 

international revenue of 815 billion grew 235 million or 3 sequentially while north america area revenue of 365 billion increased 47 million or 1 sequentially 

sequentially reservoir characterization group revenue grew 1 to 325 billion while drilling group revenue of 450 billion was 2 higher production group revenue increased 5 sequentially to 422 billion the increase in reservoir characterization group revenue resulted mainly from robust international endofyear sis software sales and an increase in westerngeco multiclient sales this increase however was largely offset by a sharp seasonal decline in westerngeco marine revenue on lower vessel utilization following completion of surveys in norway and canada wireline also declined sequentially on the conclusion of exploration projects in eastern canada and east africa together with the seasonal slowdown in russia drilling group revenue increased on international demand for drilling  measurements and mi swaco technologies in mexico and russia  central asia as well as in the middle east  asia area stronger ipm project activity in mexico saudi arabia and iraq also contributed to the increase the increase in production group revenue resulted primarily from stronger completions and artificial lift product yearend sales well intervention services declined mainly in north america land while well services revenue grew primarily from higher activity in international markets well services stage count in north america land also increased but revenue declined from persistent pricing weakness as a result of the continuing hydraulic horsepower oversupply 

sequentially by area middle east  asia led the increase with revenue of 294 billion growing 5 mainly from the continued increase in drilling activity and the start of new ipm projects in saudi arabia strong product sales and increased seismic activity in the united arab emirates strong product and yearend software sales in kuwait strong land and offshore exploration activity in the australasia and thailand  myanmar geomarkets and increased westerngeco marine vessel activity in the brunei malaysia  philippines geomarket the increase however was partially reduced by a decline in revenue in iraq from the temporary shutdown in operations linked to a security incident in latin america revenue of 200 billion increased 3 led by mexico and central america on robust deepwater exploration in addition to stronger landbased project activities strong ipm fracturing and drilling activity in argentina and solid progress on spm projects in ecuador also contributed to the increase europecisafrica revenue of 321 billion increased 1 mainly due to robust product and software sales across the area particularly in continental europe significant testing and seismic activities in angola and increased offshore seismic and drilling in azerbaijan and turkmenistan the increase however was partially reduced by seasonally lower activity in russia and decreased westerngeco vessel utilization following the seasonal transit of vessels out of the north sea north america revenue of 365 billion increased 1 sequentially land continued to experience pricing weakness in drilling stimulation and wireline services although the effect of this was offset by increased service intensity improved efficiency market share gains new technology uptake and business expansion offshore revenue declined following seasonal completion of seismic and exploration campaigns in eastern canada while revenue in the us gulf of mexico grew on higher drilling and testing activities 

fourthquarter pretax operating income of 260 billion was up 4 sequentially international pretax operating income of 192 billion increased 4 sequentially while north america pretax operating income of 716 million declined 2 sequentially 

sequentially pretax operating margin of 219 increased 37 basis points bps as international pretax operating margin expanded 23 bps to 235 middle east  asia and europecisafrica margins were steady at 261 and 226 respectively while latin america expanded 59 bps to reach 212 on highermargin exploration drilling and project activity north america pretax operating margin declined 67 bps to 196 due to a seasonal holiday slowdown in activity and continued pricing weakness on land sequentially by segment reservoir characterization group pretax operating margin expanded 132 bps to 317 due to strong endofyear sales of sis software and westerngeco multiclient licenses while the pretax operating margins of the drilling and production groups were 196 and 173 respectively 

reservoir characterization group 

fourthquarter revenue of 325 billion increased 1 sequentially pretax operating income of 103 billion was 5 higher sequentially 

sequentially the increase in revenue was mainly driven by robust international endofyear sis software sales and an increase in westerngeco multiclient sales these increases however were largely offset by the sharp seasonal decline in westerngeco marine revenue on lower vessel utilization following completion of surveys in norway and canada wireline also declined sequentially on the completion of exploration projects in eastern canada and east africa and the seasonal slowdown of activity in russia 

pretax operating margin of 317 increased 132 bps sequentially the sequential increase from strong endofyear sales of sis software and westerngeco multiclient licenses was partially offset by lower westerngeco marine vessel utilization and decreased wireline hightechnology activity following completion of exploration projects 

drilling group 

fourthquarter revenue of 450 billion was up 2 sequentially pretax operating income of 880 million was 2 lower sequentially 

sequentially revenue increased on international demand for drilling  measurements and mi swaco technologies in mexico and russia  central asia as well as in the middle east  asia area stronger ipm project activity in mexico saudi arabia and iraq also contributed to the increase 

sequentially pretax operating margin declined 69 bps to 196 the sequential decline was due to operational startup delays and the geographical mix of activity 

production group 

fourthquarter revenue of 422 billion increased 5 sequentially pretax operating income of 730 million was 3 higher sequentially 

the increase in revenue resulted primarily from stronger completions and artificial lift product yearend sales coupled with new technology uptake and business expansion well intervention services declined mainly in north america land while well services revenue grew primarily from higher activity in international markets well services stage count in north america land also increased but revenue declined from the persistent pricing weakness resulting from the continued hydraulic horsepower oversupply 

sequentially pretax operating margin of 173 was essentially flat the sequential result was attributable to the favorable impact of yearend completions and artificial lift product sales and improved spm profitability being fully offset by continued well services pricing weakness and decline in well intervention services activity

oilfield services 

fullyear 2013 revenue of 4527 billion increased 8 versus the same period last year with international revenue 11 higher and north america area revenue increasing 3 

 

internationally higher exploration and development activities in a number of geomarkets both offshore and in key land markets contributed to the increase the increase was led by the middle east  asia which increased 23 mainly from robust results across a diversified portfolio of projects and activities in saudi arabia iraq and united arab emirates increased seismic surveys across asia and sustained land and offshore drilling activity in the australasia and china geomarkets europecisafrica increased 8 led by the russia and central asia region on strong land activity in west siberia and robust offshore projects in sakhalin the subsaharan africa region increased on strong development exploration and seismic activities as well latin america was 3 higher mainly due to solid progress on an spm project in ecuador and strong ipm results in argentina 

 

north america growth was driven by increased offshore revenue as a result of higher drilling and exploration activities this increase was largely offset by a decline in land as a result of a reduction in rig count and pricing weakness in the areas of drilling stimulation and wireline although the downward pricing trend slowed during the second and third quarters 

 

fullyear 2013 pretax operating income of 934 billion increased 15 versus the same period last year as international pretax operating income of 688 billion increased 24 while north america pretax operating income of 27 billion was flat 

 

pretax operating margin of 206 increased 119 bps as international pretax operating margin expanded 225 bps to 222 while north america pretax operating margin declined 55 bps to 197 the expansion in international margins was due to increased highmargin exploration seismic and deepwater activities while the north american margin contraction was due to continued pricing pressure 

reservoir characterization group 

fullyear revenue of 1225 billion was 10 higher than the same period last year led by testing services westerngeco wireline and sis technologies primarily due to market share gains and higher exploration activity in both offshore and key international land markets 

 

pretax operating margin increased 228 bps to 298 largely due to the highermargin exploration activities that benefited testing services and wireline technologies 

drilling group 

fullyear revenue of 1732 billion was 9 higher than the previous year primarily due to the robust demand for drilling  measurements services as offshore drilling activity strengthened in the us gulf of mexico subsahara africa russia and the middle east  asia area and rig count increases in key international land markets namely in saudi arabia china and australia drilling tools  remedial and mi swaco technologies expanded across all areas and ipm increased on projects in iraq australia and argentina 

 

pretax operating margin increased 156 bps to 191 primarily due to drilling  measurements which benefited from highermargin exploration activities both in north america offshore and in the international markets 

production group 

fullyear revenue of 1593 billion increased 8 yearonyear on increased well intervention activity and strong international sales of completion and artificial lift products and well services technologies spm also posted strong growth while north america land rig count declined well and stage counts increased through drilling efficiency despite the efficiencydriven activity increase well services revenue in north america declined due to pricing weakness 

 

pretax operating margin increased slightly by 72 bps to 164 margin expanded as a result of improved profitability in spm completions and artificial lift partially offset by a margin decline in well services technologies primarily in north america as a result of pricing pressure and cost inflation

fullyear 2012 revenue of 4173 billion increased 14 versus the same period last year with north america area 9 higher and international activity 16 higher internationally higher exploration and development activities in a number of geomarkets both offshore and in key land markets contributed to the increase the increase was led by the europecisafrica area which increased 18 mainly in russia and in the nigeria  gulf of guinea angola the east africa and north sea geomarkets latin america was higher by 17 mainly in the mexico  central america venezuela trinidad  tobago and ecuador geomarkets driven by strong ipm activity on land and robust offshore activity for wireline and drilling group services and products middle east  asia increased 14 on strong results in the saudi arabia  bahrain australasia brunei malaysia  philippines and china geomarkets the increase in north america was due to strong growth in north america offshore driven by robust deepwater and exploration activity that benefited the reservoir characterization and drilling groups technologies there was also an improvement in activity in north america land for the production group technologies although the increase slowed in the second half of the year due to the weakness in the hydraulic fracturing market 

fullyear 2012 pretax operating income of 81 billion increased 15 yearonyear as international pretax operating income of 56 billion increased 32 while north america pretax operating income of 27 billion declined by 10 yearonyear 

pretax operating margin was essentially flat at 195 as international pretax operating margin expanded 238 bps to 200 while north america pretax operating margin declined 441 bps to 202 europecisafrica posted a 435 bps improvement to reach 196 and latin america increased 175 bps to 184 and middle east  asia reported a 48 bps increase to 219 north america margin decline was due to well services production technologies as a result of pricing pressure and cost inflation 

reservoir characterization group 

fullyear revenue of 1116 billion was 15 higher than the same period last year led by wireline testing services westerngeco and sis technologies driven by improved offshore exploration activities across all areas 

pretax operating margin increased 340 bps to 275 largely due to the highermargin exploration activities that benefited wireline and testing services higher sis software sales higher westerngeco marine vessel utilization and improved uniq land seismic productivity 

drilling group 

fullyear revenue of 1589 billion was 15 higher than the previous year primarily due to the significantly improved exploration and development activities of mi swaco drilling  measurements and the other drilling group technologies in north america offshore and in the international markets 

pretax operating margin increased 145 bps to 176 primarily due to the increase in highermargin activities of drilling  measurements mi swaco and drilling tools  remedial technologies  all of which benefited from exploration activities in north america offshore and in the international markets  mainly in the europecisafrica area 

production group 

fullyear revenue of 1480 billion increased 14 yearonyear both in north america and the international markets well intervention artificial lift and completions technologies posted strong growth across all areas well services grew both in north america and internationally with international growth led by latin america and europecisafrica 

pretax operating margin decreased 388 bps to 157 mainly due to a decline in margins for well services production technologies primarily in north america as a result of pricing pressure and cost inflation this was mitigated by margin expansion for the other production group technologies led by well intervention services and completions 

interest and other income 

interest and other income consisted of the following 

  



interest expense 

interest expense of 391 million in 2013 increased by 51 million compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in the weighted average debt balance of approximately 12 billion combined with a 01 increase in the weighted average borrowing rates from 31 in 2012 to 32 in 2013 

interest expense of 340 million in 2012 increased by 42 million compared to 2011 primarily due to the 1 billion of 125 senior notes due 2017 and 1 billion of 240 senior notes due 2022 that schlumberger issued during 2012 

other 

research  engineering and general  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  were as follows 

  



income taxes 

the schlumberger effective tax rate was 213 in 2013 244 in 2012 and 248 in 2011 

the schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease conversely when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase 

the effective tax rate for 2013 was significantly impacted by the charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  these charges and credits reduced the effective tax rate in 2013 by approximately two percentage points the decrease in the effective tax rate excluding the impact of the charges and credits from 2012 to 2013 was primarily attributable to the fact that schlumberger generated a smaller proportion of its pretax earnings in north america in 2013 as compared to 2012 

charges and credits 

schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in continuing operations during 2013 2012 and 2011 these charges and credits which are summarized below are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  

the following is a summary of the 2013 charges and credits

net debt 

net debt represents gross debt less cash shortterm investments and fixed income investments held to maturity management believes that net debt provides useful information regarding the level of schlumberger’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt 

details of changes in net debt follow 

  





  



 

key liquidity events during 2013 2012 and 2011 included 























on july 18 2013 the board approved a new 10 billion share repurchase program to be completed at the latest by june 30 2018 schlumberger had repurchased 17 billion of shares under this program as of december 31 2013 

the following table summarizes the activity under this share repurchase program during 2013 2012 and 2011 

  



 



from time to time in recent years schlumberger has experienced delays in payment from its national oil company customer in venezuela schlumberger operates in approximately 85 countries at december 31 2013 only five of those countries including venezuela individually accounted for greater than 5 of schlumberger’s accounts receivable balance of which only one the united states represented greater than 10 



on january 16 2014 schlumberger announced that its board had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 28 to 040 

on january 17 2013 schlumberger announced that its board had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 136 to 03125 

on january 19 2012 schlumberger announced that its board had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 10 to 0275 





schlumberger’s international defined benefit pension plans are a combined 104 funded at december 31 2013 based on the projected benefit obligation this compares to 88 funded at december 31 2012 

schlumberger currently anticipates contributing approximately 500 million to its postretirement benefit plans in 2014 subject to market and business conditions 

 

schlumberger maintains a €50 billion guaranteed euro medium term note program this program provides for the issuance of various types of debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in euro us dollar or other currencies schlumberger has issued €05 billion 150 guranteed notes due 2019 €10 billion 275 guaranteed notes due 2015 and €10 billion 450 guaranteed notes due 2014 under this program 

as of december 31 2013 schlumberger had 84 billion of cash and shortterm investments on hand schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating 40 billion with commercial banks of which 37 billion was available and unused as of december 31 2013 this included 35 billion of committed facilities which support commercial paper borrowings in europe schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months 

the total outstanding commercial paper borrowings were 95 million as of december 31 2013 schlumberger did not have any commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2012 

summary of contractual obligations 

  









refer to note 18 pension and other benefit plans of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

as discussed in note 14 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2013 is approximately 145 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 

schlumberger has outstanding letters of creditguarantees which relate to business performance bonds customexcise tax commitments facility leaserental obligations etc these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain a summary of all of schlumberger’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

multiclient seismic data 

the westerngeco business capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december 31 2013 and 2012 was 667 million and 518 million respectively such costs are charged to cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value 

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library larger surveys which are typically prefunded by customers are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis and other smaller surveys are analyzed based on two pools of surveys united states and nonunited states the united states and nonunited states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments adjustments to the allowance may be required 

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill the goodwill relating to each of schlumberger’s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred 

under generally accepted accounting principles schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount then there is no need to perform any further testing however if schlumberger concludes otherwise then it is required to perform the first step of a twostep impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test 

for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill schlumberger’s reporting units are its three groups reservoir characterization drilling and production schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test based on this assessment schlumberger concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying amount accordingly no further testing was required 

longlived assets including fixed assets and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 

income taxes 

schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

pension and postretirement benefits 

schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements  the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans 









the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for each of the united states and international pension plans was 750 in both 2013 and 2012 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine the 2013 postretirement medical expense was 75 graded to 5 over the next ten years the overall medical trend rate assumption utilized to determine the postretirement medical liability at december 31 2013 was 725 graded to 5 over the next ten years 

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for the united states and international pension plans 

  



the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for schlumberger’s united states postretirement medical plans 

  



investments in affiliated companies 

investments in affiliated companies on the consolidated balance sheet primarily reflects schlumberger’s investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages and are often still defining their strategic direction such investments are inherently risky and their success is dependent on factors such as technology development market acceptance and their ability to raise additional funds the technology being developed by these companies may never materialize and they could fail schlumberger monitors its portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired if an investment is considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired it is written down to its fair value 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger conducts business in approximately 85 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar which is consistent with the oil and gas industry approximately 78 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2013 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will increase 

a 5 increase or decrease in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in 2013 would have changed revenue by approximately 1 if the 2013 average exchange rates of the us dollar against all foreign currencies had strengthened by 5 schlumberger’s income from continuing operations would have increased by approximately 2 conversely a 5 weakening of the us dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income from continuing operations by approximately 2 

in late january 2014 venezuela announced the establishment of a dual exchange rate system a rate of 63 venezuelan bolivares fuertes to the us dollar will be applied to priority sectors such as food and medicine while other sectors of the economy will apply an exchange rate determined based on the results of the venezuelan central bank’s system of weekly currency auctions schlumberger is in the process of analyzing the impact if any of this change on its 2014 consolidated financial statements 

although the functional currency of schlumberger’s operations in venezuela is the us dollar a portion of the transactions are denominated in venezuelan bolivares fuertes for financial reporting purposes such local currency transactions are remeasured into us dollars at the official exchange rate which was fixed at 63 venezuelan bolivares fuertes to the us dollar for most of 2013 at december 31 2013 schlumberger had approximately 330 million of net monetary assets denominated in venezuelan bolivares fuertes depending on the exchange rate schlumberger is required to apply it may incur a charge to its income statement in the first 

quarter of 2014 for example if schlumberger was required to apply an exchange rate of 113 venezuelan bolivares fuertes to the us dollar the rate per the auction system at january 24 2014 it would result in a charge of approximately 150 million 

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on monetary assetsliabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses 

at december 31 2013 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 76 billion in various foreign currencies of which 38 billion relate to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and from time to time interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2013 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 112 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately 19 billion before considering the effects of cross currency and interest rate swaps 

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio both shortterm investments and fixed income investments  held to maturity  which totaled approximately 53 billion at december 31 2013 are comprised primarily of money market funds eurodollar time deposits certificates of deposit commercial paper euro notes and eurobonds and are substantially all denominated in us dollars the average return on investment was 05 in 2013 

the following table represents carrying amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 2013 by year of maturity 

  



the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 113 billion as of december 31 2013 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2013 was 28 

schlumberger does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes

schlumberger operates in each of the major oilfield service markets managing its business through three groups reservoir characterization drilling and production each group consists of a number of technologybased service and product lines or technologies these technologies cover the entire life cycle of the reservoir and correspond to a number of markets in which schlumberger holds leading positions the business is also reported through four geographic areas north america latin america europecisafrica and middle east  asia within these areas a network of geomarket regions provides logistical technical and commercial coordination 

the role of the groups and technologies is to ensure that schlumberger provides the best possible service to customers and that it remains at the forefront of technology development the groups and technologies are collectively responsible for driving excellence in execution throughout their businesses overseeing operational processes resource allocation personnel and delivering superior financial results the geomarket structure offers customers a single point of contact at the local level for field operations and brings together geographically focused teams to meet local needs and deliver customized solutions the areas and geomarkets are responsible for providing the most efficient and cost effective support possible to the operations 

the groups are as follows 

reservoir characterization group – consists of the principal technologies involved in finding and defining hydrocarbon resources these include westerngeco wireline testing services schlumberger information solutions and petrotechnical services 

 

  

  

  

  

 drilling group – consists of the principal technologies involved in the drilling and positioning of oil and gas wells and comprises bits  advanced technologies mi swaco geoservices drilling  measurements pathfinder drilling tools  remedial services dynamic pressure management and integrated project management well construction projects 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 production group – consists of the principal technologies involved in the lifetime production of oil and gas reservoirs and includes well services completions artificial lift well intervention subsea water services carbon services and schlumberger production management field production projects 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 schlumberger also offers customers its services through business models known as integrated project management for well construction projects and schlumberger production management for field production projects these models combine the required services and products of the technologies with both drilling rig management expertise and project management skills to provide a complete solution to well construction and production improvement projects are typically of multiyear duration and include startup costs and significant thirdparty components that cover services that schlumberger does not provide directly projects may be fixed price in nature contain penalties for nonperformance and may also offer opportunities for bonus payments where performance exceeds agreed targets integrated project management and schlumberger production management also provide specialized engineering and project management expertise when schlumberger is requested to include these capabilities with services and products across the technologies in a single contract in no circumstances does schlumberger take any stake in the ownership of oil or gas reserves 

  

supporting the technologies is a global network of research and engineering centers through this organization schlumberger is committed to advanced technology programs that enhance oilfield efficiency lower finding and producing costs improve productivity maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value while accomplishing these goals in a safe and environmentally sound manner 

managed outside the group structure is schlumberger business consulting which helps oil and gas companies achieve fast and sustainable performance improvements 

schlumberger primarily uses its own personnel to market its offerings the customer base business risks and opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all services there is a sharing of manufacturing and engineering facilities as well as research centers and the labor force is interchangeable technological innovation quality of service and price differentiation are the principal methods of competition which varies geographically with respect to the different services offered while there are numerous competitors both large and small schlumberger believes that it is an industry leader in providing wireline logging well testing drilling and completion fluids coiledtubing drill bits measurementwhiledrilling loggingwhiledrilling and directionaldrilling services mud logging as well as fully computerized logging and geoscience software and computing services a large proportion of schlumberger offerings is nonrig related consequently revenue does not necessarily correlate to rig count fluctuations

seasonality 

seasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of oilfield services for example the spring thaw in canada and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels while the winter months in the north sea russia and china can produce severe weather conditions which typically result in reduced levels of activity hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations additionally customer spending patterns for multiclient data software and other oilfield services and products generally result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of each year as clients seek to utilize their annual budgets 

customers and backlog of orders 

for the year ended december 31 2012 no single customer exceeded 10 of consolidated revenue other than westerngeco schlumberger has no significant backlog due to the nature of its businesses the westerngeco backlog which is based on signed contracts with customers was 10 billion at december 31 2012 10 billion at december 31 2011

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following discussion of risk factors are important information in understanding our “forwardlooking statements” which are discussed immediately following item 7a of this form 10k and elsewhere these risk factors should also be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k 

we urge you to consider carefully the risks described below as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k if any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this form 10k were to materialize our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry a substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration development and production of oil and natural gas reserves these expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas declines as well as anticipated declines in oil and gas prices could also result in project modifications delays or cancellations general business disruptions and delays in payment of or nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us these effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 the oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonunited states operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 85 countries in which we operate 

our nonunited states operations accounted for approximately 72 of our consolidated revenue in 2012 71 in 2011 and 78 in 2010 operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries including iran syria north sudan and cuba that are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the united states or other governments or organizations united states law enforcement authorities are currently conducting a grand jury investigation and an associated regulatory inquiry related to our operations in certain of these countries additionally in 2009 prior to being acquired by schlumberger smith international inc received an administrative subpoena with respect to its historical business practices in certain countries that are subject to united states trade and economic sanctions if any of the risks described above materialize or if any governmental investigation results in criminal or civil penalties or other remedial measures it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

we are also subject to risks related to investment in our common stock in connection with certain us state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries and similar actions by some private investors which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

during 2012 certain nonus subsidiaries of schlumberger provided oilfield services to the national iranian oil company and certain of its affiliates “nioc” schlumberger has not bid on any new contracts relating to iran’s petroleum production since march 2009 schlumberger’s fullyear 2012 revenue attributable to this activity was 418 million which resulted in net income of 208 million in its consolidated financial statements schlumberger intends to discontinue such activity in iran in 2013 and is currently winding down its operations there in this regard during the fourth quarter of 2012 schlumberger recorded revenue relating to this activity in iran of 92 million and net income of 48 million in its consolidated financial statements this activity included obtaining services from and engaging in other dealings with the government of iran that are incidental to operating in iran and the expenses of which are reflected in the net income disclosed above these services and other dealings consisted of paying taxes duties license fees and other typical governmental charges along with payments for utilities transportation hotel accommodations facility rentals 

  

telecommunications services newspaper advertisements recreational and fitness memberships and the purchase of routine office and similar supplies from entities associated with the government of iran collections of amounts owed to schlumberger were received in part by depository accounts held by two nonus subsidiaries of schlumberger at a branch of bank saderat iran “saderat” and in part by a depositary account held by one of such nonus subsidiaries at bank tejarat “tejarat” in tehran the accounts at saderat are maintained solely for the deposit by nioc of amounts owed to nonus subsidiaries of schlumberger the account at tejarat is maintained also for payment of expenses in connection with operating in iran such as payroll expenses rental payments and taxes in addition nioc maintains bank accounts at bank melli iran “melli” through which it made payments to a nonus subsidiary of schlumberger for services provided in iran under letters of credit issued by melli schlumberger maintains no bank accounts at melli schlumberger will discontinue its dealings with melli saderat and tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to schlumberger for services in iran 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 

we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials and explosives and to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges and waste management we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex stringent and expensive to implement these laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations 

we could be subject to substantial liability claims which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the technical complexities of our operations are such that we are exposed to a wide range of significant health safety and environmental risks our offerings involve productionrelated activities radioactive materials explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration development and production environments an accident involving these services or equipment or a failure of a product could cause personal injury loss of life damage to or destruction of property equipment or the environment or suspension of operations our insurance may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events including events involving pollution or against losses resulting from business interruption moreover we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for our products and services could be reduced by changes in governmental regulations or in the law 

some international national and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and promulgating climaterelated legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting greenhouse gas emissions such legislation as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or to promote the use of alternative energy sources may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services which may in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

some international national and state governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in lowpermeability reservoirs specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated 

  

causing cracks in the target formation proppant such as sand of a particular size is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete future hydraulic fracturingrelated legislation or regulations could lead to operational delays and increased costs and therefore reduce demand for our pressure pumping services if such additional international national or state legislation or regulations are enacted it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain technology leadership this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold 

if we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in the various markets we serve it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights including our trade secrets could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold 

some of our products or services and the processes we use to produce or provide them have been granted patent protection have patent applications pending or are trade secrets our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business royalty payments under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs if a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally developing noninfringing technologies would increase our costs 

failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations

schlumberger operates in each of the major oilfield service markets managing its business through three groups reservoir characterization drilling and production each group consists of a number of technologybased service and product lines or technologies these technologies cover the entire life cycle of the reservoir and correspond to a number of markets in which schlumberger holds leading positions the business is also reported through four geographic areas north america latin america europecisafrica and middle east  asia within these areas a network of geomarket regions provides logistical technical and commercial coordination 

the role of the groups and technologies is to ensure that schlumberger provides the best possible service to customers and that it remains at the forefront of technology development the groups and technologies are collectively responsible for driving excellence in execution throughout their businesses overseeing operational processes resource allocation personnel and delivering superior financial results the geomarket structure offers customers a single point of contact at the local level for field operations and brings together geographically focused teams to meet local needs and deliver customized solutions the areas and geomarkets are responsible for providing the most efficient and cost effective support possible to the operations 

the groups are as follows 

reservoir characterization group – consists of the principal technologies involved in finding and defining hydrocarbon resources these include westerngeco wireline testing services schlumberger information solutions and petrotechnical services 

 

  

  

  

  

 drilling group – consists of the principal technologies involved in the drilling and positioning of oil and gas wells and comprises bits  advanced technologies mi swaco geoservices drilling  measurements pathfinder drilling tools  remedial services dynamic pressure management and integrated project management well construction projects 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 production group – consists of the principal technologies involved in the lifetime production of oil and gas reservoirs and includes well services completions artificial lift well intervention subsea water services carbon services and schlumberger production management field production projects 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 schlumberger also offers customers its services through business models known as integrated project management for well construction projects and schlumberger production management for field production projects these models combine the required services and products of the technologies with both drilling rig management expertise and project management skills to provide a complete solution to well construction and production improvement projects are typically of multiyear duration and include startup costs and significant thirdparty components that cover services that schlumberger does not provide directly projects may be fixed price in nature contain penalties for nonperformance and may also offer opportunities for bonus payments where performance exceeds agreed targets integrated project management and schlumberger production management also provide specialized engineering and project management expertise when schlumberger is requested to include these capabilities with services and products across the technologies in a single contract in no circumstances does schlumberger take any stake in the ownership of oil or gas reserves 

  

supporting the technologies is a global network of research and engineering centers through this organization schlumberger is committed to advanced technology programs that enhance oilfield efficiency lower finding and producing costs improve productivity maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value while accomplishing these goals in a safe and environmentally sound manner 

managed outside the group structure is schlumberger business consulting which helps oil and gas companies achieve fast and sustainable performance improvements 

schlumberger primarily uses its own personnel to market its offerings the customer base business risks and opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all services there is a sharing of manufacturing and engineering facilities as well as research centers and the labor force is interchangeable technological innovation quality of service and price differentiation are the principal methods of competition which varies geographically with respect to the different services offered while there are numerous competitors both large and small schlumberger believes that it is an industry leader in providing wireline logging well testing drilling and completion fluids coiledtubing drill bits measurementwhiledrilling loggingwhiledrilling and directionaldrilling services mud logging as well as fully computerized logging and geoscience software and computing services a large proportion of schlumberger offerings is nonrig related consequently revenue does not necessarily correlate to rig count fluctuations

seasonality 

seasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of oilfield services for example the spring thaw in canada and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels while the winter months in the north sea russia and china can produce severe weather conditions which typically result in reduced levels of activity hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations additionally customer spending patterns for multiclient data software and other oilfield services and products generally result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of each year as clients seek to utilize their annual budgets 

customers and backlog of orders 

for the year ended december 31 2012 no single customer exceeded 10 of consolidated revenue other than westerngeco schlumberger has no significant backlog due to the nature of its businesses the westerngeco backlog which is based on signed contracts with customers was 10 billion at december 31 2012 10 billion at december 31 2011

 the following discussion of risk factors are important information in understanding our “forwardlooking statements” which are discussed immediately following item 7a of this form 10k and elsewhere these risk factors should also be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k 

we urge you to consider carefully the risks described below as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k if any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this form 10k were to materialize our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry a substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration development and production of oil and natural gas reserves these expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas declines as well as anticipated declines in oil and gas prices could also result in project modifications delays or cancellations general business disruptions and delays in payment of or nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us these effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 the oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonunited states operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 85 countries in which we operate 

our nonunited states operations accounted for approximately 72 of our consolidated revenue in 2012 71 in 2011 and 78 in 2010 operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries including iran syria north sudan and cuba that are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the united states or other governments or organizations united states law enforcement authorities are currently conducting a grand jury investigation and an associated regulatory inquiry related to our operations in certain of these countries additionally in 2009 prior to being acquired by schlumberger smith international inc received an administrative subpoena with respect to its historical business practices in certain countries that are subject to united states trade and economic sanctions if any of the risks described above materialize or if any governmental investigation results in criminal or civil penalties or other remedial measures it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

we are also subject to risks related to investment in our common stock in connection with certain us state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries and similar actions by some private investors which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

during 2012 certain nonus subsidiaries of schlumberger provided oilfield services to the national iranian oil company and certain of its affiliates “nioc” schlumberger has not bid on any new contracts relating to iran’s petroleum production since march 2009 schlumberger’s fullyear 2012 revenue attributable to this activity was 418 million which resulted in net income of 208 million in its consolidated financial statements schlumberger intends to discontinue such activity in iran in 2013 and is currently winding down its operations there in this regard during the fourth quarter of 2012 schlumberger recorded revenue relating to this activity in iran of 92 million and net income of 48 million in its consolidated financial statements this activity included obtaining services from and engaging in other dealings with the government of iran that are incidental to operating in iran and the expenses of which are reflected in the net income disclosed above these services and other dealings consisted of paying taxes duties license fees and other typical governmental charges along with payments for utilities transportation hotel accommodations facility rentals 

  

telecommunications services newspaper advertisements recreational and fitness memberships and the purchase of routine office and similar supplies from entities associated with the government of iran collections of amounts owed to schlumberger were received in part by depository accounts held by two nonus subsidiaries of schlumberger at a branch of bank saderat iran “saderat” and in part by a depositary account held by one of such nonus subsidiaries at bank tejarat “tejarat” in tehran the accounts at saderat are maintained solely for the deposit by nioc of amounts owed to nonus subsidiaries of schlumberger the account at tejarat is maintained also for payment of expenses in connection with operating in iran such as payroll expenses rental payments and taxes in addition nioc maintains bank accounts at bank melli iran “melli” through which it made payments to a nonus subsidiary of schlumberger for services provided in iran under letters of credit issued by melli schlumberger maintains no bank accounts at melli schlumberger will discontinue its dealings with melli saderat and tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to schlumberger for services in iran 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 

we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials and explosives and to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges and waste management we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex stringent and expensive to implement these laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations 

we could be subject to substantial liability claims which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the technical complexities of our operations are such that we are exposed to a wide range of significant health safety and environmental risks our offerings involve productionrelated activities radioactive materials explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration development and production environments an accident involving these services or equipment or a failure of a product could cause personal injury loss of life damage to or destruction of property equipment or the environment or suspension of operations our insurance may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events including events involving pollution or against losses resulting from business interruption moreover we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for our products and services could be reduced by changes in governmental regulations or in the law 

some international national and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and promulgating climaterelated legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting greenhouse gas emissions such legislation as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or to promote the use of alternative energy sources may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services which may in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

some international national and state governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in lowpermeability reservoirs specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated 

  

causing cracks in the target formation proppant such as sand of a particular size is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete future hydraulic fracturingrelated legislation or regulations could lead to operational delays and increased costs and therefore reduce demand for our pressure pumping services if such additional international national or state legislation or regulations are enacted it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain technology leadership this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold 

if we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in the various markets we serve it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights including our trade secrets could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold 

some of our products or services and the processes we use to produce or provide them have been granted patent protection have patent applications pending or are trade secrets our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business royalty payments under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs if a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally developing noninfringing technologies would increase our costs 

failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations 

we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases in periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals this could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations 

severe weather conditions may affect our operations 

our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate this may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services in addition if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures this may result in a suspension of activities any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 item 5 market for schlumberger’s common stock related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities tableend as of december 31 2012 there were approximately 22455 stockholders of record the principal united states market for schlumberger’s common stock is the nyse where it is traded under the symbol “slb” although it is traded on other exchanges in and outside the united states including the euronext paris the london stock exchange and the six swiss exchange 

common stock market prices and dividends declared per share 

quarterly high and low prices for schlumberger’s common stock as reported by the nyse composite transactions together with dividends declared per share in each quarter of 2012 and 2011 were 

 

 on january 17 2013 schlumberger announced that its board of directors had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 136 to 03125 

there are no legal restrictions on the payment of dividends or ownership or voting of such shares except as to shares held as treasury stock under current legislation stockholders are not subject to any curaçao withholding or other curaçao taxes attributable to the ownership of such shares 

the following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on schlumberger common stock assuming reinvestment of dividends on the last day of the month of payment into common stock of schlumberger with the cumulative total return on the standard  poor’s 500 index sp 500 index and the cumulative total return on the philadelphia oil service index osx over the fiveyear period ended december 31 2012 the stockholder return set forth below is not necessarily indicative of future performance the following graph and related information shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the sec nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the securities act of 1933 or the securities exchange act of 1934 except to the extent that schlumberger specifically incorporates it by reference into such filing

share repurchases 

on april 17 2008 the schlumberger board of directors approved an 8 billion share repurchase program for schlumberger common stock to be acquired in the open market before december 31 2011 on july 21 2011 the board of directors approved an extension of this repurchase program to december 31 2013 

schlumberger did not repurchase any common stock during the three months ended december 31 2012 the maximum value of shares that may be purchased under this program as of december 31 2012 was 879 million 

in connection with the exercise of stock options under schlumberger’s incentive compensation plans schlumberger routinely receives shares of its common stock from optionholders in consideration of the exercise price of the stock options schlumberger does not view these transactions as requiring disclosure under this item 5 as the number of shares of schlumberger common stock received from optionholders is not material 

unregistered sales of equity securities 

as discussed in note 13 of the consolidated financial statements  schlumberger maintains a discounted stock purchase plan the “dspp” which was established in 1988 the dspp provides for two purchase periods each calendar year january 1 to june 30 and july 1 to december 31 schlumberger filed registration statements with the sec to register the shares initially available for purchase under the dspp as well as to register additional shares that were approved by schlumberger stockholders in 2005 in 2010 schlumberger stockholders approved an amendment to the dspp that among other things increased the number of shares available for purchase under the dspp by 10000000 shares in december 2012 schlumberger discovered that it had inadvertently failed to file a registration statement with the sec to register the additional dspp shares approved in 2010 in december 2012 schlumberger registered the sale of the shares that remain available for purchase under the dspp prior to such registration however some of the shares schlumberger sold under the dspp were unregistered with respect to the sixmonth 

  

purchase period ending june 30 2012 2197151 unregistered shares were sold at a discounted purchase price of 5989 per share resulting in cash proceeds of approximately 132 million the company believes that it has historically provided participants in the dspp with the same information they would have received had the registration statement been filed nonetheless original purchasers of the unregistered shares may have rescission rights with respect to the shares purchased by them with respect to the sixmonth purchase period ended june 30 2012 schlumberger believes that any liability resulting from a potential rescission would be immaterial particularly in light of the fact that the market price of schlumberger’s common stock has exceeded the participants’ discounted purchase price since the date of purchase

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements including without limitation statements relating to our plans strategies objectives expectations intentions and resources such forwardlooking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under “item 1a risk factors” of this form 10k 

executive overview 

schlumberger revenue reached a new high of 4215 billion in 2012 – an increase of 14 over 2011 – driven by robust exploration and development both offshore and in key land markets outside north america revenue grew 16 while north america revenue grew 9 with strong offshore activity in the us gulf of mexico outweighing a challenging land market 

global demand for oil recorded annual growth of some 08 million barrels per day for the second year running following the exceptionally strong recovery of 2010 lower demand in the oecd countries through energy efficiency gains tempered stronger growth in the nonoecd economies and in china in particular oil supply grew by more than one million barrels per day in north america as light tight oil production accelerated although this was partially offset by decline in a number of nonopec countries within opec production in libya continued to recover leading to a slight increase in spare capacity which remained relatively slim this together with ongoing geopolitical tension and the associated risk of supply disruption continued to support oil prices 

for natural gas the three main markets continued to behave independently in north america storage levels remained at record highs throughout the year as a result of growing domestic production and mild weather that pushed spot prices to 10year lows in april toward the end of the year however storage levels returned closer to historical averages in asia natural gas prices remained close to oil parity supported by sustained high demand in japan following the 2011 nuclear incident and by strong demand in china in europe lower demand was offset by declining domestic supply and the effect of demand in asia 

in this environment schlumberger achieved a record high for revenue with strong contributions from all areas international performance was led by the europecisafrica area where revenue was up 18 mainly from strength in russia and in the nigeria  gulf of guinea angola east africa and north sea geomarkets in latin america revenue grew by 17 driven by integrated project management contracts on land and activity for wireline services and drilling group product and services offshore – mainly in the mexico  central america venezuela trinidad  tobago and ecuador geomarkets revenue in the middle east  asia area increased by 13 on strong results in the saudi arabia  bahrain australasia brunei malaysia  philippines and china geomarkets and in north america revenue grew by 12 billion to reach 135 billion driven by a robust 38 increase in demand for deepwater and exploration services offshore particularly in the us gulf of mexico revenue from north america land also improved a modest 4 on strong demand for production group technology although this was tempered by weakness in the hydraulic fracturing market 

all product groups recorded doubledigit revenue growth reservoir characterization revenue of 114 billion increased by 15 with all technologies also posting doubledigit growth driven by offshore exploration activity across the areas drilling group revenue increased 15 to 160 billion led by strong growth in mi swaco drilling  measurements and drilling tools  remedial technologies production group revenue of 149 billion increased 13 with doubledigit growth in well intervention completions and artificial lift technologies well services revenue also increased primarily from offshore activity 

entering 2013 the world macroeconomic environment remains uncertain with the gdp growth outlook unchanged however global oil demand is expected to grow at similar levels to those seen in 2012 and 2011 and supply will see further growth in north america as light tight oil production increases other nonopec production however can be expected to continue to face delays and decline challenges as a result global spare capacity should remain largely unchanged absent any unexpected macroeconomic or geopolitical events and this will support oil prices within the band we have seen since 2011 for natural gas little change is expected in the behavior of the main geographical markets in 2013

the sequential increase in reservoir characterization group revenue resulted mainly from robust international endofyear schlumberger information solutions sis software sales testing services grew for the third successive quarter from higher activity in the saudi arabia  bahrain geomarket petrotechnical services posted doubledigit revenue growth on strong consulting activity in the mexico  central america geomarket westerngeco increased slightly as the endofyear multiclient sales and uniq land seismic technology direct sale in russia were partly offset by a sharp seasonal decline in marine revenue on lower vessel utilization following the seasonal transits out of the north sea wireline revenue grew from increased activity in the us gulf of mexico but this was largely offset by a seasonal activity decline in asia drilling group revenue increased on international and offshore demand for drilling  measurements and mi swaco technologies drilling tools  remedial services also contributed to growth with the fullquarter revenue from radius services ipm improved slightly as the combination of an increase in projects in australia and new startups in iraq and argentina was partly offset by project completions in north africa the increase in production group revenue resulted primarily from stronger completions and artificial lift product year end sales coupled with new framo subsea projects in the us gulf of mexico and in the north sea and angola geomarkets well intervention services revenue also increased on higher activity in the mexico  central america and saudi arabia  bahrain geomarkets well services revenue grew mainly due to higher activity in international and offshore north america markets well services stage count in north america land also increased but revenue declined from continued pricing weakness as a result of hydraulic horsepower oversupply 

among the areas middle east  asia revenue of 26 billion grew 10 sequentially led by the start of new ipm turnkey projects in iraq higher testing well intervention and drilling group services in addition to yearend product sales in the saudi arabia  bahrain geomarket the start of the jurassic seismic project as well as strong product and yearend software sales in kuwait and the increase in ipm onshore projects and strong drilling activity in the australasia geomarket in latin america revenue of 21 billion increased 11 sequentially led by robust yearend software and product sales strong petrotechnical services consulting activity unconventional fracturing and well intervention stimulation activity in the mexico  central america geomarket higher westerngeco vessel utilization for new seismic acquisition surveys in brazil trinidad and uruguay coupled with the start of an ipm project in argentina also contributed to the increase in europecisafrica revenue of 30 billion declined 1 mainly due to lower westerngeco vessel utilization following the seasonal transit of vessels out of the north sea completed ipm projects and service contract delays in north africa and the completion of the westerngeco survey in the kara sea in russia also contributed to the decline the sequential decrease however was partially offset by increased activity in angola and higher product and software sales in the russia and central asia region and the continental europe geomarket north america revenue of 34 billion increased 4 sequentially—mainly from offshore which rose by 24 while land fell by 2 the increase in offshore revenue resulted from both higher drilling activity as the number of deepwater drilling rigs increased and stronger yearend westerngeco multiclient sales the decline in land revenue was mainly due to continued pricing weakness for well services hydraulic fracturing activities a seasonal decline in deviated and horizontal land drilling activity paired with pricing weakness also affected the drilling group segment in north america 

on a worldwide basis fourthquarter pretax operating income of 22 billion increased 1 sequentially international pretax operating income of 16 billion grew 1 while north america pretax operating income of 655 million increased 7 

pretax operating margin of 194 declined 83 basis points bps sequentially international pretax operating margin of 205 declined 104 bps which stemmed from a higherthanusual seasonal slowdown and contractual delays in the europecisafrica area that traditionally attract higher margins in north america pretax operating margin of 192 increased 65 bps sequentially due to the increased contribution of highmargin offshore services particularly in the us gulf of mexico which more than offset margin decline in drilling group and well services activities on land by segment reservoir characterization group pretax operating margin reached 291 while the pretax operating margins of the drilling and production groups were 168 and 150 respectively 

reservoir characterization group 

fourthquarter revenue of 315 billion increased 240 million or 8 sequentially pretax operating income of 917 million was 9 higher sequentially 

revenue increased mainly through robust international endofyear sis software sales while testing services grew for the third successive quarter from higher activity in the saudi arabia  bahrain and mexico  central america 

  

geomarkets petrotechnical services revenue also posted doubledigit growth on strong consulting activity in the mexico  central america geomarket westerngeco increased slightly as the endofyear multiclient sales and uniq land seismic technology direct sale in russia were partly offset by the sharp seasonal decline in marine revenue on lower vessel utilization following seasonal transits out of the north sea wireline grew slightly on increased activity in the us gulf of mexico following the recovery from the activity shutdown associated with hurricane isaac in the previous quarter but this was offset by a seasonal activity decline in asia mainly in the australasia and china geomarkets 

pretax operating margin of 291 increased 31 bps sequentially margin expansion was primarily due to traditionally strong endofyear sales of schlumberger information services sis software and westerngeco multiclient licenses testing services wireline and petrotechnical services margins also expanded on a more favorable technology mix in exploration and development projects these improvements were however subdued by lower westerngeco marine margin as a result of lower vessel utilization 

drilling group 

fourthquarter revenue of 41 billion increased 88 million or 2 sequentially pretax operating income of 696 million was 5 lower sequentially 

revenue increased on international and offshore demand for drilling  measurements and mi swaco products and services drilling tools  remedial services activity also contributed to growth with a fullquarter of revenue for radius services ipm revenue grew slightly as increased projects in australia and new startups in iraq and argentina were partly offset by project completions in north africa the overall revenue increase was tempered by a decline in drillingrelated services mainly in north america land due to a seasonal decline in deviated and horizontal drilling activity coupled with pricing weakness 

pretax operating margin of 168 decreased 128 bps sequentially among the group technologies sequential margins in drilling  measurements and drilling tools  remedial services were flat while margin contractions were recorded at mi swaco and ipm due to geographical mix and operational and startup delays 

production group 

fourthquarter revenue of 39 billion increased 249 million or 7 sequentially pretax operating income of 590 million was 8 higher sequentially 

the increase in revenue resulted primarily from stronger completions and artificial lift product yearend sales coupled with new framo subsea projects in the us gulf of mexico and in the north sea and angola geomarkets well intervention services revenue increased on higher activity in the mexico  central america and saudi arabia  bahrain geomarkets well services revenue grew mainly due to higher activity in the international and the north america offshore markets international activities were strong from stimulation vessel operations in brazil unconventional fracturing activity in mexico and new projects in kuwait and iraq well services stage count in north america land also grew but land revenue declined on continued pricing weakness from the oversupply of hydraulic horsepower 

pretax operating margin increased 13 bps sequentially to 15 the increase was largely attributable to the favorable impact of yearend completions and artificial lift product sales coupled with improved profitability from new framo subsea projects this margin increase was largely offset by continued well services pricing weakness

fullyear 2012 pretax operating income of 83 billion increased 14 yearonyear as international pretax operating income of 58 billion increased 31 while north america pretax operating income of 27 billion declined by 10 yearonyear 

pretax operating margin was essentially flat at 198 as international pretax operating margin expanded 226 bps to 205 while north america pretax operating margin declined 448 bps to 203 europecisafrica posted a 435 bps improvement to reach 196 and latin america increased 175 bps to 184 and middle east  asia reported a 27 bps increase to 234 north america margin decline was due to well services production technologies as a result of pricing pressure and cost inflation 

reservoir characterization group 

fullyear revenue of 1142 billion was 15 higher than the same period last year led by wireline testing services westerngeco and sis technologies driven by improved offshore exploration activities across all areas pretax operating margin increased 345 bps to 281 largely due to the highermargin exploration activities that benefited wireline and testing services higher sis software sales higher westerngeco marine vessel utilization and improved uniq land seismic productivity 

drilling group 

fullyear revenue of 1597 billion was 15 higher than the previous year primarily due to the significantly improved exploration and development activities of mi swaco drilling  measurements and the other drilling group technologies in north america offshore and in the international markets 

pretax operating margin increased 142 bps to 177 primarily due to the increase in highermargin activities of drilling  measurements mi swaco and drilling tools  remedial technologies – all of which benefited from exploration activities in north america offshore and in the international markets – mainly in the europecisafrica area

fullyear 2011 revenue of 370 billion was 39 higher than 2010 primarily reflecting the acquisition of smith on august 27 2010 as well as the significantly improved activity pricing and asset efficiency for well services technologies in north america as the market transitioned to liquidrich plays demanding increasing service intensity in drilling and completing horizontal wells 

yearonyear pretax operating margin increased 79 bps to 198 largely due to the improved pricing and asset efficiency for well services technologies in north america and the resumption of highermargin activity in the us gulf of mexico however the margin expansion was tempered by activity disruptions from the geopolitical unrest in north africa and in the middle east during the first quarter of 2011 

reservoir characterization group 

fullyear revenue of 993 billion was 7 higher than the previous year on stronger wireline activity higher westerngeco marine and multiclient sales and increased sis software sales 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 23 bps to 247 led by margin declines in wireline and testing services largely due to the revenue mix as well as the impact of geopolitical events which prevailed during the first quarter of 2011 the margin decline however was partially offset by a favorable westerngeco multiclient sales mix and improved marine vessel utilization 

drilling group 

fullyear revenue of 1386 billion was 75 higher than the previous year reflecting the acquisitions of smith in august 2010 and geoservices in april 2010 partially offset by a decrease in ipm activities in mexico the rampup of ipm projects in iraq also contributed to the revenue increase 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 32 bps to 163 largely due to the addition of the smith and geoservices activities as well as the effects of the geopolitical events 

production group 

fullyear revenue of 1314 billion was 40 higher than the previous year while pretax operating margin increased 525 bps to 201 well services revenue and margins expanded strongly in north america on higher pricing capacity additions and improved asset utilization and efficiency as the market transitioned to liquidrich plays internationally well services also posted growth on the strength of higher activity despite the exceptional geopolitical events that occurred during the first quarter of 2011 

interest and other income 

interest and other income consisted of the following 

 

 equity income from the mi swaco joint venture in 2010 represented eight months of equity income through the closing of the smith transaction 

interest expense 

interest expense of 340 million in 2012 increased by 42 million compared to 2011 primarily due to the 1 billion of 125 senior notes due 2017 and 1 billion of 240 senior notes due 2022 that schlumberger issued during 2012 

interest expense of 298 million in 2011 increased by 91 million compared to 2010 primarily due to the 46 billion of longterm debt that schlumberger issued during 2011 

  

other 

research  engineering and general  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  were as follows 

 

 although research  engineering decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2011 as compared to 2010 it increased in absolute dollars by 154 million this increase in absolute dollars was driven in large part by the impact of the smith acquisition 

income taxes 

the schlumberger effective tax rate was 240 in 2012 242 in 2011 and 171 in 2010 

the schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease conversely when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase 

the effective tax rate for both 2011 and 2010 was impacted by the charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  excluding the impact of these charges and credits the effective tax rate in 2011 was 238 compared to 205 in 2010 this increase in the effective tax rate excluding the impact of the charges and credits was primarily attributable to the fact that schlumberger generated a larger proportion of its pretax earnings in north america in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of improved market conditions and the effect of a full year’s activity from the acquired smith businesses 

charges and credits 

schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in continuing operations during 2012 2011 and 2010 these charges and credits which are summarized below are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements

 the premium paid in excess of the carrying value to repurchase the 1275 billion of debt was approximately 67 million 

 

   

during the fourth quarter of 2010 schlumberger issued €10 billion 275 guaranteed notes due under this program schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these euro notes for us dollars on the date of issue until maturity effectively making this a us denominated debt on which schlumberger will pay interest in us dollars at a rate of 256 during the first quarter of 2009 schlumberger issued €10 billion 450 guaranteed notes due 2014 under this program schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these euro notes for us dollars on the date of issue until maturity effectively making this a us dollar denominated debt on which schlumberger will pay interest in us dollars at a rate of 495 

 

 the following table summarizes the activity under this share repurchase program during 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

  

 in recent years schlumberger has actively managed its activity levels in venezuela relative to its accounts receivable balance and has recently experienced an increased delay in payment from its national oil company customer there schlumberger operates in approximately 85 countries at december 31 2012 only five of those countries including venezuela individually accounted for greater than 5 of schlumberger’s accounts receivable balance of which only one the united states represented greater than 10 

 

 on january 17 2013 schlumberger announced that its board of directors had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 136 to 03125 

on january 19 2012 schlumberger announced that its board of directors had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 10 to 0275 

on january 21 2011 schlumberger announced that its board of directors had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 19 to 025 

 

  

 schlumberger’s international defined benefit pension plans are a combined 88 funded at december 31 2012 based on the projected benefit obligation this compares to 88 funded at december 31 2011 

schlumberger currently anticipates contributing approximately 650 million to its postretirement benefit plans in 2013 subject to market and business conditions 

 

   

as of december 31 2012 schlumberger had approximately 63 billion of cash and shortterm investments on hand schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating 41 billion with commercial banks of which 38 billion was available and unused as of december 31 2012 this included 35 billion of committed facilities which support commercial paper borrowings in the united states and europe schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months 

schlumberger did not have any commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2012 

summary of major contractual obligations 

 

  

   refer to note 18 pension and other benefit plans of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

as discussed in note 14 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2012 is approximately 145 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 

schlumberger has outstanding letters of creditguarantees which relate to business performance bonds customexcise tax commitments facility leaserental obligations etc these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain a summary of all of schlumberger’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

multiclient seismic data 

the westerngeco business capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december 31 2012 and 2011 was 518 million and 425 million respectively such costs are charged to cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value 

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is 

  

determined that estimated future revenues which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two pools of surveys united states and nonunited states the united states and nonunited states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs certain larger surveys which are typically prefunded by customers are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments adjustments to the allowance may be required 

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill the goodwill relating to each of schlumberger’s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred 

under generally accepted accounting principles schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount then there is no need to perform any further testing however if schlumberger concludes otherwise then it is required to perform the first step of a twostep impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test 

for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill schlumberger’s reporting units are its three groups reservoir characterization drilling and production schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test based on this assessment schlumberger concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying amount accordingly no further testing was required 

longlived assets including fixed assets and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 

income taxes 

schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities these 

  

audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

pension and postretirement benefits 

schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements  the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans 

 

  

  

  

 a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense 

the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for each of the united states and international pension plans was 750 in both 2012 and 2011 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine the 2012 postretirement medical expense was 8 graded to 5 over the next seven years the overall medical trend rate assumption utilized to determine the postretirement medical liability at december 31 2012 was 75 graded to 5 over the next eleven years 

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for the united states and international pension plans 

 

   

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for schlumberger’s united states postretirement medical plans 

 

 investments in affiliated companies 

investments in affiliated companies on the consolidated balance sheet primarily reflects schlumberger’s investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages and are often still defining their strategic direction such investments are inherently risky and their success is dependent on factors such as technology development market acceptance and their ability to raise additional funds the technology being developed by these companies may never materialize and they could fail schlumberger monitors its portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired if an investment is considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired it is written down to its fair value

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  tableend schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger conducts business in approximately 85 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar which is consistent with the oil and gas industry approximately 75 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2012 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will increase 

a 5 increase or decrease in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in 2012 would have changed revenue by approximately 1 if the 2012 average exchange rates of the us dollar against all foreign currencies had strengthened by 5 schlumberger’s income from continuing operations would have increased by approximately 2 conversely a 5 weakening of the us dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income from continuing operations by approximately 2 

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on monetary assetsliabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses 

at december 31 2012 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 75 billion in various foreign currencies of which 39 billion relate to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 

schlumberger is subject to the risk of market price fluctuations of certain commodities such as fuel schlumberger utilizes forward contracts to manage a small percentage of the price risk associated with forecasted fuel purchases as of december 31 2012 43 million of commodity forward contracts were outstanding 

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2012 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 100 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately 16 billion schlumberger has entered into interest rate swaps relating to 05 billion of its fixed rate debt as of december 31 2012 whereby schlumberger will receive interest at a fixed rate and pay interest at a variable rate 

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio both shortterm investments and fixed income investments  held to maturity  which totaled approximately 46 billion at december 31 2012 are comprised primarily of money market funds eurodollar time deposits certificates of deposit commercial paper euro notes and eurobonds and are substantially all denominated in us dollars the average return on investment was 06 in 2012 

the following table represents carrying amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 2012 by year of maturity 

 

   

the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 105 billion as of december 31 2012 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2012 was 36

schlumberger oilfield services operates in each of the major oilfield service markets managing its business through three groups reservoir characterization drilling and reservoir production each group consists of a number of technologybased service and product lines or technologies these technologies cover the entire life cycle of the reservoir and correspond to a number of markets in which schlumberger holds leading positions the business is also managed through four geographic areas north america latin america europecisafrica and middle east  asia within these areas a network of geomarket regions provides logistical technical and commercial coordination 

the role of the groups and technologies is to ensure that schlumberger provides the best possible service delivery to customers and that it remains at the forefront of technology development the groups and technologies are collectively responsible for driving excellence in execution throughout their businesses overseeing operational processes resource allocation personnel and delivering superior financial results the geomarket structure offers customers a single point of contact at the local level for field operations and brings together geographically focused teams to meet local needs and deliver customized solutions the areas and geomarkets are responsible for providing the most efficient and cost effective support possible to the operations 

the groups are as follows 

reservoir characterization group – consists of the principal technologies involved in finding and defining hydrocarbon deposits these include westerngeco wireline testing services schlumberger information solutions and data  consulting services 

 

  

  

  

  

 drilling group – consists of the principal technologies involved in the drilling and positioning of oil and gas wells and comprises bits  advanced technologies mi swaco geoservices drilling  measurements pathfinder drilling

 reservoir production group – consists of the principal technologies involved in the lifetime production of oil and gas reservoirs and includes well services completions artificial lift and well intervention subsea water services carbon services and schlumberger production management field production projects 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 schlumberger oilfield services also offers customers its services through business models known as integrated project management for well construction projects and schlumberger production management for field production projects these models combine the required services and products of the technologies with both drilling rig management expertise and project management skills to provide a complete solution to well construction and production improvement projects are typically of multiyear duration and include startup costs and significant thirdparty components which cover services that schlumberger does not provide directly projects may be fixed price in nature contain penalties for nonperformance and may also offer opportunities for bonus payments where performance exceeds agreed targets integrated project management and schlumberger production management also 

  

provide specialized engineering and project management expertise when schlumberger is requested to include these capabilities with services and products across the technologies in a single contract in no circumstances does schlumberger take any stake in the ownership of oil or gas reserves 

also included in schlumberger oilfield services is schlumberger business consulting which helps oil and gas companies achieve fast and sustainable performance improvements schlumberger business consulting includes indigopool an independent business that provides divestiture advisory and marketing services to the international oil and gas community 

supporting the technologies is a global network of research and engineering centers through this organization schlumberger is committed to advanced technology programs that enhance oilfield efficiency lower finding and producing costs improve productivity maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value while accomplishing these goals in a safe and environmentally sound manner 

schlumberger oilfield services primarily uses its own personnel to market its offerings the customer base business risks and opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all services there is a sharing of manufacturing and engineering facilities as well as research centers and the labor force is interchangeable technological innovation quality of service and price differentiation are the principal methods of competition which varies geographically with respect to the different services offered while there are numerous competitors both large and small schlumberger believes that it is an industry leader in providing wireline logging well testing drilling and completion fluids coiled tubing measurementwhiledrilling loggingwhiledrilling and directionaldrilling services mud logging as well as fully computerized logging and geoscience software and computing services a large proportion of schlumberger offerings is nonrig related consequently revenue does not necessarily correlate to rig count fluctuations 

distribution is an industry leading provider of pipes valves and valve automation fittings mill and tool supplies safety products and artificial lift systems to the energy and industrial markets additionally distribution provides warehouse management vendor integration and various inventory management services the segment comprises the operations of wilson international inc a whollyowned subsidiary and a majority owned interest in ce franklin ltd a publicly traded canadian distribution company

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following discussion of risk factors may be important information in understanding our “forwardlooking statements” which are discussed immediately following item 7a of this form 10k and elsewhere these risk factors should also be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k 

we urge you to consider carefully the risks described below as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k if any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this form 10k were to materialize our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry a substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration development and production of oil and natural gas reserves these expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas declines as well as anticipated declines in oil and gas prices could also result in project modifications delays or cancellations general business disruptions and delays in or nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us these effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors including 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonunited states operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 85 countries in which we operate 

our nonunited states operations accounted for approximately 68 of our consolidated revenue in 2011 76 in 2010 and 84 in 2009 operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries including iran syria sudan and cuba that are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the united states or other governments or organizations united states law enforcement authorities are currently conducting a grand jury investigation and an associated regulatory inquiry related to our operations in certain of these countries additionally in 2009 prior to being acquired by schlumberger smith received an administrative subpoena with respect to its historical business practices in certain countries that are subject to united states trade and economic sanctions if any of the risks described above materialize or if any governmental investigation results in criminal or civil penalties or other remedial measures it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

we are also subject to risks related to investment in our common stock in connection with certain us state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries and similar actions by some private investors which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

our offshore oil and gas operations could be adversely impacted by the deepwater horizon drilling rig accident as resulting changes in and compliance with restrictions or regulations on offshore drilling in the us gulf of mexico and in other areas around the world may adversely affect our business and operating results 

on april 20 2010 a fire and explosion occurred onboard the semisubmersible drilling rig deepwater horizon  owned by transocean ltd and under contract to a subsidiary of bp plc as a result of the incident and related oil spill the secretary of the us department of the interior directed the bureau of ocean energy management regulation and enforcement “boemre” to issue a suspension of deepwater drilling activities which was lifted on october 12 2010 in october 2010 boemre now split into the bureau of ocean energy management and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement issued new guidelines and regulations regarding safety environmental matters drilling equipment and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the us gulf of mexico and may take other additional steps that could result in permitting delays increased costs of exploration and production and reduced areas of operations which could reduce the demand for our services 

at this time we cannot predict with any certainty what further impact if any the deepwater horizon incident may have on the regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity or on the cost or availability of insurance coverage to cover the risks of such operations the enactment of new or stricter regulations in the united states and other countries where we operate could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 

we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials and explosives and to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges and waste management we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex stringent and expensive to implement these laws may provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations 

we could be subject to substantial liability claims which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the technical complexities of our operations are such that we are exposed to a wide range of significant health safety and environmental risks our offerings involve productionrelated activities radioactive materials explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration development and production environments an accident involving these services or equipment or a failure of a product could cause personal injury loss of life damage to property equipment or the environment or suspension of operations our insurance may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events including events involving pollution or against losses resulting from business interruption moreover we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

demand for our products and services could be reduced by changes in governmental regulations or in the law 

international national and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and promulgating climaterelated legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting greenhouse gas emissions such legislation as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or to promote the use of alternative energy sources may significantly curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services which may in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

international national and state governments and agencies are also currently evaluating and promulgating legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas using hydraulic fracturing such legislation or regulations could lead to operational delays and increased costs and therefore reduce demand for our pressure pumping services if additional international national or state legislation or regulations are enacted it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain technology leadership this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold 

if we are unable to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients—in a timely and costcompetitive manner in the various markets we serve it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights including our trade secrets could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold 

some of our products or services and the processes we use to produce or provide them have been granted patent protection have patent applications pending or are trade secrets our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business royalty payments under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs if a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally developing noninfringing technologies would increase our costs 

failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations 

we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases in periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals this could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations 

severe weather conditions may affect our operations 

our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate this may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services in addition if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures this may result in a suspension of activities any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements including without limitation statements relating to our plans strategies objectives expectations intentions and resources such forwardlooking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under “item 1a risk factors” of this report 

executive overview 

after the strong recovery of 2010 when worldwide oil demand grew 27 million barrels per day to 883 million barrels per day corresponding to the largest yearonyear increase in 30 years oil demand grew only by a modest 07 million barrels per day in 2011 this resulted from the combination of economic concerns in the oecd countries and lower growth in the emerging economies on the supply side the unrest in north africa and the middle east and more specifically the shutdown of libyan production from early in the first quarter through the end of the third quarter significantly tightened worldwide production capacity thereby limiting opec spare capacity to its lowest level since 2008 nonopec production remained essentially flat yearonyear as the steady increase in north american liquids production was offset by the declining output of mature basins tight supply maintained sufficient pressure on oil prices to offset sluggish demand growth and yearly average prices set new records 

natural gas markets behaved differently between the three major geographic areas of consumption in north america a continuous increase in unconventional gas production modest demand growth and mild weather at the beginning of the winter season contributed to maintain storage at or above fiveyear highs and keep natural gas prices low in asia the need for alternative energy sources following the fukushima incident along with the fast growing demand in nonoecd economies maintained gas prices high and led to a significant increase in the demand for liquified natural gas in europe despite decreasing demand prices continued to be supported by the influence of asian demand on common suppliers’ prices and by declining production in the north sea 

in this environment schlumberger oilfield services revenue reached a historical high in 2011 of 37 billion—an increase of 39 over 2010 while this reflected a full year of revenue from the acquisitions of smith international in august 2010 and geoservices in april the same year overall business conditions worldwide also improved during the year in north america which grew by 82 compared to 2010 this was seen through increased activity stronger pricing and improved asset utilization as the market continued to shift to the liquidsrich plays that demanded higher service intensity in drilling and completing horizontal wells a gradual return to activity in the deepwater us gulf of mexico which accelerated as the year progressed also contributed to north american results international growth of 24 was marked by strengthening activity in deepwater areas and active exploration basins as well as by signs of pricing traction for certain technologies in the latin america area where revenue grew by 29 drilling and production activity increased europe cis and africa grew by 22 in revenue terms with strength in the north sea and russia but suffered the most in terms of the geopolitical unrest that affected north africa and the middle east with libya shut down from latefebruary until operations recommenced in october revenue in the middle east  asia area increased by 21 driven by improving activity in iraq and saudi arabia although these improvements were slowed by geopolitical unrest 

all three product groups saw improved activity the most substantial gain 73 was recorded by the drilling group due largely to the full year’s revenue from the acquisitions of smith international and geoservices however this was underpinned by growth across almost all drilling group technologies driven by overall activity and pricing gains during the year for drilling  measurements services the rampup in integrated project management ipm well construction projects in iraq also contributed to the growth reservoir production services and products grew by 41 led by well services in north america through higher pricing capacity additions and improved asset utilization and efficiency as the market transitioned to liquidrich plays reservoir characterization grew by 7 led by wireline on activity mix and westerngeco on higher multiclient seismic sales 

market penetration of new technologies in a number of areas also contributed to the year’s performance in reservoir characterization services the growing wave of exploration projects increased demand for the wireline scanner family measurements that provide more complete understanding of difficult and complex formations in many cases complementary technologies deployed included insitu fluid analyzer and quicksilver probe formation fluid testing and sampling services while other advanced wireline technologies were used in the evaluation of unconventional reservoirs westerngeco benefited from this trend with new contracts for coil shooting and dual coil shooting fullazimuth seismic acquisition surveys a type of survey unique to schlumberger 

  

further integration of schlumberger and smith drillingfocused technologies boosted drilling group results in particular the growing use of smith ideas modeling software enabled optimal selection of bottomhole assembly components particularly in matching drillbits to rotary steerable systems among individual product lines smith drillbit technologies benefited from the larger schlumberger geographical footprint while drilling  measurements scope family loggingwhiledrilling services played significant roles in enhancing performance in a number of complex highprofile wells in particular china and russia saw increasing penetration of schlumberger drilling group technologies 

demand for reservoir production technologies was boosted by growing deployment of the hiway channel fracturing service in unconventional and tight reservoir applications around the world by midyear hiway technology had been introduced across all four geographical areas with more than 1200 stages pumped the hiway service is part of the schlumberger approach that achieves more performance with less equipment and resources and this number of stages alone saved over 60000 tons of proppant compared to conventional operations in the fourth quarter stages pumped grew by 50 sequentially and operations were conducted for 35 customers 

a number of small technologybased acquisitions were completed during 2011 in addition to completion of the eurasia drilling company ltd asset swap and strategic alliance announced in 2010 these included the purchase of the remaining equity interest in framo engineering as a privately owned norwegian company specializing in the sales and manufacture of products and services related to multiphase pumps and subsea pump systems multiphase metering systems and swivel and marine systems schlumberger also completed the purchase of thrubit llc a company providing openhole logging services using a unique throughthebit deployment technique that offers a novel way of obtaining wireline logs in horizontal wells in shale plays 

in ipm schlumberger and saxon energy services merged their respective landbased rig fleets resulting in schlumberger rigs and crews operating in oman pakistan and venezuela becoming part of saxon’s operations under the terms of the agreement saxon will also provide technical drilling contracting support to existing schlumberger joint ventures in saudi arabia algeria iraq and venezuela ensuring availability and support to schlumberger well construction activities as part of a stronger focus on the growing production services enhancement market schlumberger production management was formed during the year to increase market participation and became responsible for the casabe and bokor projects that were previously managed by ipm 

for 2012 projected gross domestic product gdp growth continued to be revised downwards during the fourth quarter and positive signs from the us and japan are offset by continued concerns over the eurozone and the potential slowing of growth in china in spite of the political efforts to resolve the issues the uncertainty surrounding the global financial markets is expected to continue in the coming quarters and although the chance of a global doubledip recession remains a possibility this is not expected to be the most likely scenario 

in line with lower gdp growth oil demand outlook has also been revised downwards during the fourth quarter although the increasing weight of the emerging economies the weakness of nonopec supply and a number of geopolitical concerns have supported oil prices absent a global recession these are not expected to weaken significantly for natural gas worldwide little change is expected in the behavior of the main geographical markets in 2012 compared to 2011 

feedback from schlumberger customers and the findings from recently published spending surveys suggest that exploration and production investment in 2012 will be higher than that of 2011 although the predicted levels vary the same surveys suggest that exploration spending will continue to increase 

against this backdrop schlumberger is planning for growth in 2012 although with significant flexibility in north america land rig count is expected to remain flat with 2011 fourthquarter levels provided the ongoing drop in gas rig activity will be countered by increasing activity in liquids and liquidsrich basins a continued recovery in the deepwater gulf of mexico is also expected with strong demand for highvalue technologies in international markets rig count in 2012 is expected to increase by around 10 versus 2011 driven by strong offshore activity in west africa north sea and brazil and by land activity in the middle east north africa and western siberia 

overall schlumberger remains confident that any potential reductions in activity will be shortlived due to limited spare oil capacity and to growing international demand for natural gas further the company believes its competitive position remains strong given its strength in the international market in terms of global footprint and contract portfolio and given the balance that has been established between reservoir characterization drilling and production services in north america 

the following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements

    oilfield services 

fourthquarter revenue of 1030 billion increased 8 sequentially with increases across all groups and geographical areas 

  

sequentially reservoir characterization revenue increased on strong westerngeco multiclient sales in the us gulf of mexico and the angola geomarket together with robust endofyear schlumberger information solutions sis software sales across all areas westerngeco also improved with the resumption of land seismic activity in the middle east and new surveys in north africa wireline reported considerable growth across all geographical areas and particularly on stronger offshore exploration activities in the nigeria  gulf of guinea southern  eastern africa and central  west africa geomarkets drilling revenue increased on higher mi swaco activity in north america land the us gulf of mexico and latin america ipm revenue increased significantly mostly from projects in mexico and iraq while drilling  measurements revenue was higher on improved pricing and strong activity in the us gulf of mexico and the nigeria  gulf of guinea geomarket reservoir production revenue increased driven by stronger completions and artificial lift product sales across all areas in north america land well services grew through capacity additions and continued improvements in asset utilization and crew efficiency in addition framo and schlumberger production management spm posted strong sequential increases 

on a geographical basis north america area revenue grew sequentially on increasing deepwater work in the us gulf of mexico higher rig count and land activity in the us and canada and significant westerngeco multiclient sales in addition well services reported considerable increases from additional fleet deployment and continued improvements in asset utilization and crew efficiency in the latin america area strong revenue was recorded in the mexico  central america geomarket from higher ipm project activities and sis software sales in the venezuela trinidad  tobago geomarket from westerngeco marine seismic activities and in the peru colombia  ecuador geomarket from robust artificial lift product sales in the europecisafrica area strong results were led by the angola geomarket which saw vigorous westerngeco multiclient sales in addition to expanded presalt offshore activity for wireline testing services  drilling  measurements the nigeria  gulf of guinea geomarket which recorded robust completions product sales and higher drilling  measurements and wireline activity and the north africa geomarket that reported higher wireline testing services well services and ipm project activity these increases however were reduced by lower north sea activity which was impacted by seasonal weather issues in the middle east  asia area strong completions and artificial lift product sales and robust sis software sales drove results—particularly in the india geomarket these results were augmented by continued growth in the saudi arabia bahrain geomarket due to the rebound of land seismic acquisition strong rigless activity and land rig additions the oman geomarket grew primarily on higher wireline and artificial lift activities while the iraq geomarket saw an increase in nonproject services in addition to new ipm projects 

pretax operating income of 217 billion increased 12 sequentially over prior quarter pretax operating margin increased 82 basis points bps sequentially to 211 primarily due to the strong sales of westerngeco multiclient licenses sis software and completions products drilling  measurements and wireline also contributed to this sequential improvement through increasing highermargin exploration activities 

reservoir characterization 

fourthquarter revenue of 279 billion was 12 higher sequentially pretax operating income of 777 million was 28 higher compared to the third quarter of 2011 

westerngeco and sis posted significant sequential revenue growth on strong multiclient sales in the us gulf of mexico and the angola geomarket and on robust software sales across all geographical areas respectively westerngeco also improved on the resumption of land seismic activity in the middle east and new surveys in north africa wireline recorded increases across all areas led by stronger offshore exploration activities in the nigeria  gulf of guinea southern  eastern africa and central  west africa geomarkets data  consulting services and testing services also posted gains 

sequentially pretax operating margins increased markedly by 340 bps to 279 through the seasonally strong sales of westerngeco multiclient licenses and sis software increasing highermargin wireline exploration activities also contributed to the growth 

  

drilling 

fourthquarter revenue of 391 billion was 6 higher sequentially pretax operating income of 658 million improved 7 sequentially 

significant sequential revenue growth was recorded by mi swaco from higher rig count on land in the us  canada sustained growth in deepwater activity in the us gulf of mexico and strong contributions in latin america ipm activity increased significantly mainly from projects in mexico and in iraq drilling  measurements revenue increased on improved pricing and strong activity in the us gulf of mexico and the nigeria  gulf of guinea geomarket although this was partially offset by weatherrelated activity reductions in the north sea and east asia geomarkets in addition geoservices and bits  advanced technologies registered robust sequential increases 

sequentially pretax operating margins were up slightly to 168 drilling  measurements obtained increased margins from improved technology mix and service pricing but this was partly offset by the effects of weatherrelated activity delays and reductions most of the other technologies exacted margin expansion following the continued successful integration and expansion of smith geoservices and schlumberger drilling technologies 

reservoir production 

fourthquarter revenue of 360 billion increased 7 over the prior quarter pretax operating income of 768 million was 9 higher sequentially 

among reservoir production group technologies completions and artificial lift posted the strongest sequential growth driven by robust product sales across all areas well services sequential growth was seen mainly in north america land as additional fleets deployed and continued improvements in asset utilization and crew efficiency were achieved although these positive factors were partially muted by the impact of yearend seasonal effects framo and spm also posted strong sequential increases 

sequentially fourthquarter pretax operating margins were slightly up at 213 completions artificial lift and well services reported improvements from strong sales 

fullyear 2011 results 

 

   

 

  

    oilfield services 

fullyear 2011 revenue of 370 billion was 39 higher than 2010 primarily reflecting the acquisition of smith on august 27 2010 as well as the significantly improved activity pricing and asset efficiency for well services technologies in north america as the market transitioned to liquidrich plays demanding increasing service intensity in drilling and completing horizontal wells 

yearonyear pretax operating margin increased 75 bps to 198 largely due to the improved pricing and asset efficiency for well services technologies in north america and the resumption of highermargin activity in the us gulf of mexico however the margin expansion was tempered by activity disruptions from the geopolitical unrest in north africa and in the middle east during the first quarter of 2011 

reservoir characterization 

revenue of 993 billion was 7 higher than the same period last year on stronger wireline activity higher westerngeco marine and multiclient sales and increased sis software sales 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 23 bps to 247 led by margin declines in wireline and testing services largely due to the revenue mix as well as the impact of geopolitical events which prevailed during the first quarter of 2011 the margin decline however was partially offset by a favorable westerngeco multiclient sales mix and improved marine vessel utilization 

drilling 

revenue of 1425 billion was 73 higher than the same period last year reflecting the acquisitions of smith in august 2010 and geoservices in april 2010 partially offset by a decrease in ipm activities in mexico the rampup of ipm projects in iraq also contributed to the revenue increase 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 24 bps to 160 largely due to the addition of the smith and geoservices activities as well as the effects of the geopolitical events 

  

reservoir production 

revenue of 1275 billion was 41 higher than the same period last year while pretax operating margin increased 541 bps to 205 well services revenue and margins expanded strongly in north america on higher pricing capacity additions and improved asset utilization and efficiency as the market transitioned to liquidrich plays internationally well services also posted growth on the strength of higher activity despite the exceptional geopolitical events which prevailed during the first quarter of 2011 

distribution 

revenue of 262 billion increased 185 billion while pretax operating income of 103 million increased 74 million compared to last year these increases are attributable to the fact that 2010 reflected only four months of activity following the smith acquisition 

fullyear 2010 results 

 

 

  

      

oilfield services 

fullyear 2010 revenue of 2667 billion was 17 higher than 2009 this increase was largely attributable to the acquisition of smith as well as significantly higher activity and pricing for well services technologies in us land however these increases were partially offset by lower activity in the us gulf of mexico due to the deepwater drilling moratorium and by lower pricing and activity in europecisafrica 

yearonyear pretax operating margin declined 141 bps to 190 primarily due to the inclusion of the acquired smith businesses as well as the reduced activity and weaker pricing in the europecisafrica area these effects however were partially offset by the impact of the stronger activity and pricing for well services technologies in us land 

reservoir characterization 

revenue of 932 billion was 2 lower than last year westerngeco revenue decreased primarily due to reduced activity and pricing for marine acquisition services which was partially offset by higher sales of wideazimuth multiclient surveys in the us gulf of mexico wireline revenue fell primarily due to the deepwater drilling moratorium in the gulf of mexico and reduced activity and lower pricing in europecisafrica testing services revenue also decreased as a result of lower activity and pricing in europecisafrica these decreases were partially offset by an increase in sis revenue primarily in latin america and north america 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 203 bps to 249 mostly due to the lower activity and pricing for wireline and testing services in europecisafrica and from the impact of the moratorium in the us gulf of mexico 

drilling 

revenue of 823 billion was 40 higher than the previous year this increase was primarily driven from the acquisitions of smith and geoservices during 2010 partially offset by lower revenue for drilling  measurements due to the impact of the deepwater drilling moratorium in the us gulf of mexico and generally lower pricing in international markets 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 496 bps to 162 due to the inclusion of the smith and geoservices technologies as well the lower pricing and activity for drilling  measurements 

reservoir production 

revenue of 905 billion was 24 higher yearonyear mostly from significantly higher pricing and activity for well services technologies in north america and increased gain share from spm field production projects in latin america in addition an 87 million early payout relating to services on an spm gain share project triggered by the customer’s sale of the field also contributed to the revenue growth 

yearonyear pretax operating margin increased 440 bps to 151 primarily due to improved pricing and activity for well services in north america and strong contribution from the spm field production projects the spm gain share early payout mentioned above contributed approximately 55 million to pretax operating income 

interest and other income 

interest and other income consisted of the following 

 

   

equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 

equity income from the mi swaco joint venture in 2010 represents eight months of equity income through the closing of the smith transaction 

interest expense 

interest expense of 298 million in 2011 increased by 91 million compared to 2010 primarily due to the 46 billion of longterm debt that schlumberger issued during 2011 

interest expense of 207 million in 2010 decreased by 14 million compared to 2009 primarily due to a decline in the weighted average borrowing rates from 39 to 32 

other 

research  engineering and general  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  were as follows 

 

 although research  engineering decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2011 as compared to 2010 and in 2010 compared to 2009 it has increased in absolute dollars by 154 million and 117 million respectively these increases in absolute dollars were driven in large part by the impact of the smith acquisition 

income taxes 

the schlumberger effective tax rate was 244 in 2011 173 in 2010 and 196 in 2009 

the schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease conversely when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase 

the effective tax rate for both 2011 and 2010 was impacted by the charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  excluding the impact of these charges and credits the effective tax rate in 2011 was 240 compared to 206 in 2010 this increase in the effective tax rate excluding the impact of the charges and credits was primarily attributable to the fact that schlumberger generated a larger proportion of its pretax earnings in north america in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of improved market conditions and the effect of a full year’s activity from the acquired smith businesses 

the effective tax rate for 2009 was also impacted by the charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  but to a much lesser extent excluding charges and credits the effective tax rate in 2010 was 206 compared to 192 in 2009 this increase is largely attributable to the geographic mix of earnings as well as the inclusion of four months’ results from the acquisition of smith which served to increase the schlumberger effective tax rate 

charges and credits 

schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in continuing operations during 2011 2010 and 2009 these charges and credits which are summarized below are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  

  

the following is a summary of the 2011 charges and credits 

 

 the following is a summary of the 2010 charges and credits 

 

 the following is a summary of the 2009 charges 

 

 cash flow 

net debt represents gross debt less cash shortterm investments and fixed income investments held to maturity management believes that net debt provides useful information regarding the level of schlumberger’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt 

  

details of net debt follow 

 

  

  

 key liquidity events during 2011 2010 and 2009 included 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 the premium paid in excess of the carrying value to repurchase the 1275 billion of debt was approximately 67 million 

 

 during the fourth quarter of 2010 schlumberger issued €10 billion 275 guaranteed notes due under this program schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these euro notes for us dollars on the date of issue until maturity effectively making this a us denominated debt on which schlumberger will pay interest in us dollars at a rate of 256 during the first quarter of 2009 schlumberger issued €10 billion 450 guaranteed notes due 2014 under this program schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these euro notes for us dollars on the date of issue until maturity effectively making this a us dollar denominated debt on which schlumberger will pay interest in us dollars at a rate of 495 

 

  

 the following table summarizes the activity under this share repurchase program during 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

  

 at times in recent periods schlumberger has experienced delays in payments from certain of its customers schlumberger operates in approximately 85 countries at december 31 2011 only four of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5 of schlumberger’s accounts receivable balance of which only one the united states represented greater than 10 

 

 on january 19 2012 schlumberger announced that its board of directors had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 10 to 0275 

on january 21 2011 schlumberger announced that its board of directors had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 19 to 025 

  

  

 schlumberger’s international defined benefit pension plans are a combined 88 funded at december 31 2011 based on the projected benefit obligation this compares to 92 funded at december 31 2010 

schlumberger currently anticipates contributing approximately 600 million to its postretirement benefit plans in 2012 subject to market and business conditions 

 

 as of december 31 2011 schlumberger had approximately 48 billion of cash and shortterm investments on hand schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating 41 billion with commercial banks of which 28 billion was available and unused as of december 31 2011 this included 35 billion of committed facilities which support commercial paper borrowings in the united states and europe schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months 

schlumberger had 09 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2011 

summary of major contractual obligations 

 

  

  refer to note 18 pension and other benefit plans of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

as discussed in note 14 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2011 is approximately 135 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 

schlumberger has outstanding letters of creditguarantees which relate to business performance bonds customexcise tax commitments facility leaserental obligations etc these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain a summary of all of schlumberger’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

multiclient seismic data 

the westerngeco business capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december 31 2011 and 2010 was 425 million and 394 million respectively such costs are charged to cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value 

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two pools of surveys united states and nonunited states the united states and nonunited states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs certain larger surveys which are typically prefunded by customers are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments adjustments to the allowance may be required 

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill the goodwill relating to each of schlumberger’s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred 

under generally accepted accounting principles schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount then there is no need to perform any further testing however if schlumberger concludes otherwise then it is required to perform the first step of a twostep impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

  

schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test 

for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill schlumberger’s four reporting units are the three groups comprising oilfield services reservoir characterization drilling and reservoir production as well as the distribution business segment schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test based on this assessment schlumberger concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying amount accordingly no further testing was required 

longlived assets including fixed assets and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 

income taxes 

schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

pension and postretirement benefits 

schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements  the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans 

 

  

  

  

   

a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense 

the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans was 750 in 2011 and 850 in 2010 the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international plans was 750 in 2011 and 800 in 2010 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine both the 2011 postretirement medical expense as well as the postretirement medical liability as of december 31 2011 was 8 graded to 5 over the next six years 

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for the united states and international pension plans

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger conducts business in approximately 85 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar which is consistent with the oil and gas industry approximately 75 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2011 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will increase 

a 5 increase or decrease in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in 2011 would have changed revenue by approximately 1 if the 2011 average exchange rates of the us dollar against all foreign currencies had strengthened by 5 schlumberger’s income from continuing operations would have increased by approximately 2 conversely a 5 weakening of the us dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income from continuing operations by approximately 2 

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on monetary assetsliabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses 

at december 31 2011 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 69 billion in various foreign currencies of which 39 billion relate to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 

schlumberger is subject to the risk of market price fluctuations of certain commodities such as metals and fuel schlumberger utilizes forward contracts to manage a small percentage of the price risk associated with forecasted metal purchases as of december 31 2011 27 million of commodity forward contracts were outstanding 

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2011 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 80 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately 19 billion schlumberger has entered into interest rate swaps relating to 05 billion of its fixed rate debt as of december 31 2011 whereby schlumberger will receive interest at a fixed rate and pay interest at a variable rate 

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio both shortterm investments and fixed income investments  held to maturity  which totaled approximately 34 billion at december 31 2011 are comprised primarily of money market funds eurodollar time deposits certificates of deposit commercial paper euro notes and eurobonds and are substantially all denominated in us dollars the average return on investment was 11 in 2011 

the following table represents carrying amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 2011 by year of maturity 

 

 the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 84 billion as of december 31 2011 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2011 was approximately 280 

schlumberger does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes

 item 1a   risk factors 

 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” which are discussed immediately following item 7a of this form 10k these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k 

 

we urge you to consider carefully the risks described below as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in form 10k if any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this form 10k were to materialize our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry a substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration development and production of oil and natural gas reserves these expenditures are generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas declines as well as anticipated declines in oil and gas prices could also result in project modifications delays or cancellations general business disruptions and delays in or nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us these effects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

the prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and may be affected by a variety of factors including 

 

  

the oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

part i item 1a 

 

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonunited states operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 80 countries in which we operate 

 

our nonunited states operations accounted for approximately 76 of our consolidated revenue in 2010 84 in 2009 and 78 in 2008 operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 

 

  

in addition we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries including iran syria sudan and cuba that are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the united states or other governments or organizations united states law enforcement authorities are currently conducting a grand jury investigation and an associated regulatory inquiry related to our operations in certain of these countries additionally in 2009 prior to its merger with schlumberger smith received an administrative subpoena with respect to its historical business practices in certain countries that are subject to united states trade and economic sanctions if any of the risks described above materialize or if any governmental investigation results in criminal or civil penalties or other remedial measures it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

we are also subject to risks related to investment in our common stock in connection with certain us state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries and similar actions by some private investors which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

our merger with smith will continue to be dilutive to our earnings per share in the near term which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

 

our merger with smith will continue to be dilutive to earnings per share in the near term future events and conditions could decrease or delay any accretion result in dilution or cause greater dilution than is currently expected including adverse changes in

any dilution of or decrease or delay of any accretion to our earnings per share could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

 

our offshore oil and gas operations could be adversely impacted by the deepwater horizon drilling rig accident and resulting oil spill changes in and compliance with restrictions or regulations on offshore drilling in the us gulf of mexico and in other areas around the world may adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

on april 20 2010 a fire and explosion occurred onboard the semisubmersible drilling rig deepwater horizon  owned by transocean ltd and under contract to a subsidiary of bp plc as a result of the incident and related oil spill the secretary of the us department of the interior directed the bureau of ocean energy management regulation and enforcement “boemre” to issue a suspension until november 30 2010 of drilling activities for specified drilling configurations and technologies although this moratorium was lifted on october 12 2010 effective immediately we cannot predict with certainty when drilling operations will fully resume in the us gulf of mexico the boemre has also issued new guidelines and regulations regarding safety environmental matters drilling equipment and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the us gulf of mexico and may take other additional steps that could increase the costs of exploration and production reduce the area of operations and result in permitting delays 

at this time we cannot predict with any certainty what further impact if any the deepwater horizon incident may have on the regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity or on the cost or availability of insurance coverage to cover the risks of such operations ongoing effects of and delays from the lifted suspension of drilling activity in the us gulf of mexico or the enactment of new or stricter regulations in the united states and other countries where we operate could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 

 

we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials and explosives environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges and waste management we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex stringent and expensive to implement these laws may provide for “strict liability” for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations 

 

we could be subject to substantial liability claims which would adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

certain equipment used in the delivery of oilfield services such as directional drilling equipment perforating systems subsea completion equipment radioactive materials and explosives and well completion systems are used in hostile environments such as exploration development and production applications an accident or a failure of a product could cause personal injury loss of life damage to property equipment or the environment and suspension of operations our insurance may not protect us against liability for some kinds of events including events involving pollution or against losses resulting from business interruption moreover in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate substantial claims made under our policies could cause our premiums to increase any future damages caused by our products that are not covered by insurance or 

part i item 1a 

 

are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

if we are unable to maintain technology leadership this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold 

 

if we are unable to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in the form of service offerings in a timely and costcompetitive manner in the various markets we serve it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights including our trade secrets could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold 

 

some of our products or services and the processes we use to produce or provide them have been granted patent protection have patent applications pending or are trade secrets our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets 

 

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights 

 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business royalty payments under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs if a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally developing noninfringing technologies would increase our costs 

 

failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations 

 

we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases in periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals this could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations 

 

severe weather conditions may affect our operations 

 

our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate this may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services in addition if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures this may result in a suspension of activities until the platforms or structures have been repaired any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

demand for our products and services could be reduced or eliminated by governmental regulation or a change in the law 

 

international national and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and promulgating climaterelated legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions in the united states the environmental protection agency “epa” is taking steps to require monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions and to regulate ghgs as pollutants under the clean air act “caa” the epa’s “mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases” rule established a comprehensive scheme of regulations that require monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions that began in 2010 furthermore the epa recently proposed additional ghg reporting rules specifically for the oil and gas industry the epa has also published a final rule the “endangerment finding” finding that ghgs in the atmosphere endanger public health and welfare and that emissions of ghgs from mobile sources cause or 

part i item 1a 

 

contribute to the ghg pollution following issuance of the endangerment finding the epa promulgated final motor vehicle ghg emission standards on april 1 2010 the epa has asserted that the final motor vehicle ghg emission standards will trigger construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources in addition climate change legislation is pending in the united states congress these developments may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services which may in turn adversely affect future results of operations additionally legislation to reduce greenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on our operations including payment of additional costs due to carbon emissions higher carbon emission activities include transportation including marine vessels cement production by third party suppliers and electricity generation by third party suppliers as well as other activities finally our business could be negatively affected by climate change related physical changes or changes in weather patterns which could result in damages to or loss of our physical assets impacts to our ability to conduct operations andor disruption of our customers’ operations 

legislation may be introduced in the united states congress that would authorize the epa to regulate hydraulic fracturing in addition a number of states are evaluating the adoption of legislation or regulations governing hydraulic fracturing such legislation or regulations could reduce demand for pressure pumping services if federal andor state legislation or regulations were enacted it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are unable to predict whether the proposed legislation regulations or any other proposals will ultimately be enacted

executive overview 

 

after two consecutive years of falling oil demand in 2008 and 2009 induced by the global economic recession a strong recovery occurred in 2010 consumption averaged 877 million barrels per day including an alltime peak of over 89 million barrels per day in december and made the yearonyear increase the second largest in three decades oil prices remained in the range of 6585 per barrel for much of 2010 but recorded a spike above 90 at the end of the year the major demand forecasts released during 2010 have continued to increase as a result of the improving economic outlook – particularly in the developing economies on the supply side the adherence to production quota by the opec countries helped keep the market balanced although such adherence diminished slightly as the year progressed strength in nonopec production improvement in new project developments following the investment cuts in 2009 and lower production costs helped provide additional assurance to the markets 

natural gas markets behaved differently decreasing gas demand during the recession increasing unconventional gas production in north america and the commissioning of a number of new large liquefied natural gas export facilities around the world led to an oversupplied market with consequent pressure on spot prices within the united states – the world’s largest natural gas market – natural gas storage levels have remained significantly above the fiveyear range since march 2010 despite lower volumes of canadian gas imports and some power generation fuel switching from coal to gas with natural gas price forecasts from the energy information agency for 2011 slipping by nearly a third compared to initial projections made at the beginning of the year an increasing portion of the drilling and completion activity in shale reservoirs has shifted to liquid and condensaterich plays in north america 

within this market schlumberger oilfield services fullyear revenue in 2010 of 2208 billion grew 8 versus 2009 driven by recovery in the north america natural gas market through increasing demand and stronger pricing for pressure pumping services the north america area also benefited from greater activity in liquidsrich plays in a number of basins offshore the tragic macondo accident in the us gulf of mexico led to a shutdown in deepwater operations that severely impacted us offshore activity and led to slowdowns in other parts of the world although these were being absorbed as the fourth quarter developed the middle east and asia area revenue climbed 7 from a number of factors including increasing wireline logging and expanded ipm work latin america revenue grew by 2 with rapid growth in brazil overcoming weaker activity in mexico as poor weather increasing security concerns and reduced client budgets impacted operations europecisafrica revenue decreased 4 versus 2009 among the technologies growth was primarily seen in well services activities both in volume and in price although the acquisition of geoservices also contributed to the increase 

in addition to growing activity results were underpinned through continuing market penetration of newtechnology services such as scope advanced loggingwhiledrilling measurements scanner wireline technologies and active coiledtubing services scanner services were boosted by the commercial introduction of the latest family member the dielectric scanner tool which was unveiled during the year as a unique industry service capable of measuring saturation in a variety of reservoir applications the service completed a twoyear pilot project in saudi arabia targeted at reservoir monitoring where 35 logs were recorded in various fields both on land and offshore to assess water flooding sweep efficiency as an aid to field development planning 

in reservoir production active realtime coiled tubing services saw growth particularly with active conveyance of wireline flow scanner production logging technology and with fiberoptic continuous measurements of temperature and pressure along the well bore growing deployment of integrated technologies such as these confirms exciting growth possibilities across the schlumberger technology portfolio particularly in horizontal and extendedreach wells 

it was however drilling services that displayed early evidence of the opportunities provided by the acquisitions of geoservices and smith international that were announced during the first quarter these successes included the completion of a remote threewell exploration project offshore greenland that used schlumberger technologies combined with smith and mi swaco products and services as well as geoservices mud logging in brazil a similar combination of services helped one well record substantial increases in rates of penetration while meeting all 

part ii item 7 

 

directional drilling goals in this particular case the integrated nature of the bottomhole assembly demonstrated how technology optimization can impact performance in the highcost deepwater drilling environment a third such operation offshore indonesia further displayed the value of integrated bottomhole assemblies 

westerngeco revenue of 199 billion in 2010 was 6 lower than 2009 primarily as a result of lower marine activity and weaker pricing while land activity was also weaker strong multiclient sales particularly in the fourth quarter were able to offset some of these effects new seismic technology scored some significant successes with penetration of marine singlevessel fullazimuth coil shooting surveys into a number of the major offshore basins around the world coil shooting unique to schlumberger brings better illumination of complex presalt subsalt and subbasalt formations in a variety of environments 

the integration of geoservices and smith international proceeded smoothly during the year the complementary nature of many of the product and service lines concerned helped the process while a network of integration teams and area coordinators rapidly identified revenue and costsynergy opportunities that contributed to results in 2010 and that augur well for 2011 total schlumberger 2010 results reflect four months activity from the acquired smith businesses which contributed revenue of 330 billion 

in a related move schlumberger signed a letter of intent with eurasia to swap certain assets in russia to build critical mass in drilling services under the terms of this agreement eurasia will acquire a number of schlumbergerowned drilling rigs while schlumberger will acquire a range of eurasia service assets including directional drilling measurementwhiledrilling well cementing and drilling fluids further both companies agreed to enter a strategic alliance upon completion of the transaction whereby schlumberger will become the preferred supplier of drilling services to eurasia drilling for up to 200 rigs for a 5year period this agreement not only increases the market for our services across the rig fleet of the largest russian drilling company it also encourages the development of fitforpurpose bottomhole assembly technology development as drilling intensity increases in russia in order to sustain hydrocarbon production 

two years ago we began a program called “excellence in execution” this was designed to create a step change in our service quality and efficiency and in deepwater was aimed at enabling clients to reduce the risk and cost of their deepwater operations the program in addition to equipment and procedural improvements provides for competency certification of all personnel involved in deepwater operations we have been encouraged by the initial results of this multiyear initiative as well as by our customers’ acceptance of it while additional control and oversight will undoubtedly add cost this will be offset in the long run by improvements in operating procedures and technology we therefore welcome current efforts to better understand and control the risks associated with deepwater operations 

for 2011 economic projections for world real gdp growth are converging towards a median estimate of 42 slightly lower than the 2010 level and still with a significant level of uncertainty a large gap exists between gdp growth rates of organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and nonoecd countries – particularly in china and in other developing asian economies however there is remarkable agreement on various oil demand forecasts for 2011 which all lie within 14 million barrels per day of each other 

as we look forward to 2011 it is therefore important to remember that the primary driver of our business has always been and will remain the demand for oil and gas oil prices have moved into a range that will encourage increased investment particularly in exploration which remains the swing factor in operators’ budgets while we do not anticipate any substantial recovery in deepwater us gulf of mexico we do expect a marked increase in deepwater activity in the rest of the world these factors coupled with increases in development activity and production enhancement in many other areas promise stronger growth rates as the year unfolds 

for natural gas activity in the united states is likely to remain strong – at least through the first half of the year – due to the commitments necessary to retain leases the backlog of wells to be completed and the contribution of natural gas liquids to overall project economics increased service capacity however will negatively affect pricing at some stage during the year 

overseas the governing factor on gas activity particularly in the middle east will be the ability of many nations to use gas as a substitute for oil to meet increased local energy demand thus freeing up more liquids for export elsewhere the long lead time necessary to execute large gas projects for lng exports will ensure that a certain level of activity is maintained 

unconventional gas resources will continue to attract considerable interest outside north america the leading activity will continue to be in conventional gas in tight or low permeability reservoirs and in coalbed methane 

part ii item 7 

 

developments there will be exploration activity around the potential that shale gas offers in many other parts of the world 

increased activity coupled with the greater technology needs of higher exploration deepwater and tight gas activity – particularly outside north america – will make 2011 a stronger year for schlumberger the importance of risk reduction and the minimization of drilling cost make the acquisitions of geoservices and smith major contributors to our future growth in this scenario 

 

the following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  

 

fourth quarter 2010 results 

 

 

 

 

  

oilfield services 

 

fourthquarter revenue of 601 billion increased 9 sequentially sequentially north america area revenue increased 27 on strong activity on land in the us and canada as well as from the early payout of an ipm gain share project in the middle east  asia area revenue grew on yearend equipment schlumberger information solutions sis software sales and on higher activity in the iraq east asia and indonesia geomarkets europecisafrica area revenue increased from stronger activity in the north sea west  south africa caspian and continental europe geomarkets as well as from yearend sis software sales these increases were partially offset by a decrease in latin america area revenue primarily due to continuing weakness in the mexicocentral america geomarket 

all technologies recorded sequential growth most notably well services due to continuing strong activity in north america and sis and artificial lift from yearend sales ipm revenue also increased as a result of the early payout on the ipm project in north america 

part ii item 7 

 

fourthquarter pretax operating income of 133 billion increased 21 sequentially pretax operating margin increased 224 bps sequentially to 221 primarily driven by the robust performance in north america and strong contributions from the yearend equipment and software sales 

 

north america 

 

fourthquarter revenue of 160 billion increased 27 sequentially and pretax operating income of 385 million was 75 higher 

sequentially revenue in us land grew 24 versus a 4 increase in rig count due to a combination of additional service capacity improved utilization and high service intensity that mostly benefited well services technologies canada revenue grew from higher land activity for well services although this was partially offset by a slowdown in offshore activity that impacted drilling  measurements services the us gulf of mexico revenue increased through a modest improvement in shelf activity and from completion systems equipment sales an 87 million early payout relating to services on an ipm gain share project – triggered by the customer’s sale of the field – also contributed to area growth 

pretax operating margin for the area increased 658 bps sequentially to 240 this increase was largely driven by us land through stronger activity and increased efficiency for well services operations the ipm gain share payout contributed approximately 55 million to area pretax operating income 

 

latin america 

 

fourthquarter revenue of 105 billion decreased 2 versus the prior quarter pretax operating income of 174 million increased 9 compared to the third quarter of 2010 

sequentially the brazil geomarket achieved record high revenue on strong deepwater activity while revenue in the perucolombiaecuador geomarket grew from higher gain share on ipm activity in colombia and from testing services equipment sales in peru these increases however were insufficient to offset a significant revenue drop in the mexicocentral america geomarket where continuing security issues and client budgetary constraints further reduced ipm activity levels 

pretax operating margin improved 171 bps sequentially to 166 primarily due to a more favorable revenue mix in the perucolombiaecuador and venezuelatrinidad  tobago geomarkets 

 

europecisafrica 

 

fourthquarter revenue of 178 billion increased 3 compared to the third quarter of 2010 pretax operating income of 339 million increased 7 sequentially 

sequentially revenue in the north sea geomarket increased primarily from higher activity in norway and from yearend sis software sales in the west  south africa geomarket revenue grew on stronger activity that benefited wireline and drilling  measurements services and on higher completion systems equipment sales caspian geomarket revenue increased from the startup of several projects that resulted in higher demand for drilling  measurements testing services and wireline technologies as well as from a well services equipment sale continental europe revenue grew on higher activity for well services and testing services technologies and on yearend sis software sales these increases however were partially offset by a decrease in nigeria  gulf of guinea geomarket revenue from lower completion systems equipment sales and from delays that reduced demand for wireline services russia revenue was also lower with the onset of the winter slowdown 

pretax operating margin improved sequentially by 74 bps to 190 primarily from a stronger mix of highmargin wireline and drilling  measurements services in the north sea and west  south africa geomarkets as well as from yearend sis software sales across much of the area these increases were partially offset by the impact of the activity weakness in the nigeria  gulf of guinea geomarket 

 

middle east  asia 

 

fourthquarter revenue of 149 billion increased 6 sequentially pretax operating income of 434 million increased 2 sequentially 

part ii item 7 

 

sequentially revenue growth resulted from the continued ramp up of ipm activity in iraq and the start of new offshore projects in east asia yearend sales of artificial lift and completion systems equipment well services products and sis software also contributed to area growth these increases were partially offset by lower revenue in the australiapapua new guinea geomarket resulting from offshore project completions and delays in land activity due to severe flooding and by lower activity in the qatar geomarket that reduced demand for wireline and drilling  measurements services 

pretax operating margin decreased 119 bps sequentially to 291 as the positive contribution from the yearend sales and a more favorable revenue mix in the arabian geomarket were insufficient to offset the impact of the lower activity in the australiapapua new guinea geomarket and startup costs in iraq 

 

westerngeco 

 

fourthquarter revenue of 560 million increased 17 sequentially pretax operating income of 113 million increased 183 sequentially 

sequentially revenue growth was driven by multiclient which recorded strong yearend sales from the us gulf of mexico this increase was partially offset by a decrease in marine revenue due to the seasonal slowdown in activity land and data processing revenues were flat sequentially 

pretax operating margin increased 118 percentage points sequentially to 202 as the result of the high multiclient sales partially offset by the impact of the lower marine activity 

 

fullyear 2010 results 

 

 

 

 

  

oilfield services 

 

fullyear 2010 revenue of 2208 billion was 8 higher than 2009 revenue growth was strongest in the north america area mostly as a result of higher activity and pricing for well services technologies in us land but partially offset by 

part ii item 7 

 

reduced activity in the us gulf of mexico latin america revenue increased on strong activity in the brazil and peruecuadorcolombia geomarkets partially offset by reduced ipm activity in mexicocentral america due to client budgetary constraints middle east  asia area revenue grew from higher drilling activity in the australiapapua new guinea chinajapankorea and east asia geomarkets as well as from increased ipm activity and strong demand for well services technologies in the middle eastern geomarkets the addition of geoservices also contributed to the increased revenue these increases were partially offset by a decrease in europecisafrica revenue as reduced activity in the north africa libya caspian and continental geomarkets and generally lower pricing across the area offset higher activity in russia 

yearonyear pretax operating margin declined 82 bps to 203 as a significant improvement in north america area performance was insufficient to offset the reduced activity and weaker pricing in the europecisafrica area and lower ipm activity in latin america 

 

north america 

 

revenue of 501 billion was 35 higher than last year primarily due to strong activity in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs improved pricing in us land for well services technologies and improved activity levels in oil basins in canada these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the us gulf of mexico revenue as a sixmonth moratorium on drilling and lingering uncertainty about rules for operating resulted in the stoppage of deepwater drilling activity 

yearonyear pretax operating margin increased 10 percentage points to 160 mostly due to the stronger activity and improved pricing in the us land partially offset by the impact of the activity slowdown in the us gulf of mexico 

 

latin america 

 

revenue of 432 billion was 2 higher than the previous year growth was strongest in the brazil geomarket where higher offshore activity increased demand for wireline and drilling  measurements services technologies revenue also increased significantly in the peruecuadorcolombia geomarket due to strong ipm activity and higher artificial lift systems sales the addition of geoservices also contributed to the growth these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the mexicocentral america geomarket revenue as client budgetary constraints reduced ipm activity 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 110 bps to 167 primarily due to the reduced activity levels in mexicocentral america partially offset by the impact of lower costs in venezuelatrinidad  tobago 

 

europecisafrica 

 

revenue of 688 billion was 4 lower yearonyear this decrease was largely attributable to lower pricing across much of the area and reduced activity in the north africa libya caspian and continental europe geomarkets these decreases were partially offset by increases in russia due to higher ipm activity the addition of geoservices also contributed to area revenue 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 543 bps to 184 primarily due to the lower overall activity levels and reduced pricing 

 

middle east  asia 

 

revenue of 559 billion was 7 higher than the previous year primarily due to strong drilling activity in asia particularly in the australiapapua new guinea chinajapankorea and east asia geomarkets and to increased ipm activity and strong demand for well services technologies in the middle eastern geomarkets the addition of geoservices also increased area revenue 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 199 bps to 304 primarily due the impact of lower pricing across the area 

 

westerngeco 

 

fullyear 2010 revenue of 199 billion was 6 lower than the prior year primarily due to reduced activity and pricing in marine this decrease was partially offset by an increase in multiclient revenue as the result of increased acquisition and sales of wideazimuth surveys in the us gulf of mexico 

part ii item 7 

 

yearonyear pretax operating margin decreased 194 bps to 134 as the result of the lower pricing and activity in marine and reduced profitability in land and data processing these decreases were partially offset by an improvement in multiclient margins on the increased activity 

 

fullyear 2009 results 

 

 

 

 

  

oilfield services 

 

fullyear 2009 revenue of 2052 billion declined 16 versus 2008 lower natural gas prices and unfavorable market fundamentals resulted in a 37 decline in north america revenue primarily in the us land and canada geomarkets europecisafrica revenue decreased 13 mainly due to the weakening of local currencies against the us dollar and reduced activity in the russia north sea west  south africa and caspian geomarkets as well as in framo which was partially offset by increased activity in the north africa geomarket middle east  asia revenue also fell by 9 primarily due to decreases in the east asia east mediterranean arabian and australiapapua new guinea geomarkets latin america revenue was only marginally lower than last year as the impact of the weakening of local currencies against the us dollar and much lower activity in venezuelatrinidad  tobago and perucolombiaecuador were nearly offset by stronger activity in mexicocentral america and brazil weakening of local currencies against the us dollar reduced 2009 revenue by approximately 4 across the areas all of the technologies recorded revenue declines except testing services ipm recorded revenue growth compared to the same period last year 

fullyear 2009 pretax operating margin decreased 57 percentage points to 211 on the significant drop in activity and pricing pressure experienced across all the areas but most notably in north america 

 

north america 

 

revenue of 371 billion was 37 lower than last year with reductions across the entire area the decreases were highest in us land and canada where lower natural gas prices resulted in a steep drop in activity and consequent pressure on pricing canada revenue was also lower as the result of the weakening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar revenue in the us gulf of mexico geomarket was severely impacted by weaker shelf drilling activity and strong pricing pressure 

 

pretax operating margin fell 173 percentage points to 58 due to the significant decline in activity levels across the area combined with the severe pricing erosion 

part ii item 7 

 

latin america 

 

revenue of 422 billion was marginally lower compared to 2008 the weakening of local currencies against the us dollar reduced 2009 revenue by approximately 3 in addition venezuelatrinidad  tobago revenue fell due to significantly reduced customer spending while perucolombiaecuador revenue was lower due to reduced gain share in ipm projects these decreases were mostly offset by higher ipm activity in mexicocentral america and increased offshore activity in brazil 

pretax operating margin decreased 245 bps to 178 primarily as the result of the sharp activity decline in venezuelatrinidad  tobago and the lower gain share in perucolombiaecuador 

 

europecisafrica 

 

revenue of 715 billion was 13 lower than last year largely due to the weakening of local currencies against the us dollar which reduced revenue by approximately 7 in addition revenue was negatively impacted by reduced customer spending that resulted in significantly lower activity and pricing erosion in russia and the north sea revenue in the west  south africa and caspian geomarkets and in framo was also negatively impacted by lower activity levels these decreases were partially offset by a revenue increase in the north africa geomarket due to strong testing services product sales 

pretax operating margins declined 357 bps to 239 on a combination of the overall lower activity and heavy pricing pressure across the area 

 

middle east  asia 

 

revenue of 523 billion was 9 below 2008 revenue was down across much of the middle east especially in the east mediterranean and arabian geomarkets due to reduced demand for drilling  measurements wireline and testing services technologies revenue in asia also fell primarily due to a decrease in offshore exploration activity which was most significant in the east asia and australiapapua new guinea geomarkets resulting in lower demand for testing services and wireline technologies as well as completion systems products 

pretax operating margin decreased 268 bps to 324 primarily as a result of the lower overall activity and a less favorable revenue mix across the area 

 

westerngeco 

 

fullyear revenue of 212 billion was 25 lower than 2008 revenue decreased across all product lines with the largest declines experienced in marine and multiclient marine revenue declined due to lower activity combined with reduced pricing as the result of weak market conditions multiclient revenue decreased primarily in north america as customers continued to reduce discretionary spending land revenue fell on lower crew utilization while data processing revenue was down reflecting lower activity primarily in europeafrica and in north america 

pretax margin decreased 141 percentage points to 154 primarily due to the weaker marine activity and pricing as well as lower multiclient sales 

 

interest and other income 

 

interest and other income consisted of the following 

 

 

part ii item 7 

 

interest income 

 

the average return on investments decreased to 12 in 2010 from 14 in 2009 and the weighted average investment balance of 40 billion in 2010 decreased 05 billion compared to 2009 

the average return on investments decreased to 14 in 2009 from 35 in 2008 and the weighted average investment balance of 45 billion in 2009 increased 11 billion compared to 2008 

 

equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 

 

equity income from the mi swaco joint venture in 2010 represents eight months of equity income through the closing of the smith transaction the decrease in equity income relating to this joint venture from 2008 to 2009 was attributable to a significant decline in mi swaco activity levels primarily in its united states and europeafrica regions as well as increased pricing pressures 

 

interest expense 

 

interest expense of 207 million in 2010 decreased by 14 million compared to 2009 due to a decline in the weighted average borrowing rates from 39 to 32 the weighted average debt balance of 64 billion in 2010 increased 08 billion compared to 2009 

interest expense of 221 million in 2009 decreased by 26 million compared to 2008 primarily due to a decline in the weighted average borrowing rates from 45 to 39 

 

other 

 

gross margin was 217 240 and 302 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

the decline in gross margin in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the acquired smith businesses as well as pricing pressure for oilfield services particularly in the europecisafrica area partially offset by improved activity levels and pricing in the north america area 

the decline in gross margin in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to lower activity coupled with the impact of a significant reduction in pricing across all of oilfield services most notably in north america and europecisafrica weaker marine activity and pricing and reduced multiclient sales in westerngeco also contributed to the margin decline 

research  engineering and general  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  were as follows 

 

 

 

research  engineering expenditures were as follows 

 

 

 

income taxes 

 

the schlumberger effective tax rate was 173 in 2010 196 in 2009 and 209 in 2008 

the schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease conversely when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase 

part ii item 7 

 

the effective tax rate for 2010 was significantly impacted by the charges and credits described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  the effective tax rate for 2009 was also impacted by charges but to a much lesser extent excluding charges and credits the effective tax rate in 2010 was approximately 206 compared to 192 in 2009 this increase is largely attributable to the geographic mix of earnings as well as the inclusion of four months results from the merger with smith smith which as a us company has a us tax rate applicable to its worldwide operations and as such will serve to increase schlumberger’s overall effective tax rate 

the decrease in the schlumberger effective tax rate in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings schlumberger generated a lower proportion of its pretax earnings in north america in 2009 as compared to 2008 in addition outside north america various geomarkets with lower tax rates contributed a greater percentage to pretax earnings in 2009 as compared to 2008 

 

charges and credits 

 

schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in continuing operations during 2010 2009 and 2008 these charges and credits which are summarized below are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements

the premium paid in excess of the carrying value to repurchase the 1275 billion of debt was approximately 67 million 

 

  

schlumberger issued €10 billion 275 guaranteed notes due 2015 in the fourth quarter of 2010 under this program schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these euro notes for us dollars on the date of issue until maturity effectively making this a us denominated debt on which schlumberger will pay interest in us dollars at a rate of 256 the proceeds from these notes will be used for general corporate purposes 

 

during the first quarter of 2009 schlumberger issued €10 billion 450 guaranteed notes due 2014 under this program schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these euro notes for us dollars on the date of issue until maturity effectively making this a us dollar denominated debt on which schlumberger will pay interest in us dollars at a rate of 495 the proceeds from these notes were used to refinance existing debt obligations and for general corporate purposes 

 

  

on april 17 2008 the schlumberger board of directors approved an 8 billion share repurchase program for shares of schlumberger common stock to be acquired in the open market before december 31 2011 of which 315 billion had been repurchased as of december 31 2010

part ii item 7 

 

  

at times in recent periods schlumberger has experienced delays in payments from certain of its customers schlumberger operates in approximately 80 countries at december 31 2010 only three of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5 of schlumberger’s accounts receivable balance of which only one the united states represented greater than 10 

 

  

in january 2011 schlumberger announced that its board of directors had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 19 to 025 

 

  

schlumberger’s international defined benefit pension plans are a combined 92 funded at december 31 2010 based on the projected benefit obligation this compares to 85 funded at december 31 2009 

 

schlumberger currently anticipates contributing approximately 600 million to 650 million to its postretirement benefit plans in 2011 subject to market and business conditions 

 

  

 

 

at december 31 2008 there were no outstanding series a debentures there were 321 million outstanding series b debentures at december 31 2009 during 2010 320 million of the 2125 series b convertible debentures due june 1 2023 were converted by holders into 80 million shares of schlumberger common stock and the remaining 1 million of outstanding series b debentures were redeemed for cash 

as of december 31 2010 schlumberger had approximately 50 billion of cash and shortterm investments on hand schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating 60 billion with commercial banks of which 37 billion was available and unused as of december 31 2010 this included 49 billion of committed facilities which support commercial paper borrowings in the united states and europe schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next twelve months 

schlumberger’s total outstanding debt at december 31 2010 was 81 billion and included approximately 19 billion of commercial paper borrowings the total outstanding debt increased approximately 26 billion compared to december 31 2009 

on january 10 2011 schlumberger issued 11 billion of 4200 senior notes due 2021 and 500 million of 2650 senior notes due 2016

summary of major contractual obligations 

 

 

 

 

  

refer to note 18 of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

as discussed in note 14 of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2010 is approximately 117 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 

schlumberger has outstanding letters of creditguarantees which relate to business performance bonds customexcise tax commitments facility leaserental obligations etc these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain a summary of all of schlumberger’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

multiclient seismic data 

 

the westerngeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december 31 2010 and 2009 was 394 million and 288 million respectively such costs are charged to cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value 

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two pools of surveys united states and nonunited states the united states and nonunited states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that 

part ii item 7 

 

influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs certain larger surveys which are typically prefunded by customers are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments adjustments to the allowance may be required 

 

inventory reserves 

 

inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value schlumberger maintains a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this requires management to make assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory may be required 

 

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

 

schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of schlumberger’s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill schlumberger’s reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the oilfield services segment in addition to the westerngeco mi swaco smith oilfield and distribution segments schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis andor applying various market multiples determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions schlumberger’s estimate of the fair value of each of its reporting units comprising oilfield services as well as its westerngeco reporting unit were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of their annual goodwill impairment tests for 2010 due to the fact that the mi swaco smith oilfield and distribution reporting units were acquired on august 27 2010 just prior to their annual goodwill impairment tests the fair value of these reporting units approximated their carrying value 

longlived assets including fixed assets and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 

 

income taxes 

 

schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the over 100 jurisdictions in which it conducts business these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience 

part ii item 7 

 

and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

 

pension and postretirement benefits 

 

schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements  the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans 

 

  

a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense 

the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans was 850 in both 2010 and 2009 the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international plans was 800 in 2010 and 835 in 2009 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine both the 2010 postretirement medical expense as well as the postretirement medical liability as of december 31 2010 was 8 graded to 5 over the next six years 

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for the united states and international pension plans

item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger conducts business in approximately 80 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar which is consistent with the oil and gas industry approximately 80 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2010 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will increase 

a 5 increase or decrease in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in 2010 would have changed revenue by approximately 1 if the 2010 average exchange rates of the us dollar against all foreign currencies had strengthened by 5 schlumberger’s income from continuing operations would have increased by approximately 2 conversely a 5 weakening of the us dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income from continuing operations by approximately 3 

although the functional currency of schlumberger’s operations in venezuela is the us dollar a portion of the transactions are denominated in local currency for financial reporting purposes such transactions are remeasured into us dollars at the official exchange rate which until january 2010 was fixed at 215 venezuela bolivares fuertes per us dollar despite significant inflation in recent periods in january 2010 venezuela’s currency was devalued and a new exchange rate system was announced during the first quarter of 2010 schlumberger began to apply an exchange rate of 43 venezuelan bolivares fuertes per us dollar to its local currency denominated transactions in venezuela the devaluation did not have an immediate significant impact to schlumberger further although this devaluation does result in a reduction in the us dollar reported amount of local currency denominated revenues and expenses the impact is not material to schlumberger’s consolidated financial statements 

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on monetary assetsliabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses 

at december 31 2010 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 73 billion in various foreign currencies 

schlumberger is subject to the risk of market price fluctuations of certain commodities such as metals and fuel schlumberger utilizes forward contracts to manage a small percentage of the price risk associated with forecasted metal purchases as of december 31 2010 12 million of commodity forward contracts were outstanding 

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2010 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 54 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately 28 billion schlumberger has entered into interest rate swaps relating to 05 billion of its fixed rate debt as of december 31 2010 whereby schlumberger will receive interest at a fixed rate and pay interest at a variable rate 

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio both shortterm investments and fixed income investments  held to maturity  which totaled approximately 37 billion at december 31 2010 are comprised primarily of money market funds eurodollar time deposits certificates of deposit commercial paper euro notes and eurobonds and are substantially all denominated in us dollars the average return on investment was 11 in 2010 

part ii item 7a 

 

the following table represents carrying amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 2010 by year of maturity 

 

 

 

the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 55 billion as of december 31 2010 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2010 was approximately 10

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” which are discussed immediately following item 7a of this form 10k these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k 

  

we urge you to carefully consider the risks described below as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in form 10k if any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this form 10k were to materialize our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry our customers’ capital expenditures may decline in 2010 and beyond if current global economic conditions continue or worsen this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

the current global economic downturn has reduced worldwide demand for oil and natural gas and resulted in significantly lower crude oil and natural gas prices compared to their record highs in july 2008 it is difficult to predict how long the global economic downturn will continue or to what extent this will continue to affect us the significant decline in oil and natural gas prices reduced many of our customers’ activities and spending on our services and products in 2009 this reduction in our customers’ activities and spending could continue through 2010 and beyond demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration development and production of oil and natural gas reserves these expenditures are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas the worldwide deterioration in the financial and credit markets which began in the second half of 2008 resulted in diminished demand for oil and gas and significantly lower oil and natural gas prices this caused many of our customers to reduce or delay their oil and gas exploration and production spending in 2009 which consequently reduced the demand for our services and exerted downward pressure on the prices of our services and products if the economic downturn 

  

part 1 item 1a 

  

  

continues for a prolonged period or if there is little or no economic growth it will likely result in further reductions of exploration and production expenditures by our customers causing further declines in the demand for and prices of our services and products this could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the reduction in cash flows being experienced by our customers resulting from declines in commodity prices together with the reduced availability of credit and increased costs of borrowing could have significant adverse effects on the financial condition of some of our customers this could result in project modifications delays or cancellations general business disruptions and delay in or nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

the prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonunited states operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 80 countries in which we operate 

  

our nonunited states operations accounted for approximately 84 of our consolidated revenue in 2009 78 in 2008 and 76 in 2007 operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

part 1 item 1a 

  

  

in addition we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries including iran syria sudan and cuba which are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the united states or other governments or organizations united states law enforcement authorities are currently conducting a grand jury investigation and an associated regulatory inquiry related to our operations in certain of these countries 

if any of the risks described above materialize or if any governmental investigation results in criminal or civil penalties or other remedial measures it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

we are also subject to risks related to investment in our common stock in connection with certain us state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries and similar actions by some private investors which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 

  

we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials and explosives environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges and waste management we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex stringent and expensive to implement these laws may provide for “strict liability” for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations 

  

we could be subject to substantial liability claims which would adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

certain equipment used in the delivery of oilfield services such as directional drilling equipment perforating systems subsea completion equipment radioactive materials and explosives and well completion systems are used in hostile environments such as exploration development and production applications an accident or a failure of a product could cause personal injury loss of life damage to property equipment or the environment and suspension of operations our insurance may not adequately protect us against liability for some kinds of events including events involving pollution or against losses resulting from business interruption moreover in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate substantial claims made under our policies could cause our premiums to increase any future damages caused by our products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

part 1 item 1a 

  

  

if we are unable to maintain technology leadership in the form of services and products this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold 

  

if we are unable to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in the form of services and products in a timely and costcompetitive manner in the various markets we serve it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights including our trade secrets could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold 

  

some of our products or services and the processes we use to produce or provide them have been granted patent protection have patent applications pending or are trade secrets our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets 

  

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights 

  

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business royalty payments under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs if a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally developing noninfringing technologies would increase our costs 

  

failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations 

  

we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases in periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals this could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations 

  

severe weather conditions may affect our operations 

  

our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate this may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services in addition if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures this may result in a suspension of activities until the platforms or structures have been repaired any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

executive overview 

  

as 2009 progressed oil prices recovered gradually from levels under 40 per barrel at the beginning of the year to over 70 per barrel by yearend the large drop in oil demand in 2009 that resulted from the global economic recession together with increased production capacity in spite of significant delays in new development projects led to spare oil production capacity reaching its highest level in nearly two decades however the decisions by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec at the end of 2008 to cut production the adherence of the majority of opec countries to production quotas and the improving economic outlook contributed to rising prices with stabilization at current levels during 2009 the demand forecasts of the major energy organizations evolved with economic projections falling to a low of nearly 83 million barrels of oil per day bopd in may then increasing gradually by 15 million bopd toward the end of the year the final forecast figure of 844 million bopd represented the second consecutive yearonyear drop in oil demand for the first time in 25 years for 2010 economic projections for world real gdp growth are converging towards a median estimate of 3 but with a significant level of uncertainty a large gap exists between gdp growth rates of organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and nonoecd countries – particularly in china and in other developing asian economies overall oecd country demand will remain at its lowest level in over a decade but this will be compensated by growth in china south east asia and the middle east from a supply standpoint the level of uncertainty in oil demand and oil prices led ep customers to cut investment in 2009 – particularly in projects with the highest production costs – but forecasts published at the end of the year indicated a likely rise in investment in 2010 

the natural gas markets behaved differently from oil markets in 2009 the combination of the drop in gas demand that resulted from reduced industrial activity the rise in production of unconventional gas resources in north america and the commissioning of a number of new large lng liquefied natural gas exporting facilities around the world contributed to an oversupplied market with consequent pressure on spot gas prices on a perbritish thermal unit basis the ratio of oil to henry hub gas prices increased to its highest level in the last four decades threatening the linkage mechanisms in future longterm supply contracts within the united states the world’s largest natural gas market and despite some fuel switching in power generation from coal to gas and lower canadian gas imports natural gas storage levels have been significantly above the fiveyear range consistently since april 2009 consequently natural gas wellhead prices have reached their lowest levels since 2002 this has translated into the largest sustained drop in gasrelated drilling and service activity since the 20012002 period nevertheless the technological success associated with production from unconventional gas reservoirs in the united states is leading to an increasing level of interest in similar formations outside north america particularly in europe which could lead to an expansion in activity when natural gas prices rebound 

within this market schlumberger oilfield services fullyear revenue in 2009 declined 16 versus 2008 falling to 2052 billion lower natural gas prices and unfavorable market fundamentals led to a 37 decline in north america revenue primarily in the us land and canada geomarkets europecisafrica revenue fell 13 mainly due to the weakening of local currencies against the us dollar and reduced activity in the russia north sea west  south africa and caspian geomarkets as well as at framo engineering this decline however was partially offset by increased activity in the north africa geomarket middle east  asia revenue dropped 9 primarily due to decreases in the east asia east mediterranean arabian and australiapapua new guinea geomarkets latin america revenue was only marginally lower than last year as the impact of the weakening of

local currencies against the us dollar and much lower activity in venezuelatrinidad  tobago and peru colombiaecuador was nearly offset by stronger activity in mexicocentral america and brazil weakening of local currencies against the us dollar reduced 2009 revenue by approximately 4 across the areas all of the technologies recorded revenue declines except testing services ipm recorded revenue growth compared to 2008 

while customers spent less on new technology in 2009 versus the previous year a number of recently introduced schlumberger services made further market progress powerdrive family rotarysteerable drilling systems extended their market reach entering new markets in the north and latin america scanner family services for advanced formation evaluation saw success in mexico and canada and well services recorded market penetration in saudi arabia abu dhabi and malaysia with the range of active realtime coiledtubing services that improve operating efficiency and well performance through the innovative use of fiberoptic cable to convey downhole information to the surface 

investment in oilfield services infrastructure continued throughout the year significant events included the opening of a new reservoir completions manufacturing center in damman saudi arabia representing an investment of 25 million the center houses a team of design and manufacturing engineers specialized in the production of downhole reservoir completions equipment the center also provides a collaborative environment in which joint oil company and schlumberger teams can develop and manufacture completions solutions for application across saudi arabia and the middle east in brazil we announced the signing of a joint cooperation agreement with the universidade federal do rio de janeiro to build a key international research center on the university’s campus this new center will focus on research and development activities in the deepwater subsalt environment with emphasis on the development of geosciences software for the exploration and production sector new technologies to meet reservoir challenges in subsalt environments and the creation of a geophysical processing and interpretation center of excellence covering timelapse seismic and combined electromagnetic and seismic measurements 

a number of technology agreements and acquisitions were completed during the year to enable future product development or improve geographical reach in may schlumberger acquired techsia sa a supplier of petrophysical software based in montpellier france techsia will become the schlumberger petrophysics software center of excellence for the development of stateoftheart solutions for the oil and gas exploration and production industry in september schlumberger and national oilwell varco announced the creation of a joint venture to provide highspeed drill string telemetry systems to improve the efficiency and safety of oil and gas operations the venture is expected to accelerate development and delivery of intelligent drilling solutions through the expanded use of the intelliserv ® broadband network a patented technology that provides high resolution data in real time to and from the bottom of oil and gas wells as they are being drilled in november schlumberger acquired lonkar services – a company providing slickline casedhole wireline and surface well testing services in western canada and northern usa also in november schlumberger signed a global cooperation agreement with technip to jointly develop subsea integrity and surveillance solutions for the flexible pipes used in deep offshore oil and gas production this agreement will initially focus on surveillance systems activities for new and challenging flexible pipe applications such as those required in the deepwater subsalt environment in brazil 

fullyear 2009 revenue of westerngeco was at 212 billion 25 lower than 2008 revenue decreased across all product lines with the largest declines seen in marine and multiclient activity marine revenue fell on lower activity combined with reduced pricing as a result of weak market conditions multiclient revenue decreased primarily in north america as customers continued to reduce discretionary spending land revenue fell on lower crew utilization while data processing revenue decreased reflecting lower activity primarily in europeafrica and in north america 

towards the end of the year westerngeco announced the deployment of the nextgeneration uniq integrated pointreceiver land seismic acquisition and processing system in kuwait for the kuwait oil company the new system designed for greater operational efficiency and flexibility offers up to four times

the capability of existing qland systems and is currently acquiring data from 53000 live pointreceiver channels in conjunction with the westerngeco dx80 desert explorer with md sweep technology introduced the previous year 

the outlook for 2010 remains largely dependent on the prospects for the general economy at the end of the third quarter of 2009 we indicated that we were encouraged that signs were emerging that demand for oil and gas would begin to increase consensus forecasts now predict that oil demand in 2010 will increase particularly in the developing world for the first time since 2007 

as a result we feel that oil prices are likely to be sustained at current levels and that as our customers’ confidence grows their exploration and production budgets will increase we feel that considerable leverage to increase investment exists in offshore markets in russia as well as in certain emerging investment opportunities such as iraq these events will be dependent on continued increases in economic growth in the second half of the year beyond the current government stimulus packages 

for natural gas activity we remain a great deal more cautious despite signs of some recovery in industrial demand as well as the recent cold weather we consider that markets remain generally oversupplied increased lng flows together with further capacity being added in 2010 as well as the general uncertainty over the decline rates of unconventional gas production have the potential to limit the current increase in the north american gas drilling rig count 

we anticipate that 2010 will be a better year for multiclient seismic and for activity in land seismic particularly in middle east and north africa while marine activity is expected to be reasonably robust pricing improvements will be limited due to continued new capacity additions 

longer term we remain confident that considerably increased spending will be necessary to maintain sufficient reserves and production of hydrocarbons to meet the world’s needs our technology portfolio and worldwide infrastructure mean we are strongly positioned to capture growth opportunities as our customers begin to increase their investment 

the following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  

  

fourth quarter 2009 results 

  

   

pretax operating income represents the segments’ income before taxes and noncontrolling interests the pretax operating income excludes such items as corporate expenses and interest income and interest expense not allocated to the segments as well as the charges described in detail in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  interest on postretirement medical benefits and stockbased compensation costs 

fourthquarter revenue was 574 billion versus 543 billion in the third quarter of 2009 income from continuing operations attributable to schlumberger was 817 million – an increase of 4 sequentially 

oilfield services fourthquarter revenue of 517 billion was up 4 compared to the third quarter of 2009 sequential pretax segment operating income of 101 billion was down 3

oilfield services 

  

fourthquarter revenue of 517 billion increased 4 sequentially with all areas except europecisafrica contributing to the improvement sequential growth was driven by increased deepwater and explorationrelated activity leading to demand for wireline testing services and drilling  measurements technologies while growth was also recorded on land in north america primarily from increased well services activity in addition seasonal yearend strength was seen in software and product sales in a number of geomarkets – in particular for sis software and artificial lift products these increases however were partially offset by lower activity in russia and in the mexicocentral america geomarket 

fourthquarter pretax operating income of 101 billion was down 3 sequentially pretax operating margin decreased 157 basis points bps sequentially to 195 primarily due to lower activity coupled with a less favorable revenue mix in russia and in the mexicocentral america geomarket pricing concessions made earlier in the year also contributed to the sequential decrease in margins 

  

north america 

  

fourthquarter revenue of 873 million was 6 higher sequentially pretax operating income of 180 million was down 35 sequentially 

sequentially us land geomarket revenue grew on increased drilling activity the impact of which was partially diluted by lower pricing for well services technologies us gulf of mexico geomarket revenue was up marginally as improved shelf activity and the beginning of a buildup in deepwater activity were hampered by downtime associated with hurricane ida as well as by some pricing pressure canada revenue was flat while alaska geomarket revenue fell sequentially due to a slowdown in activity resulting from operator budget constraints 

pretax operating margin decreased 129 bps sequentially to 21 as the increased activity in the us land and gulf of mexico geomarkets was insufficient to offset the impact of a less favorable revenue mix in canada and lower activity in the alaska geomarket 

  

latin america 

  

fourthquarter revenue of 113 billion increased 5 sequentially pretax operating income of 178 million was down 9 sequentially 

sequentially perucolombiaecuador geomarket revenue grew primarily on greater demand for drilling  measurements wireline and testing services technologies resulting from increased drilling activity higher sis software and artificial lift product sales also contributed to this growth brazil revenue was higher due to increased offshore exploration activity as well as to sis software and completions product sales venezuelatrinidad  tobago geomarket recorded growth mainly from integrated project management ipm activity while argentinaboliviachile revenue was higher due to increased activity and sis product sales these increases were partially offset by a decrease in mexicocentral america revenue as a result of reduced activity 

pretax operating margin decreased 254 bps sequentially to 158 primarily as the result of the reduced activity and a less favorable revenue mix in the mexicocentral america geomarket which was only partly offset by the impact of increased activity and software and product sales in the rest of the area 

  

europecisafrica 

  

fourthquarter revenue of 178 billion was flat sequentially pretax operating income of 385 million was down 9 sequentially 

sequentially nigeria  gulf of guinea geomarket revenue grew as the result of strong testing services product sales and an increase in exploration activity that led to greater demand for wireline services in the west  south africa geomarket revenue increased on high demand for drilling  measurements services the

north sea geomarket also recorded growth from increased well services stimulation activity while libya geomarket revenue increased on higher deepwater testing services and wireline exploration activity these increases however were partially offset by lower revenue in russia as a result of client budgetary constraints which mainly affected ipm activity revenue was also lower in the north africa geomarket on reduced testing services product sales and in the caspian geomarket on the completion of drilling campaigns 

pretax operating margin decreased 208 bps sequentially to 216 largely as the result of the lower activity in russia 

  

middle east  asia 

  

fourthquarter revenue of 131 billion increased 7 sequentially pretax operating income of 426 million was 9 higher sequentially 

sequentially revenue growth was driven by an increase in deepwater and explorationrelated activity that led to strong demand for wireline services seasonal yearend sis software and artificial lift product sales also contributed to the increase in revenue 

pretax operating margin improved 66 bps sequentially to 324 primarily as the result of the more favorable mix of deepwater and explorationrelated activity in addition to yearend sis software sales 

  

westerngeco 

  

fourthquarter revenue of 549 million increased 19 sequentially pretax operating income of 115 million increased 89 sequentially 

sequential revenue growth was led by multiclient which recorded strong yearend sales of wideazimuth surveys in the us gulf of mexico land revenue also grew due to increased activity in the middle east and north africa these increases however were partially offset by a significant decrease in marine as the result of weaker pricing project startup delays and vessel transits 

pretax operating margin improved 776 bps sequentially to 209 primarily as a result of the high multiclient sales that were partially offset by the impact of the lower pricing and project delays in marine

fullyear 2009 pretax operating margin decreased 57 percentage points to 211 on the significant drop in activity and pricing pressure experienced across all the areas but most notably in north america 

  

north america 

  

revenue of 371 billion was 37 lower than last year with reductions across the entire area the decreases were highest in us land and canada where lower natural gas prices resulted in a steep drop in activity and consequent pressure on pricing canada revenue was also lower as the result of the weakening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar revenue in the us gulf of mexico geomarket was severely impacted by weaker shelf drilling activity and strong pricing pressure 

pretax operating margin fell 173 percentage points to 58 due to the significant decline in activity levels across the area combined with the severe pricing erosion 

  

latin america 

  

revenue of 422 billion was marginally lower compared to 2008 the weakening of local currencies against the us dollar reduced 2009 revenue by approximately 3 in addition venezuelatrinidad  tobago revenue fell due to significantly reduced customer spending while perucolombiaecuador revenue was lower due to reduced gain share in ipm projects these decreases were mostly offset by higher ipm activity in mexicocentral america and increased offshore activity in brazil 

pretax operating margin decreased 245 bps to 178 primarily as the result of the sharp activity decline in venezuelatrinidad  tobago and the lower gain share in perucolombiaecuador 

  

europecisafrica 

  

revenue of 715 billion was 13 lower than last year largely due to the weakening of local currencies against the us dollar which reduced revenue by approximately 7 in addition revenue was negatively impacted by reduced customer spending that resulted in significantly lower activity and pricing erosion in russia and the north sea revenue in the west  south africa and caspian geomarkets and in framo was also negatively impacted by lower activity levels these decreases were partially offset by a revenue increase in the north africa geomarket due to strong testing services product sales 

pretax operating margins declined 357 bps to 239 on a combination of the overall lower activity and heavy pricing pressure across the area 

  

middle east  asia 

  

revenue of 523 billion was 9 below 2008 revenue was down across much of the middle east especially in the east mediterranean and arabian geomarkets due to reduced demand for drilling  measurements wireline and testing services technologies revenue in asia also fell primarily due to a decrease in offshore exploration activity which was most significant in the east asia and australiapapua new guinea geomarkets resulting in lower demand for testing services and wireline technologies as well as completion systems products 

pretax operating margin decreased 268 bps to 324 primarily as a result of the lower overall activity and a less favorable revenue mix across the area

fullyear 2008 results 

  

   

oilfield services 

  

fullyear 2008 revenue of 2428 billion increased 20 versus 2007 driven by area growth of 28 in latin america 24 in europecisafrica 18 in middle east  asia and 11 in north america all technologies experienced doubledigit growth most notably in well services drilling  measurements and wireline 

pretax operating income of 650 billion in 2008 was 9 higher than 2007 however pretax operating margin declined 256 bps to 268 primarily due to reduced pricing for well stimulation services in the us land geomarkets a higher mix of lowmargin thirdparty managed services in the mexicocentral america geomarket and cost inflation across all areas 

  

north america 

  

revenue of 591 billion grew 11 versus 2007 growth was led by the us land west geomarket mostly due to increased gas shale activity that resulted in robust demand for well services and drilling  measurements technologies and by the us land central geomarket on higher rig activity and strong artificial lift product sales the canada geomarket revenue was higher from demand for well services and drilling  measurements technologies while the us gulf of mexico geomarket grew on increased deepwater activity the resulted in strong demand for drilling  measurements and wireline services in addition to completion systems products 

pretax operating margin decreased 557 bps to 232 primarily as the result of lower pricing for well stimulation services in the us land geomarkets and cost inflation across the area 

  

latin america 

  

revenue of 423 billion was 28 higher than 2007 on doubledigit growth across all geomarkets the mexicocentral america geomarket increased on significantly higher ipm activity while the perucolombiaecuador geomarket also experienced increased ipm activity in addition to robust demand for wireline services and for artificial lift products and sis software the brazil geomarket grew on higher offshore activity that resulted in stronger demand for well testing wireline and well services technologies the venezuelatrinidad and tobago geomarket experienced increased demand for wireline drilling  measurements and well services activities 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

pretax operating margin of 203 declined 262 bps versus 2007 as a result of an increased mix of lowmargin thirdparty managed services in the mexicocentral america geomarket and cost inflation across the area 

  

europecisafrica 

  

revenue of 818 billion increased 24 versus the same period last year growth was led by russia which experienced strong demand for wireline well services and drilling  measurements technologies the west  south africa north sea and caspian geomarkets grew on increased explorationrelated services as well as strong demand for well services technologies the continental europe geomarket was higher due to strong drillingrelated activities and demand for sis offerings the consolidation of framo also contributed to the increase 

pretax operating margin decreased 112 bps to 274 primarily as a result of reduced pricing in the libya geomarket and a less favorable revenue mix in the nigeria  gulf of guinea geomarket and russia the consolidation of framo also reduced total area margin 

  

middle east  asia 

  

revenue of 572 billion was 18 higher than the prior year all geomarkets experienced growth most notably in the arabian australiapapua new guineanew zealand gulf and east mediterranean geomarkets among the technologies growth was strongest in wireline drilling  measurements well services and well testing 

pretax operating margin was nearly flat at 350 as the positive impact of the higher overall activity level was offset by cost inflation 

  

westerngeco 

  

fullyear 2008 revenue of 284 billion was 4 lower than 2007 multiclient revenue was down primarily as the result of significantly lower client discretionary spending in the fourth quarter of 2008 while land decreased on lower crew utilization these decreases were partially offset by increases in marine as a result of additional vessel capacity and higher pricing and in data processing which experienced a growth in activity in all geographic areas 

pretax operating margin of 295 decreased 634 bps due to significantly lower multiclient sales reduced land activity and cost inflation that affected marine operations 

revenue backlog was 18 billion at december 31 2008 compared to 12 billion at december 31 2007 

  

interest and other income 

  

interest and other income consisted of the following 

  

   

   

interest income 

  

the average return on investments decreased to 14 in 2009 from 35 in 2008 and the weighted average investment balance of 45 billion in 2009 increased 11 billion compared to 2008 

the average return on investments decreased to 35 in 2008 from 52 in 2007 and the weighted average investment balance of 34 billion in 2008 increased 286 million compared to 2007

equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 

  

the equity in net earnings of affiliated companies primarily represents schlumberger’s share of the results of its 40 interest in the mi swaco drilling fluids joint venture with smith international inc schlumberger’s equity income from this joint venture was 131 million in 2009 210 million in 2008 and 178 million in 2007 the decrease in equity income relating to this joint venture from 2008 to 2009 was attributable to a significant decline in mi swaco activity levels primarily in its united states and europeafrica regions as well as increased pricing pressures 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense of 221 million in 2009 decreased by 26 million compared to 2008 due to a decline in the weighted average borrowing rates from 45 to 39 the weighted average debt balance of 56 billion in 2009 increased 148 million compared to 2008  

interest expense of 247 million in 2008 decreased by 28 million compared to 2007 due to a decline in the weighted average borrowing rates from 50 to 45 the weighted average debt balance of 55 billion in 2008 was essentially flat compared to 2007  

  

other 

  

gross margin was 234 302 and 335 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

the decline in gross margin in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to lower activity coupled with the impact of a significant reduction in pricing across all of oilfield services most notably in north america and europecisafrica weaker marine activity and pricing and reduced multiclient sales in westerngeco also contributed to the margin decline 

the decline in gross margin percentage in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to the following factors reduced pricing for well stimulation services in the us land geomarkets a higher mix of lowmargin thirdparty managed services in the mexicocentral america geomarket significantly lower multiclient sales in westerngeco and the impact of cost inflation across all areas within oilfield services as well as the marine operations of westerngeco 

research  engineering marketing and general  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  were as follows 

  

   

research  engineering expenditures by segment were as follows 

  

   

income taxes 

  

the schlumberger effective tax rate was 196 in 2009 209 in 2008 and 219 in 2007 

the schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease conversely when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

the decrease in the schlumberger effective tax rate over the past two years has been primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings schlumberger has generated a lower proportion of its pretax earnings in north america in each of the last two years in addition outside north america various geomarkets with lower tax rates have contributed a greater percentage to pretax earnings 

  

charges and credits 

  

schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in continuing operations during 2009 2008 and 2007 these charges and credits which are summarized below are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements

the reduction in cash flows experienced by some of schlumberger’s customers as a result of global economic conditions could have significant adverse effects on their financial condition this could result in among other things delay in or nonpayment of amounts that are owed to schlumberger which could have a material adverse effect on schlumberger’s results of operations and cash flows at times in recent quarters schlumberger has experienced delays in payments from certain of its customers schlumberger operates in approximately 80 countries at december 31 2009 only three of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5 of schlumberger’s accounts receivable balance of which only one represented greater than 10

summary of major contractual obligations 

  

   

   

part ii item 7 

  

  

   

refer to note 19 of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

as discussed in note 15 of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 is approximately 103 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 

schlumberger has outstanding letters of creditguarantees which relate to business performance bonds customexcise tax commitments facility leaserental obligations etc these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain a summary of all of schlumberger’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

multiclient seismic data 

  

the westerngeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december 31 2009 and 2008 was 288 million and 287 million respectively such costs are charged to cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value 

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two pools of surveys united states and nonunited states the united states and nonunited states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs certain larger surveys which are typically prefunded by customers are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value a significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments adjustments to the allowance may be required 

  

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

  

schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of schlumberger’s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill schlumberger’s reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the oilfield services segment in addition to the westerngeco segment schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis andor applying various market multiples determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions schlumberger’s estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units were significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for 2009 2008 and 2007 

longlived assets including fixed assets and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 

  

income taxes 

  

schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the over 100 jurisdictions in which it conducts business these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

pension and postretirement benefits 

  

schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements  the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans 

  

   

   

   

   

a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense 

the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans was 850 in both 2009 and 2008 the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international plans was 835 in 2009 and 800 in 2008 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine both the 2009 postretirement medical expense as well as the postretirement medical liability as of december 31 2009 was 8 graded to 5 over the next six years 

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for the united states and international pension plans

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger conducts business in approximately 80 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar which is consistent with the oil and gas industry approximately 80 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2009 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will increase 

a 5 increase or decrease in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in 2009 would have changed revenue by approximately 1 if the 2009 average exchange rates of the us dollar against all foreign currencies had strengthened by 5 schlumberger’s income from continuing operations would have increased by approximately 4 conversely a 5 weakening of the us dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income from continuing operations by approximately 4 

although the functional currency of schlumberger’s operations in venezuela is the us dollar a portion of the transactions are denominated in local currency for financial reporting purposes such transactions are remeasured into us dollars at the official exchange rate which until january 2010 was fixed at 215 venezuelan bolivares fuertes per us dollar despite significant inflation in recent periods in january 2010 venezuela’s currency was devalued and a new currency exchange rate system was announced schlumberger is in the process of evaluating what exchange rate will apply to schlumberger’s local currency denominated transactions such rate is expected to be between 26 and 43 venezuelan bolivars fuertes per us dollar schlumberger does not expect the immediate impact of this devaluation to have a significant impact on its first quarter 2010 results of operations going forward although this devaluation will result in a reduction in the us dollar reported amount of local currency denominated revenues and expenses the impact will not be material to schlumberger’s consolidated financial statements 

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options to provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on monetary assetsliabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses 

at december 31 2009 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 43 billion in various foreign currencies 

schlumberger is subject to the risk of market price fluctuations of certain commodities such as metals and fuel schlumberger utilizes forward contracts to manage a small percentage of the price risk associated with forecast metal purchases as of december 31 2009 4 million of commodity forward contracts were outstanding 

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates at 

  

part ii item 7a 

  

  

december 31 2009 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 42 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately 13 billion schlumberger has entered into interest rate swaps relating to 11 billion of its fixed rate debt as of december 31 2009 whereby schlumberger will receive interest at a fixed rate and pay interest at a variable rate 

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio both shortterm investments and fixed income investments  held to maturity  which totaled approximately 51 billion at december 31 2009 are comprised primarily of money market funds eurodollar time deposits certificates of deposit commercial paper euro notes and eurobonds and are substantially all denominated in us dollars the average return on investment was 14 in 2009 

  

the following table represents principal amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 2009 by year of maturity 

  

   

the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 46 billion as of december 31 2009 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2009 was approximately 17 

schlumberger does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed immediately following item 7a of this report these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this report or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 

  

we urge you to carefully consider the risks described below as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report if any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report were to materialize our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations 

  

demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry current global economic conditions have resulted in a significant decline in oil and gas prices if current global economic conditions and the availability of credit worsen or continue for an extended period this could reduce our customers’ levels of expenditures and have a significant adverse effect on our revenue and operating results 

  

  

part 1 item 1a 

  

  

the current global credit and economic environment has reduced worldwide demand for energy and resulted in significantly lower crude oil and natural gas prices a substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices can reduce our customers’ activities and their spending on our services and products demand for the majority of our services substantially depends on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves these expenditures are sensitive to oil and natural gas prices and generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and gas prices as the worldwide deterioration in the financial and credit markets has deepened in recent months demand for oil and gas has reduced dramatically and oil and gas prices have fallen sharply causing some of our customers to start to reduce or delay their oil and gas exploration and production spending this has started to reduce the demand for our services and has begun to exert downward pressure on the prices that we charge if economic conditions continue to deteriorate or do not improve it could result in further reductions of exploration and production expenditures by our customers causing further declines in the demand for our services and products this could result in a significant adverse effect on our operating results furthermore it is difficult to predict how long the economic downturn will continue to what extent it will worsen and to what extent this will continue to affect us 

the reduction in cash flows being experienced by our customers resulting from declines in commodity prices together with the reduced availability of credit and increased costs of borrowing due to the tightening of the credit markets could have significant adverse effects on the financial condition of some of our customers this could result in project modifications delays or cancellations general business disruptions and delay in or nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us which could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows additionally our suppliers could be negatively impacted by current global economic conditions if certain of our suppliers were to experience significant cash flow issues or become insolvent as a result of such conditions it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

the prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of additional factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonunited states operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 80 countries in which we operate 

  

our nonunited states operations accounted for approximately 78 of our consolidated revenue in 2008 76 in 2007 and 73 in 2006 operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 

  

   

  

part 1 item 1a 

  

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries including iran syria sudan and cuba which are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the united states or other governments or organizations 

if any of the risks described above materialize it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

we are also subject to risks related to investment in our common stock in connection with certain us state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries and similar actions by some private investors which could adversely affect the market for our common stock 

  

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 

  

we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials and explosives environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges and waste management we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly expensive complex and stringent these laws may provide for “strict liability” for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations 

  

we could be subject to substantial liability claims which would adversely affect our results and financial condition

executive overview 

  

as 2008 progressed early optimism of continuing growth in oil and natural gas exploration and production activity was dampened by growing evidence of weakening economic conditions that began to significantly weigh upon the energy markets in early october while such weakening did not prevent oil prices from ramping up steeply to 147perbarrel in july the velocity of the subsequent reversal to under 40perbarrel by the end of the year was supported by economic reports and forecasts that confirmed the majority of the oecd organization for economic cooperation and development countries to be in recession by the end of the third quarter consequently global oil demand forecasts for 2008 dropped from quarter to quarter and it became apparent that moderating oil demand growth in the nonoecd economies would no longer be sufficient to offset a continuing threeyear demand decline within the oecd countries as a result 2008 saw the first global oil demand decrease in 25 years in the fourth quarter opec elected to cut production by a total of 37 million barrels per day to remove supply and support prices however the time taken for these cuts to be felt in the market and for the resultant increased spare capacity to be reabsorbed by future growth was large enough for ep customers to cut investment this translated to lower demand and weaker prices for oilfield services in an increasing number of areas late in the fourth quarter 

the natural gas markets presented a similar picture while activity was initially maintained in the first part of the year the developing recession in the latter part of 2008 led to lower industrial demand in the developed economies although commercial and residential demand was maintained in north america supply increased by 6 in 2008 largely as a result of industry deployment of advanced drilling production and completion technologies leading to higher gas production and consequently greater storage levels in spite of lower canadian imports and decreased lng liquified natural gas supplies consequently more lng has become available for other international importers and as a result the majority of the developed economies are well supplied for their needs within the united states the world’s largest natural gas market this translated to reduced gas exploration and production investment with lower demand for oilfield services and consequent pressure on service pricing in a number of areas by the fourth quarter as the market price of natural gas fell in international markets however increasing demand for natural gas in the developing economies led to sustained drilling activity with drilling rigs previously deployed on oil exploration and development moving to natural gas activity in some regions 

within this volatile market schlumberger oilfield services revenue in 2008 grew by 20 versus 2007 with demand strongest in international markets yearonyear growth rates reached 28 in latin america 24 in europecisafrica 18 in middle east  asia and 11 in north america all technologies experienced doubledigit growth most notably in well services drilling  measurements and wireline these results mask however a rapid reversal that occurred late in the year in response to the worsening economic climate and after three quarters of overall growth revenues in the fourth quarter declined sequentially through weakening local currencies and reduced customer spending in addition to seasonal factors 

a variety of new schlumberger products and services contributed to growth in 2008 these included further penetration of scanner family advanced wireline logging services and scope imagingwhiledrilling technologies into new markets as customers sought to increase their understanding of complex reservoirs growth through measurement integration also extended into the production domain with offerings such as the stimmap live realtime fracture monitoring service that combines the measurement capability of wireline with the pressure pumping expertise of well services to track the progress of fracture stimulation in real time 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

to be able to control the operation for maximum effect other new productionrelated services included active coiledtubing services that combine a downhole sensor package with a fiberoptic communications system to monitor coiledtubingenabled operations in real time 

acquisitions in 2008 also served to increase schlumberger capabilities or added specific new technologies to the portfolio in canada schlumberger and first reserve corporation acquired saxon energy services inc a land drilling contractor with major activity in north and south america schlumberger had already enjoyed a long association with saxon including operation of joint ventures in mexico and colombia for the supply of drilling services that support integrated project management activities also in canada schlumberger acquired the business of extreme engineering limited a leading supplier of unmanned measurementwhiledrilling systems to land markets in the united states and canada other technology acquisitions included integrated exploration systems a germanybased technology leader in petroleum systems modeling and staag imaging a houstonbased provider of leadingedge depth imaging technologies for seismic data processing 

the performance of westerngeco where fullyear 2008 revenue fell by 4 versus 2007 was limited by a combination of lower multiclient sales reduced land activity and cost inflation that affected marine operations among these factors multiclient sales were particularly weak with the sharp decrease reported in the first quarter not being reversed later in the year as a clear indication of customers restricting discretionary spending for seismic data contract awards remained strong however and westerngeco reported a record backlog of 18 billion at the end of the year up 700 million from the end of the third quarter 

in spite of this weakerthanexpected performance westerngeco made significant progress in the introduction of new technology during the year these included a new proprietary fullazimuth marine acquisition technique known as coil shooting that leverages the signal fidelity and streamersteering capability of q technology to provide resolution in subsalt applications where wideazimuth techniques mobilize too many resources coil shooting provides the same quality survey but uses only one vessel to do so in other new technology developments the uniq latestgeneration land acquisition system was unveiled this substantially increases the number of acquisition channels available and in combination with proprietary vibrator source technology delivers a sharper image and wider coverage 

the sharp drop in oil and gas prices in the latter part of 2008 that resulted in lower activity higher inventories and the belief that demand will erode further in 2009 as a result of the economic slowdown has led to rapid and substantial reductions in exploration and production expenditure at current prices most of the new categories of hydrocarbon resources such as heavy oil tar sands coaltoliquids or gastoliquids are not economic to develop in addition it will take time for inflation to be removed from the ep supply chain to bring finding and development costs more in line with lower oil and gas prices 

schlumberger therefore expects 2009 activity to weaken across the board with the most significant declines occurring in north american gas drilling russian oil production enhancement and in mature offshore basins exploration offshore will also be somewhat curtailed but commitments already planned are likely to be honored seismic expenditures particularly for multiclient data are likely to decrease from the levels of 2008 furthermore pricing erosion will compound these effects on revenue in this market we are taking the necessary actions early in 2009 to adjust our operating cost base while preserving our longterm commitments to technology development key skill sets and service and product quality 

the most important indicator of a future recovery in oilfield services activity will be a stabilization and recovery in the demand for oil the recent years of increased exploration and production spending however have not been sufficient to substantially improve the supply situation the age of the production base accelerating decline rates and the smaller size of recently developed fields will mean that any prolonged reduction in investment will lead to a strong rebound in activity in the future

fourth quarter 2008 results 

  

fourthquarter revenue of 626 billion was 2 lower sequentially but was 15 higher yearonyear sequentially europecisafrica revenue declined primarily due to a weakening of the local currencies against the us dollar and from lower activity in russia as the result of reduced customer spending and seasonal slowdowns in latin america revenue fell due to weaker local currencies and lower activity in the venezuelatrinidad  tobago and mexicocentral america geomarkets middle east  asia declined on lower activity in the australiapapua new guineanew zealand and qatar geomarkets these decreases however were partially offset by an increase in north america as the result of strong activity in the us gulf of mexico and us land west geomarkets local currency changes reduced oilfield services fourthquarter revenue by approximately 3 

fourthquarter pretax operating income of 160 billion was 6 lower sequentially but 4 higher yearonyear sequentially pretax operating margin decreased from 267 to 256 primarily as a result of reduced activity levels in the europecisafrica latin america and middle east  asia areas partially offset by the improvement in overall activity and a more favorable revenue mix in north america 

  

north america 

  

revenue of 156 billion increased 4 sequentially and 17 yearonyear pretax operating income of 346 million increased 9 sequentially and 2 yearonyear 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

sequentially the us gulf of mexico geomarket activity recovered from the slowdown experienced during the hurricane season of the third quarter and realized further growth on a higher ultra deepwater rig count that led to strong demand for wireline well testing and well services technologies the us land west geomarket revenue increased on strong demand for well services and drilling  measurements services and artificial lift products while the alaska geomarket experienced a seasonal increase in activity that resulted in robust demand for well services and drilling  measurements technologies sis experienced growth from strong yearend software and hardware sales these increases were partially offset by decreased revenue in the us land central and north geomarkets on reducing rig count that accelerated at quarter end canada geomarket revenue was also lower primarily as the result of the weakening of the canadian dollar 

pretax operating margin improved sequentially from 211 to 223 mainly as a result of stronger activity levels and increased highmargin services in the us gulf of mexico us land west and alaska geomarkets these increases were partially offset by pricing pressure in the us land central and north geomarkets 

  

latin america 

  

revenue of 111 billion was 3 lower sequentially but increased 18 yearonyear pretax operating income of 200 million decreased 13 sequentially and 4 yearonyear 

sequentially revenue in the venezuelatrinidad  tobago geomarket declined as a result of lower demand for wireline and well services technologies and completions products while the mexicocentral america geomarket experienced lower activity in integrated project management ipm projects these decreases were partially offset by higher offshore explorationrelated activity in the brazil geomarket that led to robust demand for wireline well testing and drilling  measurements services while activity in the perucolombiaecuador geomarket increased due to strong demand for artificial lift and sis products area revenue was also reduced by approximately 4 due to the weakening of local currencies against the us dollar 

pretax operating margin declined sequentially from 201 to 180 from lower activity and a less favorable revenue mix in the venezuelatrinidad  tobago geomarket reduced gain share from ipm projects in the perucolombiaecuador geomarket and cost inflation and a less favorable revenue mix in the mexicocentral america geomarket 

  

europecisafrica 

  

revenue of 205 billion decreased 5 sequentially but increased 16 yearonyear pretax operating income of 533 million decreased 15 sequentially but was 8 higher yearonyear 

sequentially area revenue was 5 lower due to the weakening of local currencies against the us dollar particularly in the north sea continental europe and russia additionally russia experienced significant reductions in activity from lower customer spending and the seasonal slowdown in sakhalin lower framo revenue also contributed to the decline these decreases were partially offset by significantly increased activity in the libya geomarket from strong demand for artificial lift products and for drilling  measurements well testing and wireline services as well as in the continental europe geomarket from higher demand for wireline and drilling  measurements technologies 

pretax operating margin decreased sequentially from 290 to 261 primarily due to lower activity and a less favorable revenue mix in the north sea and nigeria  gulf of guinea geomarkets and russia the decrease in framo revenue also contributed to this result 

  

middle east  asia 

  

revenue of 147 billion was 2 lower sequentially but 9 higher yearonyear pretax operating income of 491 million decreased 7 sequentially but increased 4 yearonyear 

sequentially area revenue declined mainly as a result of weatherrelated effects in the australiapapua new guineanew zealand and chinajapankorea geomarkets lower activity in qatar a less favorable activity 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

mix in bruneimalaysiaphilippines and reduced customer spending in the chinajapankorea and arabian geomarkets these declines primarily affected demand for wireline drilling  measurements and well services technologies but were partially offset by the positive impact of retroactive price adjustments for a wireline contract in addition to growth in the gulf geomarket for artificial lift products and well services and drilling  measurements technologies 

pretax operating margin declined sequentially from 355 to 335 primarily due to the overall lower level of activity in the area as well as a less favorable revenue mix in the arabian and india geomarkets 

  

total year 2008 results 

  

fullyear 2008 revenue of 2428 billion increased 20 versus 2007 driven by area growth of 28 in latin america 24 in europecisafrica 18 in middle east  asia and 11 in north america 

all technologies experienced doubledigit growth most notably in well services drilling  measurements and wireline 

pretax operating income of 650 billion in 2008 was 9 higher than 2007 however pretax operating margin declined 256 basis points bps to 268 primarily due to reduced pricing for well stimulation services in the us land geomarkets a higher mix of lowmargin thirdparty managed services in the mexicocentral america geomarket and cost inflation across all areas 

  

north america 

  

revenue of 591 billion grew 11 versus 2007 growth was led by the us land west geomarket mostly due to increased gas shale activity that resulted in robust demand for well services and drilling  measurements technologies and by the us land central geomarket on higher rig activity and strong artificial lift product sales the canada geomarket revenue was higher from demand for well services and drilling  measurements technologies while the us gulf of mexico geomarket grew on increased deepwater activity the resulted in strong demand for drilling  measurements and wireline services in addition to completion systems products 

pretax operating margin decreased 557 bps to 232 primarily as the result of lower pricing for well stimulation services in the us land geomarkets and cost inflation across the area 

  

latin america 

  

revenue of 423 billion was 28 higher than 2007 on doubledigit growth across all geomarkets the mexicocentral america geomarket increased on significantly higher ipm activity while the perucolombiaecuador geomarket also experienced increased ipm activity in addition to robust demand for wireline services and for artificial lift and sis products the brazil geomarket grew on higher offshore activity that resulted in stronger demand for well testing wireline and well services technologies the venezuelatrinidad and tobago geomarket experienced increased demand for wireline drilling  measurements and well services activities 

pretax operating margin of 203 declined 262 bps versus 2007 as a result of an increased mix of lowmargin thirdparty managed services in the mexicocentral america geomarket and cost inflation across the area 

  

europecisafrica 

  

revenue of 818 billion increased 24 versus the same period last year growth was led by russia which experienced strong demand for wireline well services and drilling  measurements technologies the west  south africa north sea and caspian geomarkets grew on increased explorationrelated services as well as strong demand for well services technologies the continental europe geomarket was higher due to strong drillingrelated activities and demand for sis products the consolidation of framo also contributed to the increase 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

pretax operating margin decreased 112 bps to 274 primarily as a result of reduced pricing in the libya geomarket and a less favorable revenue mix in the nigeria  gulf of guinea geomarket and russia the consolidation of framo also reduced total area margin 

  

middle east  asia 

  

revenue of 572 billion was 18 higher than the prior year all geomarkets experienced growth most notably in the arabian australiapapua new guineanew zealand gulf and east mediterranean geomarkets among the technologies growth was strongest in wireline drilling  measurements well services and well testing 

pretax operating margin was nearly flat at 350 as the positive impact of the higher overall activity level was offset by cost inflation 

  

total year 2007 results 

  

fullyear 2007 revenue of 2031 billion increased 21 versus 2006 led by area growths of 31 in both the middle east  asia and in europecisafrica and 29 in latin america while north america remained essentially flat pretax operating income of 596 billion in 2007 was 28 higher than 2006 

pretax operating margins of 293 improved 164 bps in 2007 versus 2006 higher activity and expansion of highermargin new technology deployment across europecisafrica middle east  asia and latin america areas were the principal contributors to this performance in north america pricing erosion in pressurepumping wellstimulation activities moderated yearonyear margin growth within the area 

among the geomarkets the greatest increases in revenue were recorded in the north sea followed by mexicocentral america arabian west  south africa and venezuelatrinidad  tobago 

significant demand was seen for all technologies led by drilling  measurements wireline well testing and completions systems as customers continued to improve exploration and production performance in the search for new hydrocarbon reserves and in the need to increase production and boost recovery from existing fields 

  

north america 

  

revenue of 534 billion increased marginally over 2006 primarily due to higher demand for drilling  measurements well testing and wireline activities in the us land central us land north and the us gulf coast geomarkets however this performance was offset by pricing erosion in well stimulation activities across the area 

activity across us land continued to grow driven by the increase in rig count and higher service intensity in unconventional natural gas reservoirs however weakness in natural gas prices and excess well stimulation related pressure pumping capacity led to a yearonyear decline in pricing in stimulation related activities the us gulf coast geomarket continued to grow driven by demand for exploration related activities 

in canada yearonyear revenue declined sharply due to operator slowdown driven by weakness in natural gas prices and uncertainty over the fiscal regime 

pretax operating margin declined by 167 bps to 288 primarily due to lower pricing in well stimulation related activities across the area together with lower activity in canada 

  

latin america 

  

revenue of 330 billion in 2007 increased 29 over 2006 led by a surge in ipmrelated activity in mexico following the budgetrelated slowdowns in the previous year followed by the growth in explorationrelated activities in the perucolumbiaecuador and latin america south geomarkets the venezuelatrinidad  tobago geomarket also grew with higher rig countdriven activity in addition to finalization of the contracts related to drilling barges 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

the mexicocentral america geomarket recorded robust growth with the start of several integrated projects perucolumbiaecuador and latin america south witnessed strong growth in explorationrelated activities demand was strong for all technologies led by ipm followed by drilling  measurements wireline and well testing services 

pretax operating margin increased strongly by 358 bps to reach 229 this increase resulted mainly from a favorable activity mix and improved pricing 

  

europecisafrica 

  

revenue of 660 billion in 2007 increased 31 over 2006 with the highest growth recorded in the north sea west  south africa and north africa geomarkets 

strong revenue increases were recorded in the north sea west  south africa and north africa driven by the expansion of explorationrelated activities geomarkets in russia continued to grow strongly due to a combination of organic growth and the completion of the acquisition of tyumenpromgeofizika during the second quarter of the year 

pretax operating margins increased by 301 bps to reach 286 this performance was due to a combination of increased activity improved pricing and accelerated new technology deployment across most geomarkets partially offset by a pricing decline in well stimulation activities in the east russia and subdued activity in nigeria 

  

middle east  asia 

  

revenue of 487 billion in 2007 increased 31 over 2006 with the largest increases recorded in the arabian geomarket followed by east mediterranean australiapapua new guinea qatar gulf and india 

the australiapapua new guinea geomarket recorded the highest growth rate in the area driven by higher exploration related activity growth in east mediterranean qatar gulf and india resulted from higher exploration and development activity while the arabian geomarket continued to grow albeit at a lower rate than the previous year as new rig additions slowed down in saudi arabia 

pretax operating margin increased by 296 bps to an impressive 351 this performance was driven by continued increase in activity and pricing increases together with deployment of highermargin wireline and drilling  measurements new technologies

fourth quarter 2008 results 

  

fourthquarter revenue of 599 million decreased 33 sequentially and 25 yearonyear pretax operating income of 88 million was 75 lower sequentially and 68 lower yearonyear 

sequentially marine revenue decreased significantly due to seasonal vessel transits dry docks and project startups multiclient revenue was also down markedly as customers reduced discretionary spending land revenue however increased due to higher utilization and the start of new projects in latin america and africa while data processing recorded modest growth 

pretax operating margin decreased sequentially from 398 to 147 due to lower marine vessel utilization higher transits and the slowdown in multiclient sales the effects of which were only partially offset by the higher land crew utilization 

  

total year 2008 results 

  

fullyear 2008 revenue of 284 billion was 4 lower than 2007 multiclient revenue was down 18 primarily as the result of significantly lower client discretionary spending in the fourth quarter of 2008 while land

decreased 15 on lower crew utilization these decreases were partially offset by a 4 revenue increase in marine as a result of additional vessel capacity and higher pricing and a 19 increase in data processing which experienced a growth in activity in all geographic areas 

pretax operating margin of 295 decreased 634 basis points due to significantly lower multiclient sales reduced land activity and cost inflation that affected marine operations 

revenue backlog was 18 billion at the end of 2008 compared to 12 billion at the end of 2007 of which an estimated 13 billion is expected to be realized in 2009 

  

total year 2007 results 

  

fullyear 2007 revenue of 296 billion increased 20 versus 2006 pretax operating income of 106 billion in 2007 was 31 higher than 2006 pretax operating margin reached 358 – an increase of 299 bps in 2007 versus 2006 – demonstrating continued high vessel utilization pricing increases in marine and accelerating demand for explorationdriven seismic services qtechnology revenue reached 114 billion representing 38 of 2007 fullyear revenue 

marine revenue grew 17 due mainly to strong activity in asia middle east india europe and north america as operators continued to focus on new exploration horizons high vessel utilization continued adoption of qtechnology and improved pricing contributed to this performance multiclient revenue increased 30 driven by higher sales in north america as the demand for edog and ecat surveys remained strong during the first half of the year augmented by strong demand for eoctopus surveys during the second half data processing revenue increased 26 reflecting higher acquisition volumes higher levels of q processing and higher activity in india asia north africa europe and the caspian land revenue increased 6 with the continued adoption of qland technology in africa and in the middle east 

during the second quarter of 2007 the seventh qtechnology equipped vessel – the western spirit – was launched 

revenue backlog was 12 billion at the end of 2007 compared to 11 billion at the end of 2006 

  

interest and other income 

  

interest and other income consisted of the following 

  

   

   

interest income 

  

the average return on investments decreased to 35 in 2008 from 52 in 2007 and the weighted average investment balance of 34 billion in 2008 increased 286 million compared to 2007 

the average return on investments increased to 52 in 2007 from 45 in 2006 and the weighted average investment balance of 31 billion in 2007 increased 531 million compared to 2006 

  

equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 

  

the equity in net earnings of affiliated companies primarily represents schlumberger’s share of the results of its 40 interest in the mi swaco drilling fluids joint venture with smith international inc 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense of 247 million in 2008 decreased by 27 million compared to 2007 due to a decline in the weighted average borrowing rates from 50 to 45 the weighted average debt balance of 55 billion in 2008 was essentially flat compared to 2007  

interest expense of 275 million in 2007 increased by 40 million compared to 2006 the weighted average borrowing rates of 50 in 2007 increased from 46 in 2006 the weighted average debt balance of 55 billion in 2007 increased by 420 million compared to 2006 primarily due to the funding in the second quarter of 2006 of the westerngeco transaction described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

other 

  

gross margin was 302 335 and 314 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

the decline in gross margin percentage in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to the following factors reduced pricing for well stimulation services in the us land geomarkets a higher mix of lowmargin thirdparty managed services in the mexicocentral america geomarket significantly lower multiclient sales in westerngeco and the impact of cost inflation across all areas within oilfield services as well as the marine operations of westerngeco 

the increase in gross margin percentage in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to increased pricing stronger demand for highermargin technologies and operating efficiency improvements 

as a percentage of revenue research  engineering marketing and general  administrative expenses were as follows 

  

   

   

research  engineering expenditures by segment were as follows 

  

   

    

income taxes 

  

the effective tax rate was 209 in 2008 219 in 2007 and 240 in 2006 

the schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease conversely when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings oilfield services had a lower proportion of pretax earnings in north america also outside north america various geomarkets with lower tax rates contributed a greater percentage to pretax earnings 

the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings both oilfield services and westerngeco had a lower proportion of pretax earnings in north america outside north america various geomarkets with lower tax rates contributed a greater percentage to pretax earnings 

  

charges and credits 

  

schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits during 2008 2007 and 2006 these charges and credits which are summarized below are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  

the following is a summary of the 2008 charges and credits 

  

   

the following is a summary of the 2007 charges and credits 

  

   

the following is a summary of the 2006 charges and credits 

  

   

cash flow 

  

net debt represents gross debt less cash shortterm investments and fixed income investments held to maturity management believes that net debt provides useful information regarding the level of schlumberger’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt

details of net debt follow 

  

   

   

   

key liquidity events during 2008 2007 and 2006 included 

  

   

   

on april 20 2006 the board of directors of schlumberger approved a share repurchase program of up to 40 million shares of common stock to be acquired in the open market before april 2010 subject to market conditions this program was completed during the second quarter of 2008 

  

on april 17 2008 the board of directors of schlumberger approved an 8 billion share repurchase program for shares of schlumberger common stock to be acquired in the open market before december 31 2011 of which 934 million has been repurchased as of december 31 2008 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

the following table summarizes the activity under these share repurchase programs during 2008 2007 and 2006 

  

   

given the current credit and economic environment schlumberger anticipates that the total dollar amount of stock repurchases in 2009 may be significantly less than the 18 billion spent during 2008 this anticipated reduction will serve to increase schlumberger’s financial flexibility during these uncertain times stock buyback activity during 2009 will continue to be targeted to offset any dilution caused by the schlumberger stockbased compensation programs 

  

   

   

   

   

outside of the us schlumberger’s international staff pension plan which was converted to a defined benefit pension plan during the fourth quarter of 2008 and therefore accounts for approximately half of the increase in the postretirement benefits liability on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2008 and uk pension plan are a combined 69 funded at december 31 2008 based on the projected benefit obligation the uk pension plan was 92 funded at december 31 2007 

  

schlumberger currently anticipates contributing approximately 400 million to 500 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2009 subject to market and business conditions 

  

   

   

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

at december 31 2008 there were no outstanding series a debentures and there were 321 million outstanding series b debentures 

  

   

   

   

as of december 31 2008 schlumberger had approximately 37 billion of cash and shortterm investments on hand whollyowned subsidiaries of schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating 39 billion with commercial banks of which 18 billion was available and unused as of december 31 2008 schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next twelve months 

the current portion of longterm debt at december 31 2008 has increased by 05 billion to 11 billion as compared to december 31 2007 this increase is primarily attributable to the outstanding €400 million guaranteed floating rate notes due 2009 being reclassified from longterm debt at december 21 2008 to current at december 31 2008 due to their maturity in the next twelve months 

schlumberger’s total outstanding debt at december 31 2008 was 53 billion and included approximately 11 billion of commercial paper borrowings the total outstanding debt decreased approximately 02 billion compared to december 31 2007 

  

summary of major contractual obligations 

  

   

    

refer to note 19 of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

as discussed in note 15 of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2008 is approximately 877 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 

schlumberger has outstanding letters of creditguarantees which relate to business performance bonds customexcise tax commitments facility leaserental obligations etc these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain a summary of all of schlumberger’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

multiclient seismic data 

  

the westerngeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 287 million and 182 million respectively such costs are charged to cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value 

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two pools of surveys united states and nonunited states the united states and nonunited states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs certain larger surveys are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis these surveys are typically significantly prefunded by customers and accordingly management has determined that it is not appropriate to include them within the united states and nonunited states pools for impairment review purposes 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value a significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments adjustments to the allowance may be required 

  

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

  

schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of schlumberger’s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by sfas 142 schlumberger’s reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the oilfield services segment in addition to the westerngeco segment schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis andor applying various market multiples determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions schlumberger’s estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units were significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for 2008 2007 and 2006 

longlived assets including fixed assets and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 

  

income taxes 

  

schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the over 100 jurisdictions in which it conducts business these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

pension and postretirement benefits 

  

schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements  the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans 

  

   

   

   

   

a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense 

the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans was 850 in 2008 and 2007 the expected rate of return on plan assets for the international plans was 800 in 2008 and 2007 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in both 2008 and 2007 was 9 graded to 6 over the next four years and 5 thereafter 

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for the united states and international pension plans

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for schlumberger’s united states postretirement medical plans 

  

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger conducts business in approximately 80 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar which is consistent with the oil and gas industry approximately 80 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2008 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will increase 

a 5 change in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in 2008 would have changed revenue by approximately 1 if the 2008 average exchange rates of the us dollar against all foreign currencies had strengthened by 5 schlumberger’s income from continuing operations would have increased by approximately 2 conversely a 5 weakening of the us dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income from continuing operations by approximately 3 

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options to provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on monetary assetsliabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses 

at december 31 2008 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 29 billion in various foreign currencies these contracts mature on various dates in 2009 

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that generally does not involve derivatives and instead primarily uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2008 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 22 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately 31 billion 

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio both shortterm investments and fixed income investments  held to maturity  which totaled approximately 40 billion at december 31 2008 are comprised primarily of money market funds eurodollar time deposits certificates of deposit commercial paper euro notes and eurobonds and are substantially all denominated in us dollars the average return on investment was 35 in 2008 

  

part ii item 7a 

  

  

the following table represents principal amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 2008 by year of maturity 

  

   

the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 24 billion as of december 31 2008 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2008 was approximately 45 

schlumberger does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate derivatives for speculative purposes

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed immediately following item 7a of this report these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this report or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference in this report 

  

we urge you to carefully consider the risks described below as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report if any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report were to materialize our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations 

  

demand for the majority of our oilfield services is substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry a substantial or an extended decline in oil or gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry and reduce our operating revenue 

  

part i item 1a 

  

  

demand for the majority of our oilfield services is substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves which are sensitive to oil and natural gas prices and generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and gas prices oil and gas prices have historically been volatile and are affected by numerous factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns which have been characterized by diminished demand for our oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely impact our operating results 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonunited states operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 80 countries in which we operate 

  

our nonunited states operations accounted for approximately 76 of our consolidated revenue in 2007 73 in 2006 and 75 in 2005 operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries including iran syria sudan and cuba which are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the united states or other governments or organizations 

  

part i item 1a 

  

  

if any of the risks described above materialize it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

we are also subject to risks related to investment in our common stock in connection with certain us state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries and similar actions by some private investors which could adversely affect the market for our common stock 

  

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 

  

we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials and explosives environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges and waste management we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly expensive complex and stringent these laws may provide for “strict liability” for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations 

  

we could be subject to substantial liability claims which would adversely affect our results and financial condition 

  

certain equipment used in the delivery of oilfield services such as directional drilling equipment perforating systems subsea completion equipment radioactive materials and explosives and well completion systems are used in hostile environments such as exploration development and production applications an accident or a failure of a product could cause personal injury loss of life damage to property equipment or the environment and suspension of operations our insurance may not adequately protect us against liability for some kinds of events including events involving pollution or against losses resulting from business interruption moreover in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate substantial claims made under our policies could cause our premiums to increase any future damages caused by our products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

  

if we are unable to maintain technology leadership in the form of services and products this could affect any competitive advantage we hold 

  

if we are unable to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver them to our clients in the form of services and products in a timely and costcompetitive manner in the various markets we serve it could materially reduce our operating revenue and net income 

  

part i item 1a 1b 2 

  

  

limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights including our trade secrets could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold 

  

some of our products or services and the processes we use to produce or provide them have been granted united states patent protection have patent applications pending or are trade secrets our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets 

  

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights 

  

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business royalty payments under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs if a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular product or service which would reduce our operating revenue additionally developing noninfringing technologies would increase our costs 

  

failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations 

  

we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases in periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals this could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations 

  

severe weather conditions may affect our operations 

  

our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate this may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services in addition if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures this may result in a suspension of activities until the platforms or structures have been repaired any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue

executive overview 

  

oil markets exhibited considerable variation in 2007 the opec production cuts of november 2006 that provoked the recovery in the price per barrel entering the winter period in the northern hemisphere were overweighed by mild early winter weather conditions that lead to wti west texas intermediate falling to the year low of 5050perbarrel by midjanuary however price for wti ending the year within striking distance of 100perbarrel market fundamentals supported this upwards trend as evidenced by the need for an opec production increase in september and by the reduction in the days of forward cover of oecd organization for economic cooperation and development oil stocks which had fallen below 53 days by the end of year spare production margins remained narrow driven by geopolitical events and inherent production decline while nonopec production levels continued to be revised downwards as project delays added further uncertainty to performance 

in natural gas markets the weak prices seen at the beginning of 2007 strengthened significantly as colder weather drove demand in north america the region’s gas supply results from four separate components that include domestic production lng liquefied natural gas imports canadian exports to the us and us exports to mexico changes in any of these affect overall supply and during the year higher production and higher imports particularly of lng led to aboveaverage levels of naturalgas storage in the us with consequent weaker commodity pricing later in the year 

maintaining the production base for both oil and natural gas continues to face challenges in both cases the aging of reservoirs that have been in production for many decades gives rise to increasing production decline rates that require constant stemming while weak reserves replacement ratios and heightened resource nationalism dictate that exploration for new hydrocarbon deposits—in increasingly more remote areas and complex geologies—must increase 

within this context schlumberger revenue in 2007 grew by 21 driven by strong demand for oilfield services particularly overseas yearonyear growth rates reached 31 in middle east  asia 30 in europecisafrica and 29 in latin america in north america however revenue was essentially flat relative to 2006 all oilfield services technologies showed doubledigit improvement with drilling  measurements well testing and integrated project management recording the highest overall growth rates yearonyear 

the business pattern that emerged in 2007—with significant differences in growth inside and outside north america—marked a change in the oil and gas industry growth cycle there were two reasons for this north american activity is largely driven by natural gas exploration and production and the number of active drilling rigs proved sufficient to maintain satisfactory levels of production—at least in the short term in addition the strong international growth was mainly directed to oil and primarily landbased as the available offshore rig fleet reached full utilization—particularly in deep water 

new schlumberger products and services contributed to growth in 2007 in line with the need for improved well performance for example particularly through stimulation of natural gas wells schlumberger introduced the contact family of staged fracturing and completion services early in the year these services penetrated a number of key markets with a broad range of efficient and effective stimulation technologies in north america contact services demonstrated their ability to place fracture treatments more accurately while stimulating multiple productive sands in a single operation to increase production and lower cost contact technologies were also demonstrated and deployed in gabon kuwait and saudi arabia with significant production improvements in every case 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

within this landscape schlumberger made further progress in areas where competitive advantage exists in technology and business model in russia schlumberger further expanded operations through the acquisition of tyumenpromgeofizika a west siberian wireline logging company elsewhere in siberia manufacturing activities increased as wireline and well services began assembly of perforating and pumping equipment in tyumen research and engineering activity accelerated with the opening of the new moscow research center and the extension of the engineering center in novosibirsk and to address the needs of the increased staff in russia the siberian training center partially opened for a number of training courses at the end of the year with full operation expected early in 2008 

russia also benefited from expanding takeup of integrated project management services in siberia similar operations began in other geomarket regions in europecisafrica and there was further strong growth in the well construction businesses in latin america where a new phase of deeper hotter and more complex operations started in mexico these events are consistent with our goal of growing project management services at a much higher rate than the rest of the business 

growth at westerngeco where fullyear 2007 revenue increased by 20 over 2006 matched the overall trend set by oilfield services this was driven by demand for marine seismic and multiclient data sales while qtechnology revenue increased again to a new high of 114 billion up 57 versus 2006 vessel utilization for the year reached 93 with half of the marine fleet now equipped with qtechnology systems the strength of the seismic market particularly in marine services led us to review our longterm plans for the fleet resulting in the acquisition of eastern echo in november the six new highperformance highcapacity vessels on order are ideally suited to the exploration and development markets of the future and all six will be fitted with qtechnology equipment 

in addition to the acquisitions of tyumenpromgeofizika and eastern echo technologybased growth was furthered through a number of smaller acquisitions made during the year these included insensys oil  gas fiberoptic technology for the expanding subsea market vips reservoir software and interpretation expertise to accelerate schlumberger strength in geomechanics innerlogix information management technology for data quality improvement and geosystem electromagnetic technology to expand westerngeco electromagnetics solutions the technology portfolio was also boosted by the acquisition of a further 55 share in framo engineering as to take the schlumberger holding to a majority 5275 framo is a norwegianbased company providing multiphase booster pumps flow metering equipment and swivel stack systems we will begin consolidating the results of framo in the first quarter of 2008 

in early 2007 we reiterated our view that while schlumberger would continue to see high growth through the end of the present decade growth rates would ultimately slow from the breakneck pace of the earlier part of 2006 strong growth was indeed seen in 2007 but the shorterterm outlook for 2008 has become more complex with several factors set to influence the business in the coming year on the positive side growth in land activity outside north america will remain strong and seismic exploration services worldwide will remain in high demand on land and offshore as the industry gears up for an expanded exploration phase however in north america we do not expect levels of natural gas drilling to vary greatly in the absence of severe winter weather overall growth will also be restricted by the high utilization of the existing offshore rig fleet and the fact that only limited new builds will enter the market over the next 12 months this will make activity vulnerable to operating efficiency 

maintaining and increasing the production base for both oil and natural gas will continue to be challenging the aging of reservoirs that have been in production for many decades requires high levels of activity in order to stem decline while weak reserves replacement ratios and heightened resource nationalism dictate that exploration for new hydrocarbon deposits—in ever more remote areas and complex geologies—must increase 

in the longer term current levels of drilling are insufficient to meaningfully slow decline rates improve reservoir recovery or add sufficient new production capacity the explosion in exploration licenses awarded in the last three years the continual expansion of the number of new offshore rigs being ordered for delivery

through and beyond the end of the decade and the industrywide as well as our own plans to increase both capital expenditure and research and development spending are clear indicators of future growth

fourth quarter 2007 results 

  

fourthquarter revenue of 544 billion was 6 higher sequentially and 18 higher as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 sequential revenue increases were highest in the middle east  asia area led by the arabian chinajapankorea and india geomarkets followed by the latin america area where growth was strongest in the mexicocentral america latin america south and perucolombiaecuador geomarkets in the europecisafrica area increases were led by the north sea caspian and continental europe geomarkets growth was also recorded in north america led primarily by the canada and us gulf coast geomarkets among schlumberger technologies artificial lift systems completions systems and schlumberger information solutions sis registered strong growth due to seasonal endofyear product sales 

fourthquarter pretax operating income of 154 billion increased 2 sequentially and 16 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 sequentially growth was driven by demand for highermargin drilling  measurements services in the middle east  asia area and by increased product sales in artificial lift systems in europecisafrica and middle east  asia and by completions systems product sales in the middle east  asia and latin america however these increases were offset by pricing erosion for well stimulation related activities on land in the us exceptional weatherrelated and operational delays in mexicocentral america and weather and seasonal effects in the us west north sea and east russia geomarkets these events resulted in an overall pretax operating margin in the fourth quarter of 282 as compared to 294 in the third quarter of 2007 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

north america 

  

revenue of 133 billion increased 3 sequentially but decreased 7 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 pretax operating income of 338 million decreased 3 sequentially and 23 yearonyear 

sequentially revenue in the canada geomarket continued to grow led by demand for well services and wireline technologies in the us gulf coast geomarket activity partially recovered from the slowdown experienced during the hurricane season of the third quarter with higher demand for wireline well testing and well services technologies in addition higher sis product sales were recorded across the area this performance was largely offset by the continuing pricing erosion in well stimulation related activities in the us land geomarkets seasonal land access constraints in the west and by lower activity in alaska 

pretax operating margin for the area declined sequentially from 269 to 254 due to the lower pricing environment for well stimulation related services in the us land and canada geomarkets as well as lower operating leverage in alaska and canada this was partially offset by a more favorable activity mix and higher operating efficiency in the us gulf coast geomarket together with the areawide sis product sales 

  

latin america 

  

revenue of 943 million increased 9 sequentially and 40 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 pretax operating income of 208 million increased 2 sequentially and 47 yearonyear 

sequential revenue growth was recorded in all geomarkets primarily driven by ipm activities in mexicocentral america perucolombiaecuador and venezuelatrinidad  tobago increased demand for well testing technologies and higher sales of artificial lift systems completions systems and sis products in latin america south together with higher sales of artificial lift systems and completions systems products in the mexicocentral america and perucolombiaecuador geomarkets also contributed to growth 

pretax operating margin declined sequentially from 237 to 221 primarily due to the activity mix in the mexicocentral america geomarket which was affected by higher ipm project startup and thirdparty costs as well as by flooding in the south and operational delays offshore these startup costs are expected to continue for the next few quarters a lower mix of highermargin drilling  measurements activity in venezuelatrinidad  tobago and highermargin wireline technology in perucolombiaecuador also contributed to this result 

  

europecisafrica 

  

revenue of 177 billion increased 4 sequentially and 23 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 pretax operating income of 493 million was flat sequentially but increased 28 yearonyear 

sequentially the north sea geomarket recorded the highest revenue growth driven by increased demand for wireline and well services technologies together with higher artificial lift systems and sis product sales higher demand for drilling  measurements technologies in the caspian geomarket increased artificial lift systems product sales in north russia and high demand for drilling  measurements well services and well testing technologies in continental europe also contributed to growth this performance was partially offset by the seasonal slowdown in sakhalin and subdued activity in nigeria 

pretax operating margin declined sequentially from 292 to 279 due to the seasonal slowdown in sakhalin and to weatherrelated delays which led to reduced demand for higher margin drilling  measurements and well testing technologies in the north sea a less favorable activity mix in the west  south africa and north africa geomarkets also contributed to this result 

  

middle east  asia 

  

revenue of 135 billion increased 10 sequentially and 30 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 pretax operating income of 473 million increased 8 sequentially and 40 yearonyear 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

the sequential growth in revenue resulted from high demand for drilling  measurements and wireline technologies together with higher completions systems artificial lift systems and sis product sales in the arabian geomarket higher demand for explorationrelated drilling  measurements technologies and for artificial lift systems products in qatar increased demand for drilling  measurements and well testing services in chinajapankorea and higher deepwater explorationdriven demand for wireline and drilling  measurements technologies together with higher sis product sales in india 

the pretax operating margin of 350 as compared to 357 in the third quarter resulted from the more favorable activity mix in the arabian and india geomarkets being offset by reduced demand for highermargin wireline well services and well testing technologies in the indonesia thailandvietnam and australiapapua new guinea geomarkets

fullyear 2007 revenue of 2031 billion increased 21 versus 2006 led by area growth of 31 in the middle east  asia followed by 30 in europecisafrica and 29 in latin america while north america remained essentially flat pretax operating income of 596 billion in 2007 was 28 higher than 2006 

pretax operating margins of 293 improved 164 basis points bps in 2007 versus 2006 higher activity and expansion of highermargin new technology deployment across europecisafrica middle east  asia and latin america areas were the principal contributors to this performance in north america pricing erosion in pressurepumping wellstimulation activities moderated yearonyear margin growth within the area 

among the geomarkets the greatest increases in revenue were recorded in the north sea followed by mexico west  south africa arabian and venezuelatrinidad  tobago geomarkets 

significant demand was seen for all technologies led by drilling  measurements wireline well testing and completions systems as customers continued to improve exploration and production performance in the search for new hydrocarbon reserves and in the need to increase production and boost recovery from existing fields 

to adapt the existing schlumberger geomarket structure to expanding activity levels worldwide qatar was established as a separate geomarket and new geomarkets were established in russia and on land in the us bringing the total number of geomarkets to 31 

  

north america 

  

revenue of 534 billion increased marginally over 2006 primarily due to higher demand for drilling  measurements well testing and wireline activities in the us land central us land north and the us gulf coast geomarkets however this performance was offset by pricing erosion in well stimulation activities across the area 

activity across us land continued to grow driven by the increase in rig count and higher service intensity in unconventional natural gas reservoirs however weakness in natural gas prices and excess well stimulationrelated pressure pumping capacity led to a yearonyear decline in pricing in stimulation related activities the us gulf coast geomarket continued to grow driven by demand for exploration related activities 

in canada yearonyear revenue declined sharply due to operator slowdown driven by weakness in natural gas prices and uncertainty over the fiscal regime 

pretax operating margin declined by 167 bps to 288 primarily due to lower pricing in well stimulation related activities across the area together with lower activity in canada

among the geomarkets the greatest increases in revenue were recorded in us land followed by the arabian russian north sea us gulf coast canada west  south africa nigeria and north africa geomarkets the growth in russia was driven by a combination of activity within the established geomarkets and the impact of the acquisition of petroalliance services 

significant demand was seen for all technologies as customers sought to improve exploration and production performance while mitigating technical risk in the search for new hydrocarbon reserves and in the need to increase production and boost recovery from existing fields 

a number of key acquisitions were made during the year these included the acquisition of the outstanding 49 of petroalliance services in russia as well as terratek – a global leader in geomechanics measurements and analysis odegaard – a leader in advanced surface seismic data inversion software and reslink – a leading supplier of advanced completion solutions which offer a broad spectrum of engineering applications and products for sand management zonal isolation and intelligent well completions 

  

north america 

  

revenue of 527 billion increased 40 over 2005 mainly driven by the us land and us gulf coast geomarkets which benefited from strong well services drilling  measurements and wireline activities coupled with continued pricing improvements increasing demand for well testing activities offshore also contributed to growth 

sharply increased activity in the us land geomarket led to strong equipment and personnel utilization higher pricing and increased demand for hightier newtechnology services the us gulf coast geomarket rebounded strongly from the effects of the disastrous 2005 hurricane season with growth driven by a combination of new exploration and increased productionrelated activities 

canada continued to grow due to strong demand for drilling  measurements and wireline technologies growth was somewhat offset by lower well services activity in the coal bed methane and shallow gas areas in the second half of the year 

pretax operating income of 160 billion was 72 higher than in 2005 led by the us land and us gulf of mexico geomarkets the steep growth was primarily due to continuing strength in pricing particularly for well services wireline and drilling  measurements technologies and a more favorable activity mix resulting from the deployment of highermargin newtechnology drilling  measurements wireline and well testing services 

  

latin america 

  

revenue of 256 billion in 2006 increased 16 over 2005 led by the venezuelatrinidad  tobago geomarket followed by the latin america south and perucolombiaecuador geomarkets growth in the area was impacted by budgetrelated activity slowdowns in mexico together with geopolitical concerns in other parts of the region 

the venezuelatrinidad  tobago geomarket recorded strong growth due to solid demand for drilling  measurements technologies well services wireline completions and artificial lift technologies also contributed to growth in venezuela discussions regarding new contracts for the drilling barges work and the settlement of certain outstanding receivables had progressed at the end of the year pending finalization of these new contracts revenue recognition was deferred on certain work performed in the third and fourth quarters as the costs associated with this work were also deferred this did not have a significant impact on the area’s pretax operating income 

the latin america south geomarket registered strong growth due primarily to increased well services drilling  measurements ipm and well testing activities while growth in the perucolombiaecuador geomarket resulted from significant demand for drilling  measurements wireline and artificial lift technologies

other 

  

gross margin was 335 314 and 257 in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increases in gross margins are primarily due to record activity levels in 2007 and 2006 increased pricing stronger demand for highermargin technologies and operating efficiency improvements 

as a percentage of revenue research  engineering marketing and general  administrative expenses are as follows 

  

   

   

research  engineering expenditures by segment were as follows 

  

   

    

income taxes 

  

the reported effective tax rate including charges and credits  was 219 in 2007 240 in 2006 and 229 in 2005 the charges and credits noted below decreased the effective rate by 15 in 2005 the impact of charges and credits on the effective tax rate in 2007 and 2006 was not significant 

the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings both oilfield services and westerngeco had a lower proportion of pretax earnings in north america outside north america various geomarkets with lower tax rates contributed a greater percentage to pretax earnings 

the effective tax rate in 2005 reflects the impact of the 163 million gain on the sale of the montrouge facility this transaction allowed for the utilization of a deferred tax asset that was previously offset by a valuation allowance and had the effect of lowering the effective tax rate during 2005 by 13 excluding the impact of this transaction the effective tax rate was relatively flat in 2006 as compared to 2005

stockbased compensation and other 

  

stockbased compensation expense was 136 million in 2007 compared to 114 million in 2006 and 40 million in 2005 

the 22 million increase in stockbased compensation expense in 2007 as compared to 2006 was attributable to i the fact that schlumberger began granting restricted stock in 2006 to a targeted population of employees in order to promote retention and the fair value of the restricted stock is expensed over the vesting period which is generally three years and ii the impact of increased valuations of stockbased compensation awards due to the upward movement in schlumberger’s stock price as compared to prior years 

the 74 million increase in stockbased compensation expense in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to i the impact of schlumberger’s adoption of fas 123r and fas 123 as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements  ii valuations of stockbased compensation awards increasing due to the upward movement in schlumberger’s stock price as compared to prior years and iii the impact of the implementation of the restricted stock program in 2006 

stockbased compensation expense is currently estimated to be approximately 180 million in 2008 this represents an increase of 44 million as compared to 2007 and will be primarily attributable to increased valuations of stockbased compensation awards due to schlumberger’s higher stock price in recent years as compared to prior years as well as the continued effect of the restricted stock program 

during 2006 schlumberger relocated its united states corporate office from new york to houston and its united states research center from ridgefield to boston schlumberger incurred approximately 30 million of incremental expenses in connection with these moves in 2006 the vast majority of these costs were incurred in the third and fourth quarters of 2006 10 million in the third quarter 15 million in the fourth quarter

summary of major contractual commitments 

  

   

    

refer to note 19 of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

as discussed in note 15 of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2007 is approximately 858 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 

schlumberger has outstanding letters of creditguarantees which relate to business performance bonds customexcise tax commitments facility leaserental obligations etc these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain a summary of all of schlumberger’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

multiclient seismic data 

  

the westerngeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 was 182 million 227 million and 222 million respectively such costs are charged to cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however except as described below under “ westerngeco purchase accounting ” under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library future cash flows are analyzed based on two pools of surveys united states and nonunited states the united states and nonunited states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 

  

westerngeco purchase accounting 

  

as described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements  on april 28 2006 schlumberger acquired the remaining 30 minority interest in westerngeco from baker hughes incorporated for 24 billion in cash as a result of this transaction schlumberger attained 100 ownership of westerngeco 

during the process of allocating the purchase price to the proportionate share of net assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values schlumberger made certain significant estimates and assumptions relating to the accounting for westerngeco’s vessels and multiclient seismic data 

in analyzing the fair value of the westerngeco vessels it was determined that the remaining estimated useful lives of these assets exceeded the remaining estimated life currently being used to calculate depreciation expense therefore the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels were extended an additional 4 years on a weighted average basis as of the date of the acquisition the impact of the fair value adjustments for all fixed assets combined with the change in estimate regarding the depreciable lives of the vessels resulted in a net reduction in depreciation expense of approximately 2 million in 2006 

the carrying value of the multiclient library immediately after the acquisition increased to 243 million from 202 million reflecting the impact of a 41 million fair value adjustment these capitalized costs are being charged to cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs on the balance sheet to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data schlumberger’s policy has been that under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value after consideration of the estimated number of future years that revenues are expected to be derived from the multiclient seismic data at the time of the acquisition schlumberger concluded that the remaining minimum amortization period should be 3 years for all surveys in the multiclient seismic library at the time of the transaction effectively resetting the minimum amortization period therefore the 243 million of capitalized multiclient seismic data costs will be charged to expense over a period no longer than the next 3 years from the date of the transaction surveys comprising the 202 million of multiclient seismic data costs prior to this transaction had a weighted average remaining life for purposes of computing the minimum amortization of approximately 18 years given the current emphasis on requiring multiclient projects to be significantly prefunded before a project commences schlumberger currently estimates that the majority of revenues to be derived from sales of new surveys will be achieved within a 4year period therefore schlumberger will continue its policy that under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value for all surveys added to the library after the date of this transaction 

the net impact of the 41 million fair value adjustment combined with the resetting of the minimum amortization period resulted in an approximate 28 million net reduction in multiclient amortization expense in 2006 as compared to what multiclient amortization expense would have been had this transaction not been consummated 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value a significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices customer satisfaction claims and pricing discrepancies depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments adjustments to the allowance may be required 

  

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

  

schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of schlumberger’s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by sfas 142 schlumberger’s reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the oilfield services segment in addition to the westerngeco segment schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis andor applying various market multiples from time to time a thirdparty valuation expert may assist in the determination of fair value determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions schlumberger’s estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units were significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for 2007 2006 and 2005 

longlived assets including fixed assets and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management in order to estimate the fair value of a longlived asset schlumberger may engage a thirdparty to assist with the valuation if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

income taxes 

  

schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the over 100 jurisdictions in which it conducts business these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

  

pension and postretirement benefits 

  

schlumberger’s pension benefit and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations the discount rate utilized to determine both the liability for schlumberger’s united states pension plans and for schlumberger’s united states postretirement medical plans was increased from 600 at december 31 2006 to 650 at december 31 2007 the discount rate utilized to determine expense for schlumberger’s united states pension plans and postretirement medical plans was increased from 575 in 2006 to 600 in 2007 the change in the discount rate was made to reflect market interest rate conditions a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense 

the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the expected rate of return on plan assets was 850 in 2007 and 2006 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in both 2007 and 2006 was 9 graded to 6 over the next four years and 5 thereafter 

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for the united states pension plans

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

schlumberger is subject to market risk primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger conducts its business in approximately 80 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar which is consistent with the oil and gas industry approximately 83 of schlumberger’s revenue in 2007 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will increase 

a 5 change in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in 2007 would have changed revenue by approximately 1 if the 2007 average exchange rates of the us dollar against all foreign currencies had strengthened by 5 schlumberger’s income from continuing operations would have increased by 3 conversely a 5 weakening of the us dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income from continuing operations by 3 

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates foreign currency forward contracts provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on assetsliabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses 

at december 31 2007 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 26 billion in various foreign currencies these contracts mature on various dates in 2008 

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixedrate debt together with interest rate swaps where appropriate to fix or lower borrowing costs 

at december 31 2007 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 26 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately 29 billion 

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also somewhat mitigated by its investment portfolio both shortterm investments and fixed income investments held to maturity  which totaled approximately 34 billion at december 31 2007 are comprised primarily of eurodollar time deposits certificates of deposit and commercial paper euronotes and eurobonds and are substantially all denominated in us dollars the average return on investment was 52 in 2007 

  

part ii item 7a 

  

  

the following table represents principal amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 2007 by year of maturity 

  

   

the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 39 billion as of december 31 2007 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2007 was approximately 53 

on december 31 2007 interest rate swap arrangements outstanding were pay floatingreceive fixed on us dollar debt of 40 million these arrangements mature at various dates to december 2009 interest rate swap arrangements decreased consolidated interest expense in 2007 by 04 million 

schlumberger does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate derivatives for speculative purposes

 item 1a risk factors 

  

we urge you to carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this report if any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report were to occur our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations 

  

demand for the majority of our oilfield services is substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry a substantial or an extended decline in oil or gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry and reduce our operating revenue 

  

demand for the majority of our oilfield services is substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves which are sensitive to oil and natural gas prices and generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and gas prices oil and gas prices have historically been volatile and are affected by numerous factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns which have been characterized by diminished demand for our oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely impact our operating results 

  

part i item 1a 

  

  

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonunited states operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the approximately 80 countries in which we operate 

  

our nonunited states operations accounted for approximately 72 of our consolidated revenue in 2006 75 in 2005 and 74 in 2004 operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries including iran syria sudan and cuba which are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the united states or other governments or organizations 

the occurrence of any of the risks described above could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

  

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations 

  

we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials radioactive materials and explosives environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges and waste management we incur and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly expensive complex and stringent these laws may provide for “strict liability” for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety strict liability can render a party liable for damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes accordingly we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to or releases of hazardous substances in addition stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations 

  

part i item 1a 

  

  

we could be subject to substantial liability claims which would adversely affect our results and financial condition 

  

certain equipment used in the delivery of oilfield services such as directional drilling equipment perforating systems subsea completion equipment radioactive materials and explosives and well completion systems are used in hostile environments such as exploration development and production applications an accident or a failure of a product can cause personal injury loss of life damage to property equipment or the environment and suspension of operations our insurance may not adequately protect us against liability for some kinds of events including events involving pollution or against losses resulting from business interruption moreover in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate substantial claims made under our policies could cause our premiums to increase any future damages caused by our products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

  

our ability to maintain technology leadership in the form of services and products could affect any competitive advantage we hold 

  

if we are unable to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver them to our clients in the form of services and products in a timely and costcompetitive manner in the various markets we serve it could materially reduce our operating revenue and net income 

  

limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights including our trade secrets could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold 

  

some of our products or services and the processes we use to produce or provide them have been granted united states patent protection have patent applications pending or are trade secrets our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology our patent applications are denied or our trade secrets are not adequately protected our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets 

  

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights 

  

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business royalty payments under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs if a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular product or service which would reduce our operating revenue additionally developing noninfringing technologies would increase our costs 

  

failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations 

  

we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases in periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals this could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations 

  

severe weather conditions may affect our operations 

  

our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in certain areas where we operate this may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services in addition if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures this may result in a suspension of activities until the platforms or structures have been repaired any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue

executive overview 

  

world oil markets remained tightly balanced for much of 2006 as demand geopolitical events and inherent production decline continued to pressure the margin of excess production capacity the price for wti west texas intermediate reached a record of 78perbarrel in midjuly but then began a fall that continued through the end of year as increasing stockpiles indicated adequate supply although prices recovered as opec cut production targets from november 1 st  mild weather conditions in the northern hemisphere further exacerbated the balance of supply and demand and prices ended the year around the 55perbarrel mark however at this level there were no signs of reductions in customer activity in any of the major oilproducing regions around the world 

natural gas displayed similar characteristics with the price falling considerably in the fourth quarter of 2006 as the high quantity in storage in north america appeared more than ample for what had begun as a predominantly mild winter by the end of 2006 this demand environment had lead to activity reduction in canada particularly in areas of shallow natural gas and coalbed methane production 

shortterm variations in commodity prices inevitably produce varying activity growth rates in the underlying industries when the price variations are sufficiently longlasting however maintaining the production base for both oil and natural gas in the face of accelerating decline rates poorer quality or more difficult reservoirs and eroding reserve replacement ratios we believe will mean that any moderation in customer activity resulting from price variation will be shortlived and selfcorrecting while schlumberger remains of the opinion that there is no overall shortage of oil and gas reserves worldwide we believe the world is realizing that the period of cheap hydrocarbon energy has ended and new and higher sustained levels of investment are necessary to meet demand and guarantee future supplies 

within this context the performance of the two schlumberger business segments oilfield services and westerngeco has been particularly strong consolidated revenues in 2006 grew by 34 far exceeding original expectations – driven by significant price increases a rich portfolio of new schlumberger technologies and by stronger activity in almost all geomarkets the same combination led to significant margin growth for both schlumberger business segments with westerngeco growth during the year being particularly impressive as exploration activity resurged 

the last two years have seen a significant shift in the dynamics of access to reserves this has been the case in latin america and in russia and is also the case in the middle east in addition and in a way not seen since the 1973 oil shocks access to reserves has become an issue of national energy security particularly for the growing economies of asia as a result many national oil companies have begun to expand beyond their geographic borders and are therefore competing for access to reserves against the international industry the same lack of access has driven the international oil companies to smaller more complex and more remote areas where substantial investment is required 

the period from 2000 to 2004 reflected a lack of explorationrelated activity as a whole this can now clearly be seen as changing and we believe that industry spending will increase for a number of years to come regions that are emerging include many areas in west and south africa nigeria algeria libya saudi arabia qatar india and china and the geomarkets that cover these regions all contributed to schlumberger growth in 2006 however what is perhaps equally significant is the increase in exploration within known fields this is driven by the need to identify and access bypassed or small accumulations of oil that can be tied back to existing infrastructure the north sea parts of saudi arabia and russia are examples of this

in russia and more particularly in west siberia the production enhancement activity that restored production in the 19982003 timeframe is now becoming a business focused on developing the remaining pockets of recoverable oil within producing reservoirs at the same time continuing exploration activity offshore sakhalin and burgeoning exploration in eastern siberia are contributing to rapid growth growth has been fueled both by organic expansion and by the acquisition of petroalliance services which was completed in may 2006 to supply the russian market we have continued to increase our incountry product development and manufacturing with installations in tyumen and novosibirsk in western siberia 

the resurgence in exploration activity has led to substantial technologybased growth for schlumberger westerngeco as well as oilfield services’ wireline drilling  measurements and well testing services have all benefited from this as they are services that impact reservoir characterization and understanding growth however has been accelerated by a number of critical acquisitions in addition to the last tranche of petroalliance services in russia schlumberger purchased the 30 minority interest in westerngeco in the second quarter of 2006 this acquisition has removed the barriers to integration of a number of different measurement techniques that was not possible in a joint venture with a competitor but perhaps even more significantly schlumberger made other acquisitions to extend its technology portfolio odegaard inversion software terratek geomechanical expertise and reslink advanced completions solutions were three such examples in 2006 

integrated project management has been a further avenue for growth that has responded to an emerging customer need in markets where the lack of skilled resources and the increase in international operations have posed challenges for a variety of industry operators in 2005 and 2006 schlumberger has focused on this market opportunity that responds to the need to increase production and reserves clear focus on bringing field and production management services as well as well construction services have had positive effects on returns and 2006 profitability has shown a marked improvement over prior years 

the following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements

among the geomarkets the greatest increases in revenue were recorded in us land followed by the arabian russian north sea us gulf coast canada west  south africa nigeria and north africa geomarkets the growth in russia was driven by a combination of activity within the established geomarkets and the impact of the acquisition of petroalliance services 

significant demand was seen for all technologies as customers sought to improve exploration and production performance while mitigating technical risk in the search for new hydrocarbon reserves and in the need to increase production and boost recovery from existing fields 

a number of key acquisitions were made during the year these included the acquisition of the outstanding 49 of petroalliance services in russia as well as terratek – a global leader in geomechanics measurements and analysis odegaard – a leader in advanced surface seismic data inversion software and reslink – a leading supplier of advanced completion solutions which offer a broad spectrum of engineering applications and products for sand management zonal isolation and intelligent well completions 

  

north america 

  

revenue of 527 billion increased 40 over 2005 mainly driven by the us land and us gulf coast geomarkets which benefited from strong well services drilling  measurements and wireline activities coupled with continued pricing improvements increasing demand for well testing activities offshore also contributed to growth 

sharply increased activity in the us land geomarket led to strong equipment and personnel utilization higher pricing and increased demand for hightier newtechnology services the us gulf coast geomarket rebounded strongly from the effects of the disastrous 2005 hurricane season with growth driven by a combination of new exploration and increased productionrelated activities 

canada continued to grow due to strong demand for drilling  measurements and wireline technologies growth was somewhat offset by lower well services activity in the coal bed methane and shallow gas areas in the second half of the year 

pretax operating income of 160 billion was 72 higher than in 2005 led by the us land and us gulf of mexico geomarkets the steep growth was primarily due to continuing strength in pricing particularly for well services wireline and drilling  measurements technologies and a more favorable activity mix resulting from the deployment of highermargin newtechnology drilling  measurements wireline and well testing services 

  

latin america 

  

revenue of 256 billion in 2006 increased 16 over 2005 led by the venezuelatrinidad  tobago geomarket followed by the latin america south and perucolombiaecuador geomarkets growth in the area was impacted by budgetrelated activity slowdowns in mexico together with geopolitical concerns in other parts of the region 

the venezuelatrinidad  tobago geomarket recorded strong growth due to solid demand for drilling  measurements technologies well services wireline completions and artificial lift technologies also contributed to growth in venezuela discussions regarding new contracts for the drilling barges work and the settlement of certain outstanding receivables had progressed at the end of the year pending finalization of these new contracts revenue recognition was deferred on certain work performed in the third and fourth quarters as the costs associated with this work were also deferred this did not have a significant impact on the area’s pretax operating income 

the latin america south geomarket registered strong growth due primarily to increased well services drilling  measurements ipm and well testing activities while growth in the perucolombiaecuador geomarket resulted from significant demand for drilling  measurements wireline and artificial lift technologies 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

pretax operating income of 495 million in 2006 increased 50 versus 2005 this increase resulted mainly from a favorable activity mix in ipm projects and improved operating efficiencies in drilling  measurements and well testing services 

  

europecisafrica 

  

revenue of 482 billion in 2006 increased 36 over 2005 with the highest growth recorded in the north sea north africa nigeria geomarkets and in russia 

strong revenue increases were recorded in russia and other cis countries despite the weatherrelated slowdown in the first quarter due to a combination of organic growth within schlumberger technology lines and the impact of the acquisition of petroalliance services renewed customer focus on exploration resulted in steep growth in the north sea and north africa geomarkets while the west  south africa and nigeria geomarkets maintained a robust growth momentum 

pretax operating income of 120 billion in 2006 increased 70 compared to 2005 all geomarkets contributed significantly through increased activity improved pricing and accelerated new technology deployment 

  

middle east  asia 

  

revenue of 396 billion in 2006 increased 31 over 2005 with the largest increases recorded in the arabian east africa  east mediterranean and gulf geomarkets 

saudi arabia continued aggressive growth rates as activity increased rapidly distinguishing the arabian geomarket as the fastest growing of all of the geomarkets 

growth in the east africa  east mediterranean and gulf geomarkets was principally attributed to higher activity in drilling  measurements and wireline services the bruneimalaysiaphilippines australia papua new guinea and thailandvietnammyanmar geomarkets also contributed to growth 

all technologies witnessed solid growth as activity increased and demand for new technology increased with significant progress in the deployment of drilling  measurements powerdrive and scope technologies to enable successful drilling of a number of complex borehole trajectories 

pretax operating income of 129 billion in 2006 increased 48 compared to 2005 the steady increase in operating income and operating margins throughout the year was due to activity improvement across all geomarkets significant price increases and accelerated new technology deployment

2006 results 

  

operating revenue of 247 billion increased 49 in 2006 versus 2005 this strong performance was due to the continued market acceptance of qtechnology services and strong performance from marine land data processing and multiclient services during the second quarter schlumberger acquired the baker hughes 30 interest in westerngeco 

revenue backlog reached 11 billion at the end of 2006 compared to 790 million at the end of last year reflecting increasing exploration and production activity 

qtechnology revenues reached 726 million in 2006 representing 29 of total revenue in 2006 significantly in excess of the 399 million achieved in 2005 utilization of the six qequipped vessels reached 100 in the fourth quarter of 2006 

multiclient sales increased 51 to 770 million mainly in the us gulf of mexico due to strong sales of the world’s largest and most complex depth migration project – known as edog – which covers an area of 20250 sq km and extends over 800 blocks in the deepwater gulf of mexico also contributing to the strong increase were higher sales in latin america asia and west africa – reflecting the strengthening exploration activity 

marine revenue grew 65 due mainly to strong activity in asia middle east india europe and north america higher vessel utilization accelerated adoption of qtechnology and increasing prices contributed to this performance

revenue of 1265 billion increased 24 in 2005 versus 2004 both latin america and europecisafrica increased 27 middle east  asia increased 22 and north america increased 21 the strong activity levels around the world reflected the growing response to the current narrow margin of excess production capacity 

pretax operating income of 281 billion in 2005 was 56 higher than in 2004 demonstrating high demand for oilfield services and accelerating technology delivery both higher activity and stronger pricing contributed to the sharp increase in pretax operating margins that strengthened across all oilfield services geographic areas 

pricing showed strong improvement in north america and continued to make excellent progress internationally customer concern over the availability of certain services and products coupled with recognition of elements of cost inflation has led to inclusion of priceescalation clauses in longerterm contracts 

activity increased universally with the largest growth recorded in the geomarkets in canada us land perucolombiaecuador russia nigeria australasia saudi arabia and the arabian gulf both organic growth and acquisitions contributed to the more than 50 revenue growth in russia in 2005 versus 2004 

demand for all technologies increased sharply but particularly for well services and well completions  productivity services technology introduction accelerated during the year the scope family of drilling  measurements services for improved drilling performance and enhanced formation evaluation met growing acceptance as customers realized step changes in wellplacement accuracy in several geographical areas during 2005 schlumberger also launched the scanner family of wireline logging services a revolutionary suite of downhole rock and fluid characterization measurements

revenue of 376 billion increased 21 over 2004 mainly driven by canada and us land which benefited from strong well services and drilling  measurements activity coupled with strong pricing improvements 

the canada geomarket experienced strong equipment and personnel utilization higher pricing and increased demand for hightier services 

the robust growth in us land resulted from the combination of positive trends in activity and favorable pricing 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

during the third quarter activity was severely disrupted in the gulf of mexico with more than 25 days of operating time lost due to the disastrous hurricane season damage sustained by production platforms and mobile offshore drilling units led to reduced activity throughout the third quarter with some lingering effect in the fourth quarter 

pretax operating income of 933 million was 80 higher than in 2004 led by us land and canada the steep growth was primarily due to doubledigit price increases particularly for well services wireline and drilling  measurements technologies new technology introduction and continuing activity growth also contributed to these results the severe hurricane season in the gulf of mexico in 2005 had an estimated impact of approximately 70 million in lost revenue and 52 million in lost pretax operating income 

  

latin america 

  

revenue of 221 billion in 2005 increased 27 over 2004 with the highest growth recorded in the perucolombiaecuador and latin america south geomarkets 

mexico recorded significant revenue growth mainly due to a high number of wells being completed on the burgos project coupled with an overall rise in thirdparty managed services revenue 

activity in venezuela increased primarily from ipm and well services operations during the year continued progress was highlighted with the signing of a shortterm renewable agreement with pdvsa in early 2005 relating to the drilling barges work discussions regarding the settlement of certain outstanding receivables were still ongoing at yearend 

the perucolombiaecuador geomarket contributed significantly to the revenue growth due to the start of several new drilling  measurements contracts for the expanding customer base 

the growth in the latin america south geomarket was primarily driven by increased ipm activity although brazil experienced strong activity from the deployment of drilling  measurements and wireline technologies 

pretax operating income of 330 million in 2005 increased 49 versus 2004 this strong increase in operating income resulted mainly from an improved drilling environment in venezuela coupled with stronger operating efficiencies in well services and drilling  measurements services and across all geomarkets particularly in the perucolombiaecuador geomarket 

  

europecisafrica 

  

revenue of 353 billion in 2005 increased 27 over 2004 with the highest growth recorded in the russia and nigeria geomarkets 

strong revenue increases were recorded offshore nigeria and in deepwater west africa geomarket operations mainly benefiting well completions  productivity wireline and drilling  measurements with the rapid market acceptance of scope technology 

the cis reached revenue of 117 billion an increase of 42 over 2004 the significant increase in revenue in russia was due to a combination of organic growth and the impact of the acquisitions of petroalliance and the siberian geophysical company organic growth in russia was driven by a recovery in activity for yuganskneftegaz during the first quarter increased demand for stimulation and cementing services strengthening of ipm operations and robust uptake of new technology 

pretax operating income of 704 million in 2005 increased 57 compared to 2004 nigeria and west africa contributed significantly due to increased activity pricing improvements and accelerated technology deployment operating income in the north africa geomarket also increased markedly due to the growing presence of international oil companies in the region the north sea geomarket was a strong contributor to operating income through increased drilling activity and strong demand for production technologies from well services and wireline

middle east  asia 

  

revenue of 303 billion in 2005 increased 22 over 2004 with the highest growth recorded in the australasia bruneimalaysiaphilippines saudi arabia and gulf geomarkets 

the importance of the middle east in responding to the current lack of spare production capacity is reflected in the strong activity plans that were implemented in the region in 2005 the marked revenue growth seen in the saudi arabia geomarket was principally due to the increase in rig count as saudi aramco continued to increase activity in line with its announced spending plans 

east africa  east mediterranean geomarket growth was mainly due to the expanded market for drilling  measurements and the start of a new wireline campaign in the gulf geomarket the startup of wireline services for petroleum development oman pdo and burgeoning gas activity in qatar also contributed to the revenue growth the arabian the gulf and east africa  east mediterranean geomarkets recorded revenue increases of more than 30 and operating income growth of more than 40 

the solid contribution from the bruneimalaysiaphilippines geomarket was mainly due to higher customer expenditures improved pricing and a move by several operators into increased deepwater exploration uniquely benefiting schlumberger technologies 

activity in china strengthened throughout the year as a result of accelerated adoption of advanced drilling  measurements and wireline technologies 

australasia experienced a robust revenue growth rate mainly due to rising development activity in offshore australia combined with growing landbased activity in new zealand 

pretax operating income of 871 million in 2005 increased 34 compared to 2004 the steady increase in operating income and operating margins throughout the year was due to activity improvement across all geomarkets and significant price increases – principally in drilling  measurements well completions  productivity and wireline technologies – coupled with the startup of new projects throughout the area improved results of the bokor integrated project in the bruneimalaysiaphilippines geomarket also contributed to the operating income growth

equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 

  

the equity in net earnings of affiliated companies primarily represents schlumberger’s share of the results of its 40 interest in the mi swaco drilling fluids joint venture with smith international inc 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense of 2349 million in 2006 increased by 378 million compared to 2005 the weighted average borrowing rates of 46 increased in 2006 from 44 in 2005 the weighted average debt balance of 51 billion in 2006 increased by 609 million compared to 2005 primarily due to the funding of the westerngeco transaction described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

interest expense in 2004 of 272 million included a net charge of 64 million related to the united states interest rate swaps see charges and credits excluding this net charge interest expense decreased 11 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to a 865 million decrease in average debt balances partially offset by an increase in the weighted average borrowing rates from 39 to 44

income taxes 

  

the reported effective tax rate including charges and credits  was 240 in 2006 229 in 2005 and 209 in 2004 the charges and credits noted below decreased the effective rate by 15 in 2005 and increased the effective tax rate by 04 in 2004 the impact of charges and credits on the effective tax rate in 2006 was not significant 

the effective tax rate in 2005 reflects the impact of the 163 million gain on the sale of the montrouge facility this transaction allowed for the utilization of a deferred tax asset that was previously offset by a valuation allowance and had the effect of lowering the effective tax rate during 2005 by 13 excluding the impact of this transaction the effective tax rate was relatively flat in 2006 as compared to 2005 

the increase in the reported effective tax from 2004 to 2005 is primarily attributable to the country mix of results in oilfield services which experienced a higher proportion of pretax profitability in highertax jurisdictions in 2005 this increase was somewhat mitigated by the impact of the 163 million gain on the sale of the montrouge facility this transaction as described above had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate in 2005

business divestitures – discontinued operations 

  

during 2003 schlumberger began an active program to divest of all of its nonoilfield services businesses which was completed in 2005 these divestitures which were accounted for as discontinued operations  are more fully described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements  as a result of these transactions schlumberger generated cash including proceeds from the sale of securities received of approximately 28 million in 2005 and 293 billion in 2004 these proceeds were primarily used to further schlumberger’s deleveraging efforts 

  

the following table summarizes the results of these discontinued operations 

  

   

stockbased compensation and other 

  

stockbased compensation expense was 114 million in 2006 compared to 40 million in 2005 this increase is principally attributable to the following i the adoption of fas 123r as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements  which requires companies to expense the unamortized portion of stock options granted prior to 2003 when schlumberger adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123 ii 2006 was the first year that the full 4year impact of the adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123 adopted by schlumberger in january 2003 was reflected in schlumberger’s results and iii valuations of 2006 stockbased compensation awards increased due to the upward movement in schlumberger’s stock price as compared to prior years 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

stockbased compensation expense is currently estimated to be approximately 150 million in 2007 this represents an increase of approximately 36 million as compared to 2006 and is primarily attributable to i the fact that schlumberger began granting restricted stock in 2006 to a targeted population of employees in order to promote retention and this practice is expected to continue in future years and ii the impact of increased valuations of stockbased compensation awards due to the upward movement in schlumberger’s stock price as compared to prior years 

during 2006 schlumberger relocated its united states corporate office from new york to houston and its united states research center from ridgefield to boston schlumberger incurred approximately 30 million of incremental expenses in connection with these moves in 2006 the vast majority of these costs were incurred in the third and fourth quarters of 2006 10 million in the third quarter 15 million in the fourth quarter 

  

cash flow 

  

“net debt” is gross debt less cash shortterm investments and fixed income investments held to maturity management believes that net debt provides useful information regarding the level of schlumberger’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt and that the level of net debt provides useful information as to the results of schlumberger’s deleveraging efforts details of the change in net debt follows

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain a summary of all of schlumberger’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

multiclient seismic data 

  

the westerngeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 was 227 million 222 million and 347 million respectively such costs are charged to cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however except as described below under “ westerngeco purchase accounting ” under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightlined amortized value 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library future cash flows are analyzed based on two pools of surveys united states and nonunited states the united states and nonunited states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 

  

westerngeco purchase accounting 

  

as described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements  on april 28 2006 schlumberger acquired the 30 minority interest in westerngeco from baker hughes incorporated for 24 billion in cash as a result of this transaction schlumberger owns 100 of westerngeco 

during the process of allocating the purchase price to the proportionate share of net assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values schlumberger made certain significant estimates and assumptions relating to the accounting for westerngeco’s vessels and multiclient seismic data 

in analyzing the fair value of the westerngeco vessels it was determined that the remaining estimated useful lives of these assets exceeded the remaining estimated life currently being used to calculate depreciation expense therefore the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels were extended an additional 4 years on a weighted average basis as of the date of the acquisition the impact of the fair value adjustments for all fixed assets combined with the change in estimate regarding the depreciable lives of the vessels resulted in a net reduction in depreciation expense of approximately 2 million in 2006 

the carrying value of the multiclient library immediately after the acquisition increased to 243 million from 202 million reflecting the impact of a 41 million fair value adjustment these capitalized costs will be charged to cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs on the balance sheet to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data schlumberger policy has been that under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value after consideration of the estimated number of future years that revenues are expected to be derived from the multiclient seismic data at the time of the acquisition schlumberger concluded that the remaining minimum amortization period should be 3 years for all surveys in the multiclient seismic library at the time of the transaction effectively resetting the minimum amortization period therefore the 243 million of capitalized multiclient seismic data costs will be charged to expense over a period no longer than the next 3 years from the date of the transaction surveys comprising the 202 million of multiclient seismic data costs prior to this transaction had a weighted average remaining life for purposes of computing the minimum amortization of approximately 18 years given the current emphasis on requiring multiclient projects to be significantly prefunded before the project commences schlumberger currently estimates that the majority of revenues to be derived from sales of new surveys will be achieved within a 4year period therefore schlumberger will continue its policy that under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightline amortized value for all surveys added to the library after the date of this transaction 

the net impact of the 41 million fair value adjustment combined with the resetting of the minimum amortization period resulted in an approximate 28 million net reduction in multiclient amortization expense in 2006 as compared to what multiclient amortization expense would have been had this transaction not been consummated 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value a significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices customer satisfaction claims and pricing discrepancies depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments adjustments to the allowance may be required 

  

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

  

schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of schlumberger’s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by sfas 142 schlumberger’s reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the oilfield services segment in addition to the westerngeco segment schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis andor applying various market multiples from time to time a thirdparty valuation expert may be utilized to assist in the determination of fair value determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions schlumberger’s estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units were significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for 2006 2005 and 2004 

  

longlived assets including fixed assets and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management in order to estimate the fair value of a longlived asset schlumberger may engage a thirdparty to assist with the valuation if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 

  

income taxes 

  

schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the over 100 jurisdictions in which it conducts business these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations it is possible that 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

  

contingencies 

  

the consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for estimated future expenditures relating to contractual obligations associated with business divestitures that have been completed it is possible that the ultimate expenditures may differ from the amounts recorded in the opinion of management such differences are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity financial position or future results of operations 

the consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for the estimated future costs associated with certain environmental remediation activities related to the past use or disposal of hazardous material where it is probable that schlumberger has incurred a liability and such amount can be reasonably estimated substantially all such costs relate to divested operations and to facilities or locations that are no longer in operation due to a number of uncertainties including uncertainty of timing the scope of remediation future technology regulatory changes natural resource or property damage claims and other factors it is possible that the ultimate remediation costs may exceed the amounts estimated however in the opinion of management any such additional costs are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity financial position or future results of operations 

  

pension and postretirement benefits 

  

schlumberger’s pension benefit and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations the discount rate utilized to determine both the liability for schlumberger’s united states pension plans and for schlumberger’s united states postretirement medical plans was increased from 575 at december 31 2005 to 600 at december 31 2006 the discount rate utilized to determine expense for schlumberger’s united states pension plans and postretirement medical plans was reduced from 600 in 2005 to 575 in 2006 the change in the discount rate was made to reflect market interest rate conditions a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases expense 

the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the expected rate of return on plan assets was 850 in both 2006 and 2005 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in both 2006 and 2005 was 10 graded to 6 over the next four years and 5 thereafter

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

schlumberger is subject to market risk primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger conducts its business in approximately 80 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar which is consistent with the oil and gas industry approximately 80 of schlumberger’s operating revenue in 2006 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses are incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will decrease 

a 5 change in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in 2006 would have changed operating revenue by approximately 1 if the 2006 average exchange rates of the us dollar against all foreign currencies had strengthened by 5 schlumberger’s income from continuing operations would have increased by 2 conversely a 5 weakening of the us dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income from continuing operations by 3 

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates foreign currency forward contracts provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on assetsliabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses 

on december 31 2006 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 29 billion in various foreign currencies these contracts mature on various dates in 2007 

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixedrate debt together with interest rate swaps where appropriate to fix or lower borrowing costs 

at december 31 2006 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 28 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately 32 billion 

  

part ii item 7a 

  

  

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also somewhat mitigated by its investment portfolio both shortterm investments and fixed income investments held to maturity  which totaled approximately 30 billion at december 31 2006 are comprised primarily of eurodollar time deposits certificates of deposit and commercial paper euronotes and eurobonds and are substantially all denominated in us dollars the average return on investment was 45 in 2006 

the following table represents principal amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 2006 by year of maturity 

  

   

the 15 series a convertible debentures and the 2125 series b convertible debentures are convertible at the holders’ option into shares of schlumberger common stock holders of the series a debentures may convert their debentures into common stock at a conversion rate of 27651 shares for each 1000 principal amount of series a debentures equivalent to an initial conversion price of 36165 per share holders of the series b debentures may convert their debentures into common stock at a conversion rate of 25000 shares for each 1000 principal amount of series b debentures equivalent to an initial conversion price of 4000 per share each conversion rate may be adjusted for certain events but it will not be adjusted for accrued interest 

on or after june 6 2008 in the case of the series a convertible debentures or june 6 2010 in the case of the series b convertible debentures schlumberger may redeem for cash all or part of the applicable series of debentures upon notice to the holders at the redemption prices of 100 of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption on june 1 2008 june 1 2013 and june 1 2018 holders of series a debentures may require schlumberger to repurchase their series a debentures on june 1 2010 june 1 2013 and june 1 2018 holders of series b debentures may require schlumberger to repurchase their series b debentures the repurchase price will be 100 of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date the repurchase price for repurchases on june 1 2008 in the case of the series a debentures and june 1 2010 in the case of the series b debentures will be paid in cash on the other repurchase dates schlumberger may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash or common stock or any combination of cash and common stock in addition upon the occurrence of a fundamental change defined as a change in control or a termination of trading of schlumberger’s common stock holders may require schlumberger to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures for an amount equal to 100 of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date the repurchase price may be paid in cash schlumberger common stock or if schlumberger is not the surviving entity in a merger the securities of the surviving entity or a combination of cash and the applicable securities at schlumberger’s option the applicable securities will be valued at 99 of their market price schlumberger’s option to pay the repurchase price with securities is subject to certain conditions the debentures will mature on june 1 2023 unless earlier redeemed or repurchased 

  

part ii item 7a 

  

  

the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 38 billion as of december 31 2006 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2006 was approximately 51 

on december 31 2006 interest rate swap arrangements outstanding were pay floatingreceive fixed on us dollar debt of 68 million these arrangements mature at various dates to december 2009 interest rate swap arrangements decreased consolidated interest expense in 2006 by 08 million 

schlumberger does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate derivatives for speculative purposes

 item 1a risk factors 

  

we urge you to carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this report if any of the matters described below or elsewhere in this report were to occur our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations 

  

demand for the majority of our oilfield services is substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry a substantial or an extended decline in oil or gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry and reduce our revenue 

  

demand for the majority of our oilfield services is substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves which are sensitive to oil and natural gas prices and generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and gas prices oil and gas prices have historically been volatile and are affected by numerous factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

part 1 item 1a 

  

  

the oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns which have been characterized by diminished demand for our oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could harm our operating results 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our nonunited states operations which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the more than 80 countries in which we operate 

  

our nonunited states operations accounted for approximately 75 of our consolidated revenue in 2005 and 74 in both 2004 and 2003 operations in countries other than the united states are subject to various risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries including iran syria sudan libya and cuba which are subject to trade economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the united states government 

the occurrence of any of the risks described above could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 

  

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations

executive overview 

  

schlumberger consists of two business segments oilfield services and westerngeco 

oilfield services experienced strong growth in 2005 with a sharp rise in operating margins due to increasing activity strong pricing momentum and accelerated technology introduction oil prices ended the year 41 higher than at the beginning of the year while natural gas prices surged 82 over the same period 

in the united states the absence of a meaningful increase in natural gas production supported strong natural gas prices in 2005 which averaged more than 9 per mmbtu in 2005 additionally the devastating hurricane season resulted in a severe disruption of the already stretched united states oil industry eastern hemisphere activity grew significantly but is still at a fairly early stage with the supply response only now translating into increased exploration development and production maintenance operations in key international areas such as russia and the middle east internationally projects ramped up throughout the year supporting a steady growth in 2005 growing levels of activity and increasing preparations for new projects in the eastern hemisphere indicate a trend that is expected to continue in 2006 

westerngeco delivered excellent results demand for seismic acquisition principally marine as well as multiclient data indicate a strong renewed interest in exploration the continued acceptance of q technology resulted in impressive growth which is expected to continue in 2006 

in russia the cooperation and confidence established during the initial period of our minority holding of petroalliance services company limited russia’s largest independent oilfield services company has confirmed our belief that the company will play a major role in our continued expansion schlumberger acquired an additional 25 equity stake in petroalliance in 2005 bringing schlumberger’s total ownership to 51 schlumberger initially acquired 26 in the second quarter of 2004 the acquisition of the remaining 49 of the company is expected to be completed in 2006 subject to performance requirements regulatory approval and other customary provisions 

recent seismic logging and well testing contracts show a renewed interest in exploration in both new and existing areas this shift together with increasing customer spending tightening service industry resources and faster deployment of new technologies creates an environment in which schlumberger is well positioned 

ongoing supply constraints and resilient demand growth support highenergy prices with opec giving the market strong signals that it considers the 50 to 70 range per barrel for wti west texas intermediate to be appropriate limited spare production capacity combined with geopolitical tensions that threaten supply availability provide upside potential for oil prices supply problems may prove even more severe for natural gas as accelerated production decline rates and limited ability to increase drilling activity continue to challenge united states and canadian gas producers 

iea international energy agency projections show oil demand growth continuing at an annual rate of about 18 million barrels per day to 2 million barrels per day through to 2010 to reach a total of approximately 925 million barrels per day this represents an increase of nearly 9 million barrels per day over demand in 2005 the iea also show supply capacity growth just matching demand growth in 2007 2008 and 2010 with capacity growth managing to increase slightly faster than demand in 2006 and 2009 in short based on the iea numbers the degree of spare upstream capacity is not expected to increase significantly before the end of the decade 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

several trends will define activity in 2006 first rig count increases will be largely limited to onshore work as the global offshore rig market will remain constrained until new builds are mobilized beyond 2006 second shortages of people and equipment across the industry are likely to result in cost inflation and project delays placing a high premium on reliable suppliers of both technology and skilled personnel third the technology that can improve the productivity of the limited base of skilled personnel will be in high demand this is clearly demonstrated both by the success of schlumberger petrel seismictosimulation software tools and by growing acceptance of the remote monitoring of job execution to achieve superior performance from technology fourth exploration activity where schlumberger has an unmatched portfolio of services is expected to show a large increase in 2006 and to continue for a number of years 

the industry has already recognized the need for an unprecedented effort to increase secure hydrocarbon supply plans are being put in place to achieve this but it will take several years of sustained activity to develop the new production that can reliably replace today’s supply much of which was developed during the upcycle of the 1970s and 1980s in addition this new supply will generally come from smaller reservoirs and more hostile environments where schlumberger is uniquely placed to meet the challenge 

the following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  

  

   

pretax segment income represents the business segments’ income before taxes and minority interest pretax segment income excludes corporate expenses interest income interest expense amortization of certain intangibles interest on postretirement benefits stockbased compensation costs and the charges and credits described in detail in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements as these items are not allocated to the segments 

  

oilfield services 

  

2005 results 

  

revenue of 1265 billion increased 24 in 2005 versus 2004 both latin america and europecisafrica increased 27 middle east  asia increased 22 and north america increased 21 the strong activity levels around the world reflected the growing response to the current narrow margin of excess production capacity 

pretax operating income of 281 billion in 2005 was 56 higher than in 2004 demonstrating high demand for oilfield services and accelerating technology delivery both higher activity and stronger pricing contributed to the sharp increase in pretax operating margins that strengthened across all oilfield services geographical areas 

pricing showed strong improvement in north america and continued to make excellent progress internationally customer concern over the availability of certain services and products coupled with recognition of elements of cost inflation has led to inclusion of priceescalation clauses in longerterm contracts 

activity increased universally with the largest growth recorded in the geomarkets in canada us land perucolombiaecuador russia nigeria australasia saudi arabia and the arabian gulf both organic growth and acquisitions contributed to the more than 50 revenue growth in russia in 2005 versus 2004 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

demand for all technologies increased sharply but particularly for well services and well completions  productivity services technology introduction accelerated during the year the scope family of drilling  measurements services for improved drilling performance and enhanced formation evaluation met growing acceptance as customers realized step changes in wellplacement accuracy in several geographical areas during the year schlumberger also launched the scanner family of wireline logging services a revolutionary suite of downhole rock and fluid characterization measurements 

  

north america 

  

revenue of 376 billion increased 21 over 2004 mainly driven by canada and us land which benefited from strong well services and drilling  measurements activity coupled with strong pricing improvements 

the canada geomarket experienced strong equipment and personnel utilization higher pricing and increased demand for hightier services 

the robust growth in us land resulted from the combination of positive trends in activity and favorable pricing 

during the third quarter activity was severely disrupted in the gulf of mexico with more than 25 days of operating time lost due to the disastrous hurricane season damage sustained by production platforms and mobile offshore drilling units led to reduced activity throughout the third quarter with some lingering effect in the fourth quarter 

pretax operating income of 933 million was 80 higher than in 2004 led by us land and canada the steep growth was primarily due to doubledigit price increases particularly for well services wireline and drilling  measurements technologies new technology introduction and continuing activity growth also contributed to these results the severe hurricane season in the gulf of mexico had an estimated impact of approximately 70 million in lost revenue and 52 million in lost pretax operating income 

  

latin america 

  

revenue of 221 billion in 2005 increased 27 over 2004 with the highest growth recorded in the perucolombiaecuador and latin america south geomarkets 

mexico recorded significant revenue growth mainly due to a high number of wells being completed on the burgos project coupled with an overall rise in thirdparty managed services revenue 

activity in venezuela increased primarily from ipm and well services operations during the year continued progress was highlighted with the signing of a shortterm renewable agreement with pdvsa in early 2005 for operations on the prisa project discussions regarding the settlement of certain outstanding receivables were still on going at yearend 

the perucolombiaecuador geomarket contributed significantly to the revenue growth due to the start of several new drilling  measurements contracts for the expanding customer base 

the growth in the latin america south geomarket was primarily driven by increased ipm activity although brazil experienced strong activity from the deployment of drilling  measurements and wireline technologies 

pretax operating income of 330 million in 2005 increased 49 versus 2004 this strong increase in operating income resulted mainly from an improved drilling environment in venezuela coupled with stronger operating efficiencies in well services and drilling  measurements services and across all geomarkets particularly in the perucolombiaecuador geomarket 

  

europecisafrica 

  

revenue of 353 billion in 2005 increased 27 over 2004 with the highest growth recorded in the russia and nigeria geomarkets 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

strong revenue increases were recorded offshore nigeria and in deepwater west africa geomarket operations mainly benefiting well completions  productivity wireline and drilling  measurements with the rapid market acceptance of scope technology 

the cis reached a new revenue record at 117 billion an increase of 42 over 2004 the significant increase in revenue in russia was due to a combination of organic growth and the impact of the acquisitions of petroalliance and the siberian geophysical company organic growth in russia was driven by a recovery in activity for yuganskneftegaz during the first quarter increased demand for stimulation and cementing services strengthening of ipm operations and robust uptake of new technology 

pretax operating income of 704 million in 2005 increased 57 compared to 2004 nigeria and west africa contributed significantly due to increased activity pricing improvements and accelerated technology deployment operating income in the north africa geomarket also increased markedly due to the growing presence of international oil companies in the region the north sea geomarket was a strong contributor to operating income through increased drilling activity and strong demand for production technologies from well services and wireline 

  

middle east  asia 

  

revenue of 303 billion in 2005 increased 22 over 2004 with the highest growth recorded in the australasia bruneimalaysiaphilippines saudi arabia and gulf geomarkets 

the importance of the middle east in responding to the current lack of spare production capacity is reflected in the strong activity plans that were implemented in the region in 2005 the marked revenue growth seen in the saudi arabia geomarket was principally due to the increase in rig count as saudi aramco continued to increase activity in line with their announced spending plans 

east africa  east mediterranean geomarket growth was mainly due to the expanded market for drilling  measurements and the start of a new wireline campaign in the gulf geomarket the startup of wireline services for petroleum development oman pdo and burgeoning gas activity in qatar also contributed to the revenue growth the arabian the gulf and east africa  east mediterranean geomarkets recorded revenue increases of more than 30 and operating income growth of more than 40 

the solid contribution from the bruneimalaysiaphilippines geomarket was mainly due to higher customer expenditures improved pricing and a move by several operators into increased deepwater exploration uniquely benefiting schlumberger technologies 

activity in china strengthened throughout the year as a result of accelerated adoption of advanced drilling  measurements and wireline technologies 

australasia experienced a robust revenue growth rate mainly due to rising development activity in offshore australia combined with growing landbased activity in new zealand 

pretax operating income of 871 million in 2005 increased 34 compared to 2004 the steady increase in operating income and operating margins throughout the year was due to activity improvement across all geomarkets and significant price increases—principally in drilling  measurements well completions  productivity and wireline technologies—coupled with the start up of new projects throughout the area improved results of the bokor integrated project in the bruneimalaysiaphilippines geomarket also contributed to the operating income growth 

  

2004 results 

  

revenue of 1024 billion increased 16 in 2004 versus 2003 north america increased 18 middle east  asia increased 19 and latin america increased 21 europecisafrica was up by 4 pretax operating income of 180 billion in 2004 was 17 higher than in 2003 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

activity increased in almost all regions with the largest growth recorded in the geomarkets in india mexico russia east africa and the eastern mediterranean and the caspian russia continued to make impressive progress with growth exceeding our expectations despite the absence of any activity for yuganskneftegaz at the end of the year 

demand for all technologies increased particularly for drilling  measurements technologies including the powerdrive and newly introduced powerv rotarysteerable systems as well as wireline abc analysis behind casing and pressurexpress services increased demand for well services production technologies also contributed significantly to the growth these technologies included the successful launch of the powerclean system an integrated solution for optimizing production through wellbore fill removal using coiled tubing well completions  productivity technologies also showed strong growth for productionbased technology services while ipm activity continued its expansion the rate of new technology introductions is expected to accelerate over the coming twoyear period 

offshore and deepwater activity in india utilizing wireline drilling  measurements and well completions  productivity technologies continued to drive significant yearonyear growth growth in india was supported by the award of a completion sales tender for subsurface safety valves and a threeyear contract for wireline logging on onshore fields for ongc valued at more than 125 million 

during the year schlumberger opened a technology hub on the campus of the gubkin russian state university of oil and gas russia’s leading oil and gas educational establishment the hub complements other schlumberger research and engineering activities in russia 

shell international exploration and production bv and schlumberger information solutions formed an alliance for the research and development of nextgeneration smart fields™ hydrocarbon development solutions 

  

north america 

  

revenue of 311 billion increased 18 over 2003 led principally by canada and us land which benefited from the strong performance of most technologies coupled with pricing improvements particularly for well services 

growth in canada was due to increased activity and substantially higher pricing 

us land delivered robust revenue growth primarily due to continued favorable oil and gas industry dynamics the expansion of the unconventional gas market an improved pricing environment as a result of tighter resource availability and strong overall market demand combined with increasing demand for abc technologies and drilling  measurements powerdrive rotarysteerable systems these technology advances are demonstrating value and are helping drive activity while enabling price increases and efficiency gains 

pretax operating income of 519 million was 42 higher than in 2003 due mainly to increased operating leverage in us land with doubledigit price improvements in well services and wireline technologies over 2003 averages in canada increased activity coupled with sustained pricing improvements and the favorable exchange rate effect led to a notable improvement in operating income 

at the end of the year the technology component of turnkey service revenue in the gulf of mexico was evaluated against our objectives but proved insufficient to outweigh the risk associated with the turnkey drilling business model as a result the decision was made to exit the activity 

  

latin america 

  

revenue of 175 billion grew 21 over 2003 as all the geomarkets except venezuela posted revenue increases record revenue in mexico was mainly due to pemex drilling activity coupled with higher levels of ipm activity 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

increasing demand for ipm services in argentina an increase in wireline activity associated with the peruvian jungle operations and growing demand for rotary steerable systems in brazil also contributed to the revenue growth 

in venezuela revenue decreased slightly on lower activity with pdvsa due to ongoing contract negotiation on certain integrated projects 

pretax operating income of 221 million was flat over 2003 the substantial revenue growth did not materialize into higher operating income mainly because of a larger contribution of schlumbergermanaged thirdparty services on ipm projects in mexico as well as an unfavorable revenue mix in mexico additionally throughout the year certain barges in west venezuela were partially idled while contractual negotiations continued with pdvsa 

  

europecisafrica 

  

revenue of 279 billion increased 7 over 2003 mainly due to russia the caspian and west africa with gains recorded in all technologies led by drilling  measurements and well services 

cis revenue reached 825 million a 33 increase over 2003 activity was particularly sustained in russia mainly due to the continued expansion of the customer base and the deployment of new productionrelated technologies the revenue growth was tempered by the halt of activities for yuganskneftegaz in russia in the fourth quarter however successful redeployment of the equipment previously working for yuganskneftegaz was completed by the end of the year 

west africa continued to deliver robust performance achieving record activity levels mainly due to the development of deepwater projects combined with price increases through the introduction of new services and increasing demand for well services and well completions  productivity technologies 

pretax operating income of 447 million declined 3 over 2003 mainly due to persistent union strikes in norway redeployment costs and associated decreased operating efficiency in russia weak results in north africa and the appreciation of local currencies against the us dollar these were partially offset by the continued strengthening of activity in continental europe and the caspian 

  

middle east  asia 

  

revenue in 2004 reached 248 billion increasing 19 over 2003 the geomarkets in the middle east malaysia and india primarily drove the growth activity in saudi arabia was focused on increasing production capacity which resulted in higher levels of drilling activity throughout the year this trend is expected to continue in 2005 india reached record revenue with the rampup in deepwater activity for ongc and deepwater exploration activity for reliance industries ltd activity in qatar continued to increase due to ongoing gas development projects in the north field also contributing to the record revenue level was the start of a new fracturing campaign in oman demand for well completions  productivity technologies was particularly strong mainly in the gulf from projects with rasgas in saudi arabia from the commissioning of the abu safah project and in malaysia from higher testing activities and artificial lift sales 

pretax operating income of 649 million increased 27 over 2003 primarily driven by india due to a substantial increase in deepwater activity combined with strong technology deployment the ramp up of favorable projects in the gulf improved pricing on contract renewals and new technology introductions 

key technology solutions that were deployed included the chdt cased hole dynamic tester tool part of the suite of abc technology services was used to identify a highpressured zone in a depleted reservoir in china to acquire pressures and fluid samples in saudi arabia and abu dhabi and to acquire samples and pressure readings in malaysia 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

in the gulf demonstrated service quality and the introduction of new technology services led to the award of major contracts in qatar and oman these included a 320 million multiyear wireline and tubing conveyed perforating contract by pdo for their north and south operations

2005 results 

  

operating revenue for 2005 was 166 billion versus 124 billion in 2004 this strong performance was mainly attributable to the continued market acceptance of qtechnology a higher level of multiclient sales and improved operating leverage in marine acquisition 

backlog reached an alltime high of 790 million at the end of 2005 compared to 670 million at the end of last year reflecting increasing exploration and production budgets for 2006 

qtechnology revenues reached 399 million in 2005 representing 24 of total revenue in 2005 more than doubling the 162 million achieved in 2004 utilization of the five qequipped vessels reached 93 in the fourth quarter of 2005 qtechnology revenue is expected to grow by another 80 in 2006 

multiclient sales increased 17 to 509 million mainly in north america due to an especially strong central gulf of mexico lease sale higher sales in asia the caspian south america and west africa—reflecting an improved explorationspending environment approximately 64 of the multiclient surveys sold in 2005 had no net book value due to prior amortization of capitalized costs compared to approximately 52 in 2004 and only 77 of the revenue related to surveys that were impaired in 2003 and 2002 

marine activity grew 63 mainly from strong activity in the north sea asia india and the gulf of mexico combined with higher vessel utilization steady price increases and more favorable contractual terms regarding risk sharing with customers for downtime 

land activity increased 31 mainly in the middle east reflecting higher activity in saudi arabia algeria and kuwait the land seismic crew count increased from 18 at the end of 2004 to 24 at the end of 2005 

data processing increased 14 reflecting higher acquisition volumes higher levels of qprocessing and higher activity in south america and russia 

pretax operating income reached 317 million in 2005 compared to 124 million in 2004 due to accelerating demand for qmarine coupled with improved pricing and increased vessel utilization together with strong multiclient sales 

driven by qmarine demand westerngeco announced plans to convert two more vessels to qtechnology standards the first the western regent  was completed and began operations in june of 2005 while the second western monarch  is expected to enter service in the second quarter of 2006 

  

2004 results 

  

the revenue increase of 5 to 124 billion in 2004 from 118 billion in 2003 was mainly attributable to the successful expansion of qtechnology together with strong multiclient sales q revenues grew from 79 million in 2003 to 162 million in 2004 

multiclient sales increased 24 to 436 million mainly in the gulf of mexico driven by the renewed interest in the library resulting from a higher oil price environment and an increasing number of blocks in the gulf of mexico coming up for renewal approximately 52 of the multiclient surveys sold in 2004 had no net book value due to prior amortization of capitalized costs and only 5 of the revenue related to surveys that were impaired in 2003 and 2002 

land activity decreased 8 reflecting the completion of some projects in malaysia and the middle east and the shutdown of several crews active in the previous year in alaska mexico and west africa 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

marine activity declined 3 mainly as a result of the decision to reduce the number of vessels in the westerngeco fleet coupled with adverse weather in latin america lower activity in the caspian and a high number of vessel transits at the end of the year marine activity in the first half of 2005 is expected to recover with higher vessel utilization and improved pricing 

data processing increased 6 reflecting higher acquisition volumes higher levels of q processing and robust thirdparty work coupled with improved operational efficiencies 

pretax operating income reached 124 million in 2004 compared to a loss of 20 million in 2003 due to lower amortization cost following the impairments of the multiclient library in 2003 and 2002 coupled with savings related to restructuring measures taken in 2003 accelerating demand for reservoirfocused qmarine activity together with strong multiclient sales data processing also contributed to this improvement due to better operating efficiency 

the westerngeco backlog at the end of the year reached 670 million increasing 64 over 2003 of which 86 is committed over the next year 

  

interest and other income 

  

interest and other income consisted of the following 

  

   

   

interest income 

  

the average return on investment increased from 2 in 2004 to 33 in 2005 and the average investment balance of 30 billion in 2005 increased 297 million compared to 2004 

the average return on investment in 2004 was 2 a reduction of 04 compared to 2003 due to lower interest rates the average investment balance in 2004 was 27 billion an increase of 567 million over 2003 

  

equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 

  

the equity in net earnings of affiliated companies primarily represents schlumberger’s share of the results of its 40 interest in a drilling fluids joint venture that it operates with smith international inc 

  

interest expense 

  

excluding the impact of the net 64 million charge in 2004 related to the united states interest rate swaps see charges and credits interest expense decreased 11 million in 2005 to 197 million the weighted average borrowing rates increased from 39 in 2004 to 44 in 2005 while the average debt balance of 45 billion in 2005 decreased by 865 million compared to 2004 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

interest expense in 2004 of 272 million included a net charge of 64 million related to the united states interest rate swaps excluding the net charge interest expense decreased 126 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to a 2 billion decrease in average debt balances and a decrease in the weighted average borrowing rates from 46 to 39 

  

other 

  

gross margin was 258 212 and 159 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the charges and credits noted on page 24 of this report adversely impacted the gross margin by 04 and 47 in 2004 and 2003 charges and credits had an insignificant impact on the 2005 gross margin gross margin increased from 212 in 2004 to 258 in 2005 primarily due to a combination of record activity levels in oilfield services with operations at capacity in a number of regions and continued pricing improvements in both oilfield services and westerngeco 

as a percentage of revenue research  engineering marketing and general  administrative expenses are as follows 

  

   

research and engineering expenditures by segment were as follows 

  

   

income taxes 

  

the reported effective tax rate including charges and credits  was 229 in 2005 209 in 2004 and 460 in 2003 the charges and credits noted on page 24 of this report decreased the effective rate by 15 in 2005 and increased the effective tax rate by 04 in 2004 and 212 in 2003 

the increase in the reported effective tax from 2004 to 2005 is primarily attributable to the country mix of results in oilfield services which experienced a higher proportion of pretax profitability in highertax jurisdictions in 2005 this increase was mitigated primarily by the impact of the 163 million gain on the sale of the montrouge facility this transaction allowed for the utilization of a deferred tax asset that was previously offset by a valuation allowance 

the decrease in the reported effective tax rate from 2003 to 2004 was primarily the result of a significant amount of nontax effective charges in 2003 including 168 million of charges related to the extinguishment of european debt as well as changes in the country mix of earnings in westerngeco 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

charges and credits 

  

during each of 2005 2004 and 2003 schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in continuing operations these charges and credits which are summarized below are more fully described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements  

the following is a summary of the 2005 charges and credits 

  

   

the following is a summary of the 2004 charges and credits 

  

   

the following is a summary of the 2003 charges and credits 

  

   

business divestitures – discontinued operations 

  

during 2003 schlumberger began an active program to divest of all of its nonoilfield services businesses which was completed in 2005 these divestitures which were accounted for as discontinued operations  are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements  as a result of these transactions schlumberger generated cash including proceeds from the sale of securities received of approximately 28 million in 2005 293 billion in 2004 and 299 million in 2003 these proceeds have been primarily used to further schlumberger’s deleveraging efforts 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

the following table summarizes the results of these discontinued operations 

  

   

stockbased compensation and other 

  

stockbased compensation expense was approximately 40 million in 2005 and is currently estimated to be approximately 110 million in 2006 this increase will be principally due to i the adoption of fas 123r as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements  which requires companies to expense the unamortized portion of stock options granted prior to 2003 when schlumberger adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123 ii 2006 will be the first year that the full 4year impact of the adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123 adopted by schlumberger in january 2003 will be reflected in schlumberger’s results and iii valuations of 2006 stockbased compensation awards are expected to increase due to the recent upward movement in schlumberger’s stock price 

during 2006 schlumberger will relocate its united states corporate office from new york to houston schlumberger will also relocate its united states research center from ridgefield to boston in 2006 schlumberger currently estimates that it will incur approximately 25 million to 30 million in incremental expenses in connection with these moves in 2006 

  

cash flow 

  

in 2005 cash provided by operations was 30 billion as net income plus depreciation  amortization were partly offset by increases in customer receivables and inventories due to higher operating revenues 

cash used in investing activities was 204 billion and included investments in fixed assets 159 billion and multiclient seismic data 60 million the purchase of shortterm investments 707 million proceeds from the sale of the montrouge facility 230 million and the sale of the investment in hanover compressor 110 million 

cash used in financing activities was 994 million with the proceeds from employee stock plans 345 million offset by the payment of dividends to shareholders 482 million the repurchase of 764 million shares of schlumberger stock 612 million and an overall reduction in debt of 216 million 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

“net debt” is gross debt less cash shortterm investments and fixed income investments held to maturity management believes that net debt provides useful information regarding the level of schlumberger’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt and that the level of net debt provides useful information as to the results of schlumberger’s deleveraging efforts details of the change in net debt follows 

  

   

   

   

at december 31 2005 cash and shortterm investments of 35 billion and the remaining credit facilities of 44 billion are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next twelve months 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

summary of major contractual commitments 

  

   

refer to note 5 of the consolidated financial statement for details regarding potential commitments associated with schlumberger’s prior business acquisitions 

schlumberger has outstanding letters of creditguarantees which relate to business performance bonds customexcise tax commitments facility leaserental obligations etc these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain a summary of all of schlumberger’s significant accounting policies are included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

multiclient seismic data 

  

the westerngeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data such costs are charged to cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightlined amortized value 

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library future cash flows are analyzed based on two pools of surveys united states and nonunited states the united states and nonunited states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 

schlumberger recorded an impairment charge relating to the multiclient library of 398 million in 2003 the carrying value of the library at december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 was 222 million 347 million and 506 million respectively following the 2003 impairment charge schlumberger will not generally commence a multiclient project unless the project is significantly prefunded by one or more customers the reduction in the carrying value of the library over recent years is primarily attributable to a cautious approach to new investment combined with the significant prefunding requirement 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value a significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices customer satisfaction claims and pricing discrepancies depending on how such potential issues are resolved or if the financial condition of schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments adjustments to the allowance may be required 

  

inventory reserves 

  

schlumberger writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

  

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

  

schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of schlumberger’s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by sfas 142 schlumberger’s reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the oilfield services segment in addition to the westerngeco segment schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis andor applying various market multiples from time to time a third party valuation expert may be utilized to assist in the determination of fair value determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions schlumberger’s estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units was significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

longlived assets including fixed assets and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management in order to estimate the fair value of a longlived asset schlumberger may engage a thirdparty to assist with the valuation if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

investments 

  

schlumberger and smith international inc operate a drilling fluids joint venture of which schlumberger owns a 40 interest and records income using the equity method of accounting schlumberger’s investment at december 31 2005 and 2004 was 802 million and 716 million respectively the carrying value of this joint venture is evaluated for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates that a decline in the fair value of this investment that is other than temporary has occurred fair value is generally estimated by comparing the significance of this joint venture to smith international inc a publicly traded company and then referencing the market capitalization of smith international inc to date schlumberger has not recorded any impairment charges relating to this investment as this analysis has indicated that the fair value of this investment is significantly in excess of its carrying value 

  

income taxes 

  

schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the jurisdictions in which it conducts business these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the year in which such resolution occurs 

schlumberger had net deferred tax assets of 564 million at december 31 2005 which excluded 213 million relating to net operating losses in certain countries for which there is a valuation allowance in assessing the need for valuation allowances schlumberger considers the likelihood of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 

  

contingencies 

  

the consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for the estimated future costs associated with certain environmental remediation activities related to the past use or disposal of hazardous material where it is probable that schlumberger has incurred a liability and such amount can be reasonably estimated substantially all such costs relate to divested operations and to facilities or locations that are no longer in operation due to a number of uncertainties including uncertainty of timing the scope of remediation future technology regulatory changes natural resource or property damage claims and other factors it is possible that the ultimate remediation costs may exceed the amounts estimated however in the opinion of management any such additional costs are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity financial position or future results of operations 

the consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for estimated future expenditures relating to potential contractual obligations associated with business divestitures which have been completed it is possible that the ultimate expenditures may differ from the amounts recorded in the opinion of management such differences are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity financial position or future results of operations 

in december 2004 westerngeco and schlumberger received grand jury subpoenas from the united states attorney’s office in the southern district of texas seeking documents relating to possible fraud in obtaining visas for nonunited states citizens working as crewmembers on vessels operating in the gulf of mexico we are in the process of responding to the investigation including providing information sought by the subpoenas schlumberger is currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter and the related impact it might have on schlumberger’s financial position and results of operations 

  

part ii item 7 

  

  

pension and postretirement benefits 

  

schlumberger’s pension benefit and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate we use reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations the discount rate utilized to determine both the accumulated benefit obligation “abo” for schlumberger’s united states pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation “apbo” for schlumberger’s united states postretirement medical plans was reduced from 600 at december 31 2004 to 575 at december 31 2005 the discount rate utilized to determine expense for schlumberger’s united states pension plans and postretirement medical plans was reduced from 625 in 2004 to 600 in 2005 the change in the discount rate was made to reflect market interest rate conditions a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases expense 

the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid the expected rate of return for schlumberger’s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the expected rate of return on plan assets was 850 in both 2005 and 2004 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in 2005 was 10 graded to 6 over the next six years and 5 thereafter the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in 2004 was 10 graded to 5 over the next five years and 5 thereafter 

  

the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions holding all other assumptions constant for the united states pension plans

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

schlumberger is subject to market risk primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

as a multinational company schlumberger conducts its business in over 80 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar which is consistent with the oil and gas industry approximately 80 of schlumberger’s operating revenue in 2005 was denominated in us dollars however outside the united states a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses are incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will decrease 

a 5 change in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in 2005 would have changed operating revenue by approximately 1 if the 2005 average exchange rates of the us dollar against all foreign currencies had increased by 5 schlumberger’s income from continuing operations would have increased by 4 conversely a 5 weakening of the us dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income from continuing operations by 4 

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates foreign currency forward contracts provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on assetsliabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses option contracts are usually entered into as a hedge against currency variations on firm commitments generally involving the construction of longlived assets 

on december 31 2005 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 19 billion in various foreign currencies these contracts mature on various dates in 2006 

schlumberger does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate derivatives for speculative purposes 

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixedrate debt together with interest rate swaps where appropriate to fix or lower borrowing costs 

at december 31 2005 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 28 billion and variable rate debt aggregating 16 billion 

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also somewhat mitigated by its investment portfolio both shortterm investments and fixed income investments held to maturity  which totaled approximately 37 billion at december 31 2005 are comprised primarily of eurodollar time deposits certificates of deposit and commercial paper euronotes and eurobonds and are substantially all denominated in us dollars the average return on investment was 33 in 2005

the following table represents principal amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 2005 by year of maturity 

  

   

on or after june 6 2008 in the case of the series a convertible debentures or june 6 2010 in the case of the series b convertible debentures schlumberger may redeem for cash all or part of the applicable series of debentures upon notice to the holders at the redemption prices of 100 of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption on june 1 2008 june 1 2013 and june 1 2018 holders of series a debentures may require schlumberger to repurchase their series a debentures on june 1 2010 june 1 2013 and june 1 2018 holders of series b debentures may require schlumberger to repurchase their series b debentures the repurchase price will be 100 of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date the repurchase price for repurchases on june 1 2008 in the case of the series a debentures and june 1 2010 in the case of the series b debentures will be paid in cash on the other repurchase dates schlumberger may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash or common stock or any combination of cash and common stock in addition upon the occurrence of a fundamental change defined as a change in control or a termination of trading of schlumberger’s common stock holders may require schlumberger to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures in cash or at schlumberger’s election common stock valued at 99 of its market price or any combination of cash and common stock at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date the debentures will mature on june 1 2023 unless earlier redeemed or repurchased 

the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 34 billion as of december 31 2005 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2005 was approximately 48 

on december 31 2005 interest rate swap arrangements outstanding were pay floatingreceive fixed on us dollar debt of 93 million these arrangements mature at various dates to december 2009 interest rate swap arrangements decreased consolidated interest expense in 2005 by 3 million

the following discussion of results should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 

  

2004 summary 

  

schlumberger consists of two business segments oilfield services and westerngeco 

  

the year marked the transformation of schlumberger into a pure oilfield services company with a clear record for growth and technology leadership income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest was 13 billion in 2004 compared to 457 million in 2003 the 2004 and 2003 results include pretax charges of 243 million and 638 million respectively which are described in detail on pages 22 to 25 the growth in earnings from continuing operations far exceeded the 15 growth in revenue 

  

oilfield services reached new revenue and pretax operating income records of 1024 billion and 180 billion respectively strong growth was experienced in all areas but most notably in north america middle east and asia pretax return on sales for the full year was 176 considerably higher than the 15 objective set in march of 2003 

  

westerngeco returned to profitability with pretax operating income of 124 million versus a loss of 20 million in 2003 our approach has been threefold to bring capacity and cost down to appropriate levels to take a cautious approach to new investment in the data library and to continue aggressive introduction of q technology the keys to success are industry discipline in managing capacity but above all clear demonstration of the differentiation in qtechnology qrevenue more than doubled from 79 million in 2003 to 162 million in 2004 

  

our divestiture program of nonoilfield businesses is now complete  during 2004 we finalized the sale of schlumbergersema completed the initial public offering of axalto and divested of substantially all remaining nonoilfield businesses as a result net debt fell below 15 billion at december 31 2004 and is at a level consistent with the longerterm capital structure of schlumberger 

  

in may 2004 schlumberger completed the acquisition of a 26 equity stake in petroalliance russia’s largest independent oilfield service company a further 25 stake is expected to be acquired in the first half of 2005 we also finalized the acquisition of sgk a joint venture with which we have been associated with for the past four years in russia the market potential in russia is substantial and this type of investment will benefit schlumberger and the russian oil industry by facilitating growth through access to technology 

  

in june 2004 we outlined our growth strategy with a particular focus on the productionoriented environment new and increased investment in additional production capacity largely in the international and deepwater markets where schlumberger is strongest 

  

coupled with the requirement to prolong production from existing reservoirs will be reflected in higher levels of oilfield service activity for many years to come seventy percent of today’s oil production comes from fields that have been in production for more than thirty years as these fields continue to age their performance declines and remedial actions are required to maintain their output the significance of this can be seen from the fact that as much as threequarters of today’s investment in the upstream industry is directed at such activity–with the remaining quarter being spent on developing new sources of oil for the future there are three key avenues that schlumberger intends to exploit in addition to maintaining our leading position in exploration and development technology for harsh and complex environments 

  

first schlumberger already has broad geographical spread however our strong positions in the strategically important areas for new production in the middle east the caspian and in deepwater regions provide a unique growth opportunity schlumberger sees the largest opportunity to be in russia as well as to some extent in china 

  

the second avenue for growth is through technology both developed internally and acquired externally a wide range of internally developed products and services has created a portfolio targeted at growth in the productionoriented market schlumberger’s research and engineering expenditures have been relatively constant while the rate of introduction of new products and services is accelerating we consider complementary technology acquisition with subsequent enhancement and integration into our portfolio to be an ongoing feature of our future growth 

  

the third avenue of growth for schlumberger will be our ability to perform reservoiroriented project management conceived largely as a well construction business and confirmed by successful execution of projects such as burgos in mexico integrated project management ipm is now developing more and more expertise in the execution of projects designed to boost production in mature areas 

  

early in 2004 we set a number of new financial goals for the company these included the anticipation that the compound annual growth rate in revenue would be in double digits throughout the remainder of the decade  although such growth may not be linear as the industry will remain to some extent cyclical an aftertax returnonsales target before minority interests of 15 including westerngeco and a target return on capital employed consistently in the upper teens 

  

the following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  

  

   

   

oilfield services 

  

as the year progressed oil prices continued to climb rising from 3250 per barrel on january 1 st to 38 per barrel at the end of june to a record of over 55 per barrel in late october despite oil trading on average some 15 per barrel higher in 2004 than in 2003 robust world demand growth of over 2 million barrels per day continued throughout the second half of 2004 consumption especially in the us and china pushed demand to an average 825 million barrels per day in 2004 a yearonyear growth of 33 and the sharpest growth rate since 1976 supply growth in 2004 was restrained by a number of factors that when added together resulted in an extremely tight supplydemand balance that pushed prices higher than prior year forecasts the factors that created this tight environment are expected to remain in 2005 including strong oil demand geopolitical tension a stretched refining system relatively low crude and product inventories limited spare production capacity and a weak us dollar accordingly most forecasts call for some early 2005 softening in prices after a relatively mild winter followed by average oil prices at or slightly above 2004 levels the main risks to this scenario remain a dramatic slowing of world economic growth and supply side disruption 

  

upstream exploration and production ep spending trended higher in 2004 up an estimated 13 over 2003 international spending accounting for over 70 of the total saw the largest gain of 14 while north america was up 11 exploration spending remained flat in 2004 while development and production saw the majority of the increase as operators focused on maintaining production in aging fields worldwide rig counts were up 13 over 2003 

  

the outlook for 2005 remains robust with the industry now clearly focused on the need to build additional supply capacity for both oil and gas this is evidenced by increased new field development plans as well as unprecedented efforts to increase production and recovery from existing reservoirs exploration especially in challenging environments such as deep water should see a substantial increase in 2005 strong market fundamentals our extensive technology portfolio and unique global workforce make us ideally placed to grow in this environment 

  

2004 results 

  

revenue of 1024 billion increased 16 in 2004 versus 2003 north america increased 18 middle east  asia increased 19 and latin america increased 21 europeciswest africa was up by 4 pretax operating income of 180 billion in 2004 was 17 higher than in 2003 

  

activity increased in almost all regions with the largest growth recorded in the geomarkets in india mexico russia east africa and the eastern mediterranean and the caspian russia continued to make impressive progress with growth exceeding our expectations despite the absence of any activity for yuganskneftegas at the end of the year 

  

demand for all technology services increased but particularly for drilling  measurements technologies including the powerdrive and newly introduced powerv rotary steerable systems as well as wireline analysis behind casing and pressurexpress services increased demand for well services production technologies also contributed significantly to the growth these technologies included the successful launch of the powerclean system an integrated solution for optimizing production through wellbore fill removal using coiled tubing the well completions  productivity technology service also showed strong growth for productionbased technologies while ipm activity continued its expansion the rate of new technology introductions is expected to accelerate over the coming twoyear period 

  

offshore and deepwater activity in india utilizing wireline drilling  measurements and well completions  productivity technologies continued to drive significant yearonyear growth growth in india was supported by the award of a completion sales tender for subsurface safety valves and a threeyear contract for wireline logging on onshore fields for ongc valued at more than 125 million 

  

during the year schlumberger opened a technology hub on the campus of the gubkin russian state university of oil and gas russia’s leading oil and gas educational facility the hub complements other schlumberger research and engineering activities in russia 

  

shell international exploration and production bv and schlumberger information solutions established an alliance for research and development of next generation smart fields ™ hydrocarbon development solutions 

  

north america 

  

revenue of 311 billion increased 18 over 2003 led principally by canada and us land which benefited from the strong performance of most technology services coupled with pricing improvements particularly for well services 

  

growth in canada was due to increased activity and substantially higher pricing 

  

us land delivered robust revenue growth primarily due to continued favorable oil and gas industry dynamics the expansion of the unconventional gas market an improved pricing environment as a result of tighter resource availability and strong overall market demand combined with increasing demand for abc analysis behind casing technologies and drilling  measurements powerdrive rotary steerable systems these technology advances are demonstrating value and are helping drive activity while enabling price increases and efficiency gains 

  

pretax operating income of 519 million was 42 higher than in 2003 due mainly to increased operating leverage in us land with doubledigit price improvements in wireline and well services over 2003 averages in canada increased activity coupled with sustained pricing improvements and the favorable exchange rate effect led to a notable improvement in operating income 

  

at the end of the year the technology component of turnkey service revenue in the gulf of mexico was evaluated against our objectives but proved insufficient to outweigh the risk associated with the turnkey drilling business model as a result the decision was made to exit the activity 

  

latin america 

  

revenue of 175 billion grew 21 over 2003 as all the geomarkets except venezuela posted revenue increases record revenue in mexico was mainly due to pemex drilling activity coupled with higher levels of ipm activity 

  

increasing demand for integrated project management in argentina an increase in wireline activity associated with the peruvian jungle operations and growing demand for rotary steerable systems in brazil also contributed to the revenue growth 

  

in venezuela revenue decreased slightly on lower activity with pdvsa due to ongoing contract negotiation on certain integrated projects 

  

pretax operating income of 221 million was flat over 2003 the substantial revenue growth did not materialize into higher operating income mainly because of a larger contribution of schlumbergermanaged thirdparty services on ipm projects in mexico as well as an unfavorable revenue mix in mexico additionally throughout the year certain barges in west venezuela were partially idled while contractual negotiations continued with pdvsa 

  

a key contract award during the fourth quarter of 2004 included a new 350well ipm contract in the burgos basin for pemex in mexico the multiyear contract value is estimated at 550 million and will include drilling and completion work for development and appraisal gas wells 

  

europeciswest africa 

  

revenue of 279 billion increased 7 over 2003 mainly due to russia the caspian and west africa with gains recorded in all technology services led by drilling  measurements and well services 

  

cis reached a new revenue record at 825 million a 33 increase over 2003 activity was particularly sustained in russia mainly due to the continued expansion of the customer base and the deployment of new productionrelated technologies the revenue growth was tempered by the halt of activities for yuganskneftegas in russia in the fourth quarter however successful redeployment of the equipment previously working for yuganskneftegas was completed by the end of the year 

  

west africa continued to deliver robust performance achieving record activity levels mainly due to the development of deepwater projects combined with price increases through the introduction of new services and increasing demand for well services and well completions  productivity technology services 

  

pretax operating income of 447 million declined 3 over 2003 mainly due to persistent union strikes in norway redeployment costs and associated decreased operating efficiency in russia weak results in north africa and the appreciation of local currencies against the us dollar these were partially offset by the continued strengthening of activity in continental europe and the caspian 

  

in russia sibneft awarded schlumberger a contract for more than 100 million to provide well construction and stimulation services in western siberia 

  

middle east  asia 

  

revenue in 2004 reached a record of 248 billion increasing 19 over 2003 the geomarkets in the middle east malaysia and india primarily drove the growth activity in saudi arabia was focused on increasing production capacity which resulted in higher levels of drilling activity throughout the year this trend is expected to continue in 2005 india reached record revenue with the rampup in deepwater activity for ongc and deepwater exploration activity for reliance industries ltd activity in qatar continued to increase due to ongoing gas development projects in the north field also contributing to the record revenue level was the start of a new fracturing campaign in oman demand for well completions  productivity technologies was particularly strong mainly in the gulf from projects with rasgas in saudi arabia from the commissioning of the abu safah project and in malaysia from higher testing activities and artificial lift sales 

  

pretax operating income of 649 million increased 27 over 2003 primarily driven by india due to a substantial increase in deepwater activity combined with strong technology deployment the ramp up of favorable projects in the gulf improved pricing on contract renewals and new technology introductions 

  

key technology solutions that were deployed included the chdt cased hole dynamic tester tool part of the suite of abc analysis behind casing technology services was used to identify a highpressured zone in a depleted reservoir in china to acquire pressures and fluid samples in saudi arabia and abu dhabi and to acquire samples and pressure readings in malaysia 

  

in the gulf demonstrated service quality and the introduction of new technology services led to the award of major contracts in qatar and oman these included a 320 million multiyear wireline and tubing conveyed perforating contract by petroleum development oman pdo for their north and south operations 

  

2003 results 

  

revenue of 88 billion increased 8 in 2003 versus 2002 led by north america with an increase of 14 followed by latin america and middle east  asia which both increased 9 and europeciswest africa which was up 4 pretax operating income of 154 billion in 2003 was 20 higher than in 2002 primarily due to strong customer demand resulting from increased ep expenditures and customer acceptance of new technologies overhead cost savings of 67 million generated from restructuring and downsizing efforts principally in europeciswest africa and north  south america also contributed to the increased profitability during the year 

  

oilfield services began the year with relatively flat revenue in the first quarter then achieved modest but continuous growth over the following three quarters due to new contracts the introduction of new technologies and increased demand for integrated project management the results were positively impacted by an upturn in natural gas drilling in north america and increased activity in mexico russia and the middle east partially offset by a nationwide strike in venezuela and unrest in nigeria 

  

all technology product lines helped drive revenue growth well services and drilling  measurements’ record levels of revenue contributed to more than half of the increase in oilfield services revenue data  consulting services drew the award of several contracts for reservoir modeling field development planning and production optimization integrated project management experienced high activity levels principally fueled by latin america 

  

north america 

  

north america revenue of 26 billion increased 14 versus 2002 the growth in revenue was mainly due to increased activity in us land as well as canada both markets were driven by strong commodity prices which in turn were caused by the record low gas storage levels at the end of the 2003 drawdown season this growth was not mirrored in the gulf of mexico where activity was essentially flat yearonyear 

  

pretax operating income of 365 million increased 33 over 2002 primarily due to a beneficial fallthrough resulting from improved equipment utilization in us land following asset rationalization and cost containment increased demand for drilling  measurements cased hole wireline and hydraulic fracturing solutions related to increased complexity in developing new gas reserves in us land also contributed to profitability improvement 

  

latin america 

  

latin america revenue of 14 billion increased 9 versus 2002 primarily due to substantial increases in mexico brazil and argentina partially offset by a significant decline in venezuela largescale project management contracts substantially accounted for the growth in activity in mexico growth in brazil was driven by a strong increase in petrobras exploration activity and argentina benefited from the high oil price 

  

the political turmoil in the early part of the year substantially impacted results in venezuela however the focus on restoring production favorably drove the revenue in the latter half of the year the increase in ep spending in mexico was driven by the compelling need to satisfy the domestic demand for natural gas increase the light oil production and rampup the oil production potential key contracts that contributed to revenue growth included project management of a fouryear 500 million integrated oilfield services project which represents the most significant oil development project in mexico in the last 20 years 

  

pretax operating income of 221 million was up 31 yearonyear with all areas excluding venezuela contributing to improved profitability there were record levels of integrated project management contracts in mexico and positive fallthrough on incremental revenue in argentina and brazil 

  

europeciswest africa 

  

revenue of 26 billion increased 4 over 2002 primarily in russia due to growth in ep spending and continued expansion of the addressable market which drove increased fracturing activity high sales of artificial lift pumps and the adoption of more advanced drilling technologies cis reached a record revenue level of 629 million 22 higher than 2002 an increase in the number of ep companies entering the development phase of deepwater projects in west africa during the second half of 2003 also contributed to overall activity improvement in the area principally in well completions  productivity and well services technologies these results were partially offset by lower exploration activity by the major oil companies in the north sea and by production shutdowns in the western niger delta in nigeria due to sociopolitical unrest 

  

pretax operating income of 460 million increased 20 over 2002 primarily due to cost savings generated at the beginning of the year as well as increased activities in west africa due to deepwater activities moving into a more lucrative development phase 

  

middle east  asia 

  

revenue of 21 billion increased 9 over 2002 with more than half the growth coming from saudi arabiakuwait egypt and indonesia despite geopolitical uncertainty in the period leading up to the war in iraq and relative softness in asia principally caused by the sars outbreak revenue showed marked improvement primarily due to higher demand for drilling  measurements wireline and well completion  productivity technologies in egypt saudi arabiakuwait and indonesia partially offset by reduced activity in malaysia bruneiphilippines due to the suspension of planned deepwater development work resulting from the deepwater acreage dispute between malaysia and brunei 

  

pretax operating income of 509 million increased 12 primarily due to the operating leverage on increased revenue across most geomarkets principally caused by increased activity in indonesia and stimulation activity and artificial lift sales in east africa 

  

2002 results 

  

revenue for 2002 was 82 billion versus 84 billion in 2001 reflecting reduced activity in north america and latin america which was partially mitigated by higher activity in europecisw africa and the middle east  asia pretax operating income of 13 billion decreased 19 primarily from reduced margins in wireline and well services as activity declined in north america 

  

a sharp fall in revenue at the beginning of 2002 reflected declining activity levels in north america which remained depressed for the remainder of the year together with political and economic uncertainty in latin america in the second and third quarters robust activity in europecisw africa and signs of a possible recovery in asia mitigated the effects of low north american drilling levels resulting in increased revenue however this trend was shortlived as slower activity outside north america due mainly to seasonal influences coupled with budget cuts resulted in lower fourth quarter revenue 

  

from a technology standpoint the strongest performer was well completions  productivity where acquisitions testing advanced completions systems and artificial lift technology showed market share gains 

  

during 2002 schlumberger acquired a comeau  associates limited a leading provider of electrical engineering products and services for artificially lifted wells this addition combined with the successful integration of sensa and phoenix technologies into the schlumberger artificial lift services portfolio contributed to higher sales in 2002 particularly in the eastern hemisphere the drilling  measurements technology service also recorded solid revenue growth fuelled largely by the continued penetration of the powerdrive475 rotary steerable system into new geomarkets 

  

schlumberger made two further acquisitions during 2002 to bolster its realtime reservoir management suite of services in january schlumberger acquired norwegianbased inside reality as providing new 3d virtual reality systems that create a unique and powerful environment for interactive well planning and realtime geosteering analysis schlumberger also acquired the software and services business of technoguide as a leader in the reservoir modeling domain 

  

north america 

  

revenue of 23 billion decreased 19 versus 2001 a steep revenue decline at the outset of the year reflected a continued lackluster drilling environment and unseasonably mild weather conditions throughout the remainder of the year activity levels remained depressed resulting in essentially flat revenue for 2002 other factors contributing to reduced revenue included lower nonrig related activity resulting in lower wireline well services and well completions  productivity revenue the effects of the tropical storms in the third quarter of 2002 and a slow pickup in canadian activity post spring breakup in 2002 

  

pretax operating income of 274 million decreased from 637 million in 2001 due to pricing pressures across all services particularly in well services and well completions  productivity 

  

latin america 

  

revenue of 13 billion decreased 9 versus 2001 ongoing political and economic uncertainty in the region continued to affect business conditions particularly in venezuela and argentina this particularly impacted results in the first half of the year in sharp contrast the second half of 2002 saw solid growth partly as a result of higher demand for drilling  measurements and well completions technologies connected to contracts in the burgos basin 

  

pretax operating income of 169 million declined 8 as a result of decreased activity in venezuela and argentina 

  

europeciswest africa 

  

revenue of 25 billion increased 17 versus 2001 strong revenue growth was recorded in the first three quarters of 2002 reflecting increased activity levels and market share gains particularly in the caspian and russia geomarkets in respect to artificial lift and drilling technologies the well completions  productivity and drilling  measurements technologies recorded the strongest growth this growth was partially mitigated by a steep revenue drop in the fourth quarter of 2002 due to exceptionally severe winter weather conditions in the north sea and russia that affected all services in addition operator budget cuts in the nigeria geomarket and refocused investment decisions in the uk contributed to lower fourth quarter revenue 

  

pretax operating income was 383 million compared to 385 million in 2001 with the very slight decrease due to softening in pricing towards the end of the year and restructuring in the region to reduce support infrastructure to match slowing activity levels 

  

middle east  asia 

  

revenue of 19 billion increased 8 versus 2001 after a decline at the beginning of 2002 resulting from exceptional artificial lift sales at the end of 2001 the asian market showed signs of recovery highlighted by strong revenue growth in the second quarter over the year the india and malaysiabruneiphilippines geomarkets recorded the strongest growth due to increased activity in these countries in addition the wireline and well services technologies posted the highest growth this was partly offset by a slowdown in activity in the second half of 2002 due to a number of major projects nearing completion and lower equipment sales 

  

pretax operating income of 453 million was up 9 versus 2001

2004 results 

  

the revenue increase of 5 to 124 billion in 2004 from 118 billion in 2003 was mainly attributable to the successful expansion of qtechnology together with strong multiclient sales qrevenue grew from 79 million in 2003 to 162 million in 2004 with a similar growth rate expected in 2005 

  

multiclient sales increased 24 to 436 million mainly in the gulf of mexico driven by the renewed interest in the library resulting from a higher oil price environment and an increasing number of blocks in the gulf of mexico coming up for renewal approximately 47 of the multiclient surveys sold in 2004 had no net book value due to prior amortization of capitalized costs and only 5 of the surveys sold were impaired in 2003 and 2002 

  

land activity decreased 8 reflecting the completion of some projects in malaysia and the middle east and the shutdown of several crews active in the previous year in alaska mexico and west africa 

  

marine activity declined 3 mainly as a result of the decision to reduce the number of vessels in the westerngeco fleet coupled with adverse weather in latin america lower activity in the caspian and a high number of vessel transits at the end of the year marine activity in the first half of 2005 is expected to recover with higher vessel utilization and improved pricing 

  

data processing increased 6 reflecting higher acquisition volumes higher levels of qprocessing and robust thirdparty work coupled with improved operational efficiencies 

  

pretax operating income reached 124 million in 2004 compared to a loss of 20 million in 2003 due to lower amortization cost following the impairments of the multiclient library in 2003 and 2002 coupled with savings related to restructuring measures taken in 2003 accelerating demand for reservoirfocused qmarine activity together with strong multiclient sales data processing also contributed to this improvement due to better operating efficiency 

  

the westerngeco backlog at the end of the year reached 670 million increasing 64 over 2003 of which 86 are committed over the next year 

  

driven by qmarine vessel utilization westerngeco decided to convert the western regent vessel to qtechnology the vessel is scheduled for deployment in the first half of 2005 

  

2003 results 

  

revenue in 2003 was 12 billion versus 15 billion in 2002 a 20 decrease which was primarily due to lower land crew activity following the exiting of the north american land market combined with the completion of some contracts in the middle east the decrease in revenue was also due to declines in multiclient sales principally in north  south america partially offset by increased marine activity in europe caspian and the middle east qmarine continued to gain customer acceptance the end of 2003 saw a return to traditional seasonal multiclient revenue levels partially helped by the signing of a longterm business agreement with a major energy company that included the licensing of part of the westerngeco data library as well as joint rd and training on new technology for seismic data processing 

  

qmarine continued to command significant pricing premiums as a result of the added value obtained from the delivered product but pricing across other business segments was flat to down for conventional marine land and data processing activity due to continued overcapacity in the industry qmarine penetration continued strong reflected by the doubling of qrevenue yearonyear 

  

pretax operating loss was 20 million versus a profit of 71 million in 2002 excluding multiclient impairment and other charges in both years described on page 24 mainly due to significantly higher multiclient amortization charges as a result of lower estimated future revenues the lower multiclient sales were primarily due to an overall lessening in interest in the gulf of mexico from the major oil companies coupled with an average price reduction of approximately 30 during the year 

  

the westerngeco backlog at the end of the year reached 408 million 

  

2002 results 

  

westerngeco revenue of 15 billion decreased 13 compared to 2001 primarily due to decreased activity in north america and europecisw africa which were partially offset by increases in latin america and the middle east  asia 

  

the seismic downturn continued throughout 2002 resulting in significantly lower activity levels a reduction in multiclient sales and extreme pricing pressures on all services due to large overcapacity in the seismic industry significant workforce reductions were made in the fourth quarter of 2002 as a result of the decision to stop land acquisition activities in the us lower 48 states and canada 

  

pretax operating income of 71 million fell 68 in 2002 primarily due to significantly lower multiclient sales and decreased activities in north america coupled with land seismic contract losses in mexico and marine seismic contract losses in india both of which were related to production delays

interest expense in 2004 of 272 million included a pretax charge of 73 million and a pretax credit of 10 million related to us interest rate swaps see charges continuing operations  excluding these items interest expense decreased 126 million in 2004 due to a 2 billion decrease in average debt balances and a decrease in the weighted average borrowing rates from 46 to 39 the decrease in 2003 of 34 million to 334 million was due to a decrease in average debt balances of 185 million and a decrease in the weighted average borrowing rates from 49 to 46 the decrease in 2002 of 17 million to 368 million was due to a decrease in the weighted average borrowing rates from 58 to 49 which more than offset a 1 billion increase in average debt balances 

  

interest income 

  

interest income of 56 million in 2004 was 4 million higher than 2003 the average return on investment in 2004 was 2 a reduction of 04 compared to 2003 due to lower interest rates the average investment balance in 2004 was 27 billion an increase of 567 million over 2003 due to cash flow from operations and business divestiture proceeds the 2003 interest income of 52 million was 16 million lower than 2002 the average return on investment in 2003 decreased by 14 to 24 compared to 2002 due to lower interest rates the average investment balance in 2003 was 22 billion an increase of 352 million over 2002 due mainly to cash flow generated by operations and the sale of hanover note

schlumbergersema goodwill and other charges – discontinued operations 

  

on december 10 2002 schlumberger announced that the board of directors had approved an updated strategy for its schlumbergersema business segment the new strategic plan outlook current business values and the reorganization of schlumbergersema constituted significant events that required an impairment analysis to be performed in accordance with sfas no 142 schlumbergersema was ‘valued’ on a standalone basis each reporting unit within schlumbergersema was valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on a longterm forecast prepared by schlumbergersema management with the assistance of a third party valuation expert the implied multiples yielded by the discounted cash flow analysis were compared to observed trading multiples of comparable companies and recent transactions in the it services industry to assess the fair value of the reporting units the fair value was below the book value as a result a 2638 billion pretax and aftertax goodwill impairment charge was recorded this impairment reflected the difficulties of the telecommunications industry and the severely depressed market values of the it companies serving schlumbergersema’s sector at the time of the charge certain intangible assets were also identified and written down as part of this process resulting in a 147 million pretax charge 132 million aftertax additional charges recorded included 97 million 78 million aftertax of severance facility and other costs in an effort to reduce costs at schlumbergersema and a 52 million valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset in europe 

  

the following is a summary of the above 2002 charges included in loss from discontinued operations 

  

   

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses the following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain a summary of all of schlumberger’s significant accounting policies including those discussed below are included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  

  

schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

multiclient seismic data 

  

the westerngeco segment capitalizes the cost associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data such costs are charged to cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data however under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4year straightlined amortized value 

  

the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred adjustments to the value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues which involves significant judgment on the part of schlumberger would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys significant adverse changes in schlumberger’s estimated future revenues could result in impairment charges in a future period for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library future cash flows are analyzed based on two pools of surveys us and nonus the us and nonus pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 

  

schlumberger recorded impairment charges relating to the multiclient library of 398 million in 2003 and 184 million in 2002 the carrying value of the library at december 31 2004 and 2003 was 347 million and 506 million respectively following the 2003 impairment charge schlumberger will generally not commence a multiclient project unless the project is significantly prefunded by one or more customers the reduction in the carrying value of the library from 2003 to 2004 is primarily attributable to a cautious approach to new investment combined with the significant prefunding requirement 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

schlumberger maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

inventory reserves 

  

schlumberger writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

  

goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets 

  

schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred goodwill is tested for impairment using a twostep approach the first step tests for impairment by comparing the fair value of schlumberger’s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

  

for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by sfas 142 schlumberger’s reporting units are the four geographic areas comprising the oilfield services segment and the westerngeco segment schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis andor applying various market multiples from time to time a third party valuation expert may be utilized to assist in the determination of fair value determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions schlumberger’s estimates of the fair value of each of its previously mentioned reporting units was significantly in excess of their carrying value during 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

longlived assets including fixed assets and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in reviewing for impairment the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of longlived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management in order to estimate the fair value of a longlived asset schlumberger may engage a thirdpart to assist with the valuation if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 

  

investments 

  

schlumberger and smith international inc operate a drilling fluids joint venture of which schlumberger owns a 40 interest and records income using the equity method of accounting schlumberger’s investment at december 31 2004 and 2003 was 716 million and 657 million respectively the carrying value of this joint venture is evaluated for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates that a decline in the fair value of this investment that is other than temporary has occurred fair value is generally estimated by comparing the significance of this joint venture to smith international inc a publicly traded company and then referencing the market capitalization of smith international inc to date schlumberger has not recorded any impairment charges relating to this investment as this analysis has indicated that the fair value of this investment is significantly in excess of its carrying value 

  

losses on contracts 

  

losses on contracts are provided for when such losses become known and can be reasonably estimated historically losses on contracts that have had a material impact on schlumberger’s consolidated results of operations have been rare 

  

income taxes 

  

schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the jurisdictions in which it conducts business these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances however due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates in such an event schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the year in which such resolution occurs 

  

schlumberger had net deferred tax assets of 583 million at december 31 2004 which excluded 312 million relating to net operating losses in certain countries for which there is a valuation allowance in assessing the need for valuation allowances schlumberger considers the probable likelihood of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 

  

contingencies 

  

the consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for the estimated future costs associated with certain environmental remediation activities related to the past use or disposal of hazardous material where it is probable that schlumberger has incurred a liability and such amount can be reasonably estimated substantially all such costs relate to divested operations and to facilities or locations that are no longer in operation due to a number of uncertainties including uncertainty of timing the scope of remediation future technology regulatory changes the risk of personal injury natural resource or property damage claims and other factors it is possible that the ultimate remediation costs may exceed the amounts estimated however in the opinion of management such additional costs are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity financial position or future results of operations 

  

the consolidated balance sheet included accruals for estimated future expenditures associated with business divestitures which have been completed it is possible that the ultimate expenditures may differ from the amounts recorded in the opinion of management such differences are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity financial position or future results of operations 

  

in december 2004 westerngeco and schlumberger received grand jury subpoenas from the us attorney’s office in the southern district of texas seeking documents relating to possible fraud in obtaining visas for nonus citizens working as crewmembers on vessels operating in the gulf of mexico we are in the process of responding to the investigation including providing information sought by the subpoenas schlumberger is currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter and the related impact it might have on schlumberger’s financial position and results of operations 

  

pension and postretirement benefits 

  

schlumberger’s pension benefit and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates these assumptions are important elements of expense andor liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events 

  

the discount rate we use reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of highquality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations the discount rate utilized to determine the projected benefit obligation for schlumberger’s us pension plan was reduced from 625 at december 31 2003 to 600 at december 31 2004 the discount rate utilized to determine the projected benefit obligation for schlumberger’s uk pension was reduced from 560 at december 31 2003 to 540 at december 31 2004 these changes were made to reflect market interest rate conditions a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense a change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption would have an estimated 12 million impact on annual pension expense 

  

the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid schlumberger’s expected rate of return has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class the expected rate of return on plan assets was 850 in both 2004 and 2003 a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense a change of 25 basis points in the expected rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately 4 million 

  

schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in 2004 was 10 graded to 5 over the next five years and 5 thereafter if the assumed medical cost trend rate was increased by one percentage point health care cost in 2004 would have increased by 15 million and the accumulated postretirement obligation would have increased by 137 million on december 31 2004 if the assumed medical cost trend rate was decreased by one percentage point health care cost in 2004 would have decreased by 13 million and the accumulated postretirement obligation would have decreased by 113 million on december 31 2004 

  

cash flow 

  

in 2004 cash provided by operations was 185 billion as net income plus depreciation  amortization and net charges including the extinguishment of us and european debt were only partially offset by increases in customer receivables and inventories due to higher operating revenues 

  

cash provided by investing activities was 168 billion as the proceeds from nonoilfield business divestitures 166 billion and the proceeds from the sale schlumberger’s investment of 193 million shares in of atos origin 116 billion was partially offset by investments in fixed assets 122 billion and multiclient seismic data 63 million 

  

cash used in financing activities was 359 billion with the proceeds from employee stock plans 278 million offset by the payment of dividends to shareholders 441 million the costs related to the extinguishment of certain us and european debt 111 million the repurchase of 515 million shares of schlumberger stock 320 million and an overall reduction in debt of 293 billion 

  

“net debt” is gross debt less cash shortterm investments and fixed income investments held to maturity management believes that net debt provides useful information regarding the level of schlumberger’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt and that the level of net debt provides useful information as to the results of schlumberger’s deleveraging efforts details of the change in net debt follows 

  

   

   

   

at december 31 2004 the cash and shortterm investments of 30 billion and the remaining credit facilities of 45 billion are sufficient to meet future business requirements

environmental matters 

  

the consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for the estimated future costs associated with certain environmental remediation activities related to the past use or disposal of hazardous materials substantially all such costs relate to divested operations and to facilities or locations that are no longer in operation due to a number of uncertainties including uncertainty of timing the scope of remediation future technology regulatory changes the risk of personal injury natural resource or property damage claims and other factors it is possible that the ultimate remediation costs may exceed the amounts estimated however in the opinion of management such additional costs are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity financial position or future results of operations 

  

new accounting standard 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas 123r sharebased payment the standard amends sfas 123  accounting for stock based compensation  and concludes that services received from employees in exchange for stockbased compensation results in a cost to the employer that must be recognized in the financial statements the cost of such awards should be measured at fair value at the date of grant sfas 123r provides public companies with a choice of transition methods to implement the standard schlumberger anticipates applying the modified prospective method whereby companies would recognize compensation cost for the unamortized portion of vested awards outstanding at the effective date of sfas 123r july 1 2005 for schlumberger and granted after january 1 1995 such cost will be recognized in schlumberger’s financial statements over the remaining vesting period as described in note 19 in 2003 schlumberger adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas nos 123 and 148 on a prospective basis for grants after january 1 2003 therefore effective july 1 2005 schlumberger will have to apply the provisions of sfas 123r to the unvested portion of awards granted during the period of january 1 1995 to december 31 2002 the adoption of this standard is currently expected to reduce schlumberger’s 2005 diluted earnings per share by approximately 003

as a multinational company schlumberger conducts its business in over 80 countries schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the us dollar which is consistent with the oil and gas industry approximately 85 of schlumberger’s operating revenue in 2004 was denominated in us dollars however outside the us a significant portion of schlumberger’s expenses are incurred in foreign currencies therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business the us dollarreported expenses will decrease 

  

a 5 change in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in 2004 would have changed operating revenue by approximately 1 if the 2004 average exchange rates of the us dollar against all foreign currencies had increased by 5 schlumberger’s income from continuing operations would have increased by 8 conversely a 5 weakening of the us dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income from continuing operations by 11 

  

schlumberger maintains a foreigncurrency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates forward currency contracts provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on assetsliabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses option contracts are usually entered into as a hedge against currency variations on firm commitments generally involving the construction of longlived assets 

  

on december 31 2004 contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of 11 billion in various foreign currencies these contracts mature on various dates in 2005 

  

schlumberger does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate derivatives for speculative purposes 

  

schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixedrate debt together with interest rate swaps where appropriate to fix or lower borrowing costs 

  

at december 31 2004 schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately 29 billion and variable rate debt aggregating 18 billion 

  

schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also somewhat mitigated by its investment portfolio both shortterm investments and fixed income investments held to maturity  which totaled approximately 30 billion at december 31 2004 are comprised primarily of eurodollar time deposits certificates of deposit and commercial paper euronotes and eurobonds and are substantially all denominated in us dollars the average return on investment was 2 in 2004 

  

the following table represents principal amounts of schlumberger’s debt at december 31 2004 by year of maturity 

  

   

on or after june 6 2008 in the case of the series a convertible debentures or june 6 2010 in the case of the series b convertible debentures schlumberger may redeem for cash all or part of the applicable series of debentures upon notice to the holders at the redemption prices of 100 of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption on june 1 2008 june 1 2013 and june 1 2018 holders of series a debentures may require schlumberger to repurchase their series a debentures on june 1 2010 june 1 2013 and june 1 2018 holders of series b debentures may require schlumberger to repurchase their series b debentures the repurchase price will be 100 of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date the repurchase price for repurchases on june 1 2008 in the case of the series a debentures and june 1 2010 in the case of the series b debentures will be paid in cash on the other repurchase dates schlumberger may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash or common stock or any combination of cash and common stock in addition upon the occurrence of a fundamental change defined as a change in control or a termination of trading of schlumberger’s common stock holders may require schlumberger to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures in cash or at schlumberger’s election common stock valued at 99 of its market price or any combination of cash and common stock at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date the debentures will mature on june 1 2023 unless earlier redeemed or repurchased 

  

the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately 31 billion as of december 31 2004 the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of december 31 2004 was approximately 37 

  

on december 31 2004 interest rate swap arrangements outstanding were pay floatingreceive fixed on us dollar debt of 117 million these arrangements mature at various dates to december 2009 interest rate swap arrangements increased consolidated interest expense in 2004 by 60 million including the 73 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2004 for the settlement and cancellation of 500 million outstanding interest rate swaps in the us 

  

with respect to equity market risks schlumberger’s investment portfolio includes equity investments in publicly held companies that are classified as availableforsale our investment in the hanover compressor company and other strategic equity holdings in privately held companies these securities are exposed to price fluctuations as of december 31 2004 the fair market value of schlumberger’s investment in hanover compressor of 123 million exceeded its cost basis by approximately 316 million at december 31 2003 schlumberger wrote down the cost basis of this investment to its fair market value of 914 million at december 31 2003 and recorded a pretax and aftertax impairment charge of 812 million no investment impairment charges were recorded in 2004 schlumberger’s policy is not to hedge equity price risk

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

2003 summary 

  

the year 2003 marked a watershed for schlumberger as we took the decision to focus on our core businesses in oilfield services our reasoning was simple world energy needs for much of the next halfcentury will be met mostly by carbonbased fuels produced from an aging reserves base substantial investment will be needed to sustain today’s production as well as to meet tomorrow’s demand and technology will be the key to a cleaner more costeffective response to this challenge we therefore believe the future for schlumberger is exceptionally bright 

the year’s results for oilfield services were robust with growth in all regions among the geomarket regions activity was strongest in mexico indonesia india the caspian and on land in the united states most technology segments registered doubledigit gains with records achieved by drilling  measurements and data  consulting services much of the technology that saw increasing market penetration was associated with boosting performance in mature fields or “brownfields” to stem declining production rotary steerable systems to accurately place well trajectories to tap bypassed hydrocarbon pockets and a range of casedhole wireline evaluation tools to analyze such zones were two particular successes 

a number of technical and business highlights marked the year integrated project management ipm continued to grow particularly in mexico where our history of successful projects led to the award of the chicontepec contract the most significant oil development project in mexico in the last 20 years in malaysia we signed a contract with petronas carigali sdn bhd to jointly redevelop the bokor field that began production in the 1980s this field comprising more than 165 stacked sands and over 100 producing strings has been modeled using the latest techniques and the redevelopment plan involves multiple technology segments such projects underline the value of our unique geomarket organization 

in december we announced a phased agreement to acquire petroalliance russia’s largest independent oilfield service company beginning with a minority share in 2004 petroalliance was formed in 1995 to provide a broad range of exploration and development services to international standards the size and scope of activity in russia is huge and this type of investment will benefit schlumberger and the russian oil industry as that industry seeks access to technology to be applied to its particular needs for continued growth 

perhaps the most difficult challenge we set for ourselves early in 2003 was to return westerngeco to sustainable profitability continued overcapacity in both the land and marine and multiclient data markets made this a daunting task our approach has been threefold to bring capacity and cost down to appropriate levels to reflect a proper carrying value for the data library and to continue the aggressive introduction of proprietary q technology for which the market has continued to grow rapidly 

last summer we acquired the first marine timelapse q survey for statoil 200 km from the western coast of norway twentyone months had elapsed between the two surveys initial results produced only 11 days after acquisition enabled statoil to revise plans for a new well and drill a shallower trajectory to remain clear of the oilwater contact the well was a success and is producing without making water the reliability and extremely high repeatability of qmarine technology were considered critical to achieving this result in other applications a q system was commissioned in the middle east late in the year and qseabed underwent highly successful trials in both the north sea and middle east 

in defining the business activities sold with schlumbergersema we maintained our commitment to the growing activity in oil and gas it solutions the natural fusion of the schlumberger software and information management activities with the schlumbergersema oil  gas consulting and network infrastructure businesses began in october and by yearend business managers were in place throughout the geomarket organization we have chosen to retain the schlumberger information solutions name for the enlarged business and our objective is to help customers extract more value from their core operational processes through leveraging the combination of our domain knowledge in it and in exploration and production ep 

  

   

part ii item 7 

  

early in 2003 we stated clear financial goals by yearend we had made solid progress return on capital employed had risen to 128 in the fourth quarter double the corresponding figure in 2002 and well in line with our intention to reach the midteens longer term aftertax return on sales for oilfield services reached 142 in the same quarter—a level much more consistent with our performance in previous cycles net debt fell to 42 billion just shy of our 4 billion target as a result of adverse currency movements for more information regarding the purposes for which we use net debt see page 29 of this report 

in january 2004 we concluded the sale of the major part of schlumbergersema to atos origin and reduced our holding in that company to 145 total cash proceeds from the cash and stock sale amounted to 11 billion with conclusion of the sale of the north american electricity meter business and the sales of the business continuity infodata and telecom software products businesses we expect to see net debt below the 3 billion level by the middle of 2004 beyond that point the only significant divestiture remaining will be the ipo of axalto the schlumberger smart card business as and when market conditions permit 

in 2003 schlumberger operated four business segments oilfield services westerngeco schlumbergersema and other the following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 

  

   

      

oilfield services 

  

world oil demand surged in 2003 due to strong economic growth in north america and china the increase in demand from these areas accounted for almost two thirds of overall world oil demand growth the rise in world oil production more than matched demand growth nonopec oil production accounted for one third of the increase due to expanding production in the cis opec output increased despite supply disruptions in venezuela and nigeria and the loss of iraqi production during and after the war oil prices remained high throughout the year with an average western texas intermediate wti oil price almost 20 higher than in 2002 

  

   

part ii item 7 

  

in 2004 the rate of global oil demand growth is expected to be similar to 2003 with oil demand projected to grow strongly in developing countries and ease in oecd countries nonopec oil production is forecast to grow at roughly similar levels to 2003 although there is more uncertainty over the level of supply in the cis and the us opec production is likely to be adjusted to maintain the price of the opec basket of crude in the stated target price range of 22 to 28 per barrel 

north american gas demand in 2003 showed little change compared to 2002 and is not expected to vary much in 2004 however maintaining gas supply to meet demand is challenging as production decline rates are already high and expected to increase further the average annual us natural gas price in 2003 rose considerably compared to last year and has stimulated growth in the number of active drilling rigs in north america 

relatively high commodity prices in 2003 and increases in production have resulted in high levels of cash generation in the oil and gas industry and a subsequent increase in the average number of active drilling rigs assuming demand remains strong and that opec manages to maintain oil prices in its target range exploration and production ep spending is expected to increase in 2004 

  

2003 results 

  

revenue of 88 billion increased 8 in 2003 versus 2002 led by north america with an increase of 14 followed by latin america and middle east  asia which both increased 9 and europecisw africa which was up 4 pretax operating income of 154 billion in 2003 was 20 higher than in 2002 primarily due to strong customer demand resulting from increased ep expenditures and customer acceptance of new technologies such as powerdrive rotary steerable systems litecrete coalbed methane slurry system abcanalysis behind casing suite of services viscoelastic diverting acid vda advanced acidizing system and clearfrac polymerfree fracturing fluid overhead cost savings of 67 million generated from restructuring and downsizing efforts principally in europecisw africa and north  south america also contributed to the increased profitability during the year 

oilfield services began the year with relatively flat revenue in the first quarter then achieved modest but continuous growth over the following three quarters due to new contracts the introduction of new technologies and increased demand for integrated project management and schlumberger information solutions sis services the results were positively impacted by an upturn in natural gas drilling in north america and increased activity in mexico russia and the middle east partially offset by a nationwide strike in venezuela and ethnic unrest in nigeria 

all technology product lines helped drive revenue growth well services and drilling  measurements’ record levels of revenue contributed to more than half of the increase in oilfield services revenue data  consulting services drew the award of several contracts for reservoir modeling field development planning and production optimization sis experienced strong demand particularly in europe asia and the middle east integrated project management ipm experienced high activity levels principally fueled by latin america 

in december schlumberger announced a phased agreement to acquire petroalliance beginning with a minority share in 2004 petroalliance is russia’s largest independent oilfield services company and provides a broad range of exploration and development services throughout russia and the caspian 

  

north america 

  

north america revenue of 26 billion increased 14 versus 2002 the growth in revenue was mainly due to increased activity in us land as well as canada which had a 31 increase in revenue to 410 million both markets were driven by strong commodity prices which in turn were caused by the record low gas storage levels at the end of the 2003 drawdown season this growth was not mirrored in the gulf of mexico where activity was essentially flat yearonyear a combination of factors contributed to the sluggish performance 

  

   

part ii item 7 

  

offshore including higher finding and developing cost on the shelf lack of exploration success in deepwater and unfavorable weather conditions hampering drilling and completion efficiency on a number of deepwater projects 

pretax operating income of 365 million increased 33 over 2002 primarily due to a beneficial fallthrough resulting from improved equipment utilization in us land following asset rationalization and cost containment increased demand for drilling  measurements cased hole wireline and hydraulic fracturing solutions related to increased complexity in developing new gas reserves in us land also contributed to profitability improvement 

  

latin america 

  

latin america revenue of 14 billion increased 9 versus 2002 primarily due to substantial increases in mexico brazil and argentina partially offset by a significant decline in venezuela largescale project management contracts substantially accounted for the growth in activity in mexico growth in brazil was driven by a strong increase in petrobras exploration activity and argentina benefited from the high oil price 

the political turmoil in the early part of the year substantially impacted results in venezuela however the focus on restoring production favorably drove the revenue in the latter half of the year the increase in ep spending in mexico was driven by the compelling need to satisfy the domestic demand for natural gas increase the light oil production and rampup the oil production potential key contracts that contributed to revenue growth included project management of a fouryear 500 million integrated oilfield services project which represents the most significant oil development project in mexico in the last 20 years and a twoyear 60 million information management solution

pretax operating income of 460 million increased 20 over 2002 primarily due to cost savings generated at the beginning of the year as well as increased activities in west  south africa due to deepwater activities moving into a more lucrative development phase this was partially offset by appreciation of currencies against the us dollar negatively impacting the results by 4 million later in the year

2002 results 

  

revenue for 2002 was 82 billion versus 84 billion in 2001 reflecting reduced activity in north america and latin america which was partially mitigated by higher activity in europecisw africa and the middle east  asia pretax operating income of 13 billion decreased 19 primarily from reduced margins in wireline and well services as activity declined in north america 

a sharp fall in revenue at the beginning of 2002 reflected declining activity levels in north america which remained depressed for the remainder of the year together with political and economic uncertainty in latin america in the second and third quarters robust activity in europecisw africa and signs of a possible recovery in asia mitigated the effects of low north american drilling levels resulting in increased revenue however this trend was shortlived as slower activity outside north america due mainly to seasonal influences coupled with budget cuts resulted in lower fourth quarter revenue the caspian russia and mexico geomarkets posted the highest doubledigit yearonyear revenue growth of 89 62 and 48 respectively 

from a technology standpoint the strongest performer was well completions  productivity where acquisitions testing advanced completions systems and artificial lift technology showed market share gains 

during the year schlumberger acquired a comeau  associates limited a leading provider of electrical engineering products and services for artificially lifted wells this latest addition combined with the successful integration of sensa and phoenix technologies into the schlumberger artificial lift services portfolio contributed to higher sales in 2002 particularly in the eastern hemisphere the drilling  measurements technology segment also recorded solid revenue growth fuelled largely by the continued penetration of the powerdrive475 rotary steerable system into new geomarkets 

schlumberger made two further acquisitions during the year to bolster its realtime reservoir management suite of services in january schlumberger acquired norwegianbased inside reality as providing new 3d virtual reality systems that create a unique and powerful environment for interactive well planning and realtime geosteering analysis schlumberger also acquired the software and services business of technoguide as a leader in the reservoir modeling domain

revenue for 2003 was 12 billion versus 15 billion in 2002 reflecting a 20 decrease yearonyear this was primarily due to lower land crew activity following the exiting of the north american land market combined with the completion of some contracts in the middle east the decrease in revenue was also due to declines in multiclient sales principally in north  south america partially offset by increased marine activity in europe caspian and the middle east qmarine continued to gain customer acceptance with 75 vessel utilization on third party contracts in the third quarter and the first qonq time lapse survey which was performed in the north sea with initial processing results available after 11 days the end of the year saw a return to traditional seasonal multiclient revenue levels partially helped by the signing of a longterm business agreement with a major energy company that included the licensing of part of the westerngeco data library as well as joint rd and training on new technology for seismic data processing 

including multiclient precommitments the backlog at the end of 2003 reached 408 million reflecting the award of a number of land contracts in the middle east and a material multiclient volume agreement signed in the fourth quarter during 2003 qmarine continued to command significant pricing premiums as a result of the added value obtained from the delivered product but pricing across other business segments was flat to down for conventional marine land and data processing activity due to continued overcapacity in the industry the company’s decision to acquire only significantly prefunded multiclient surveys along with lower amortization following the impairment charge in 2003 resulted in the multiclient product line being in a much healthier condition at the end of the year qmarine penetration continued strong reflected by the doubling of q revenue yearonyear 

pretax operating loss was 20 million versus a profit of 71 million in 2002 excluding multiclient impairment and other charges in both years mainly due to significantly higher multiclient amortization charges as a result of lower sales and a more conservative amortization policy in light of business conditions the lower multiclient sales were primarily due to an overall lessening in interest in the gulf of mexico from

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

schlumberger’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon schlumberger’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires schlumberger to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

on an ongoing basis schlumberger evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts valuation of inventories and investments recoverability of longlived assets income tax provision and deferred taxes profit assumptions on longterm percentageofcompletion contracts contingencies and litigation and actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

schlumberger believes the critical accounting policies described below affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

schlumberger recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on longterm fixed price contracts using the percentageofcompletion method which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs schlumberger follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion revisions in profit estimates are charged or credited to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known as a change in estimate losses on longterm contracts are provided for when such losses are known and reasonably estimated 

schlumberger recognizes revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured whether the fee is fixed and determinable is assessed based on the payment terms associated with the transaction collection is assessed based on a number of factors including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 

revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements such as those including installation and integration services are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element and when the delivered elements have stand alone value to the customers 

for sales either a binding purchase order signed license agreement or a written contract is used as evidence of an arrangement 

revenue from maintenance services is recognized ratably over the contract term the training and consulting services time and materials are billed based on hourly rates and revenue is generally recognized as these services are performed revenue from outsourcing services is generally recognized as services are performed 

the westerngeco segment capitalizes the cost associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data such costs are charged to cost of goods sold and services based on a percentage of estimated total revenue that schlumberger estimates that it will receive from the sales of such data the carrying value of individual surveys is reviewed at least annually and adjustments to the value are made based upon the revised estimated revenues for the surveys 

schlumberger maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

   

part ii item 7 

  

schlumberger writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

schlumberger assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and related goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

when schlumberger determines that the carrying value of intangibles longlived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment any impairment is measured based on projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset including eventual disposition 

schlumberger had net deferred tax assets of 632 million at december 31 2003 which excluded 325 million relating to a certain european net operating loss for which there is a valuation allowance in assessing the need for valuation allowances schlumberger considers the probable likelihood of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 

with regard to pension and postretirement benefits schlumberger evaluates the appropriateness of assumptions used by an independent actuary in particular assumptions as to discount rate return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates the assumptions are revised at least annually as circumstances require 

  

cash flow 

  

in 2003 cash provided by operations was 211 billion as net income plus depreciationamortization and net charges including the extinguishment of european debt and multiclient and vessel impairments were only partially offset by increases in customer receivables due to higher revenue and decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities cash used in investing activities was 149 billion and included investments in fixed assets 103 billion and multiclient seismic data 150 million the purchase of shortterm investments 115 billion the net proceeds 106 million from the sale of schlumberger’s investment of 97 million shares in grant prideco inc the proceeds from the sales of nptest 220 million and ecity 79 million activities and the net proceeds 177 million from the sale of the hanover compressor note cash used by financing activities was 558 million with the proceeds from employee stock plans 172 million offset by the payment of dividends to shareholders 437 million the costs related to the extinguishment of certain european debt 168 million and an overall reduction in debt of 126 million 

  

   

part ii item 7 

  

“net debt” is gross debt less cash shortterm investments and fixed income investments held to maturity management believes that net debt provides useful information regarding the level of schlumberger’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt and that the level of net debt provides useful information as to the results of schlumberger’s deleveraging efforts details of the net debt follows 

  

    

   

at december 31 2003 the cash and shortterm investments of 31 billion and the remaining facilities of 26 billion are sufficient to meet future business requirements 

based on forecast 2004 net income depreciationamortization estimates cash from the sale of schlumbergersema 550 million and atos origin stock 625 million and other possible business and asset divestitures and other cash flow components schlumberger expects to improve cash flow with an objective of reducing the net debt to 3 billion by midyear and 2 billion by yearend 2004 this will largely be dependent upon the business segments operating results and the successful completion of certain business divestitures 

in addition schlumberger is currently reviewing the feasibility and cost of a buyback of all or a portion of the remaining european longterm debt and the continued appropriateness of maintaining the effectiveness of its us interest rate derivative a buyback of the debt and the interest rate derivative becoming ineffective would result in a charge to income from continuing operations in 2004

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

schlumberger does not believe it has a material exposure to interest rate and currency market risks schlumberger manages the exposure to interest rate changes by using a mix of debt maturities and variable and fixedrate debt together with interest rate swaps where appropriate to fix or lower borrowing costs with regard to foreign currency fluctuations schlumberger enters into various contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions in foreign currencies schlumberger does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 

with respect to equity market risks schlumberger’s investment portfolio includes equity investments in publicly held companies that are classified as availableforsale or restricted from sale and other strategic equity holdings in privately held companies these securities are exposed to price fluctuations as of december 31 2003 the carrying value of the availableforsale and restricted equity securities was 92 million december 31 2002 283 million 

the process of determining the fair values of the privately held equity investments inherently requires certain assumptions and subjective judgments these valuation assumptions and judgments include

schlumberger invented wireline logging in 1927 as a technique for obtaining downhole data in oil and gas wells today schlumberger oilfield services operates in each of the major oilfield service markets covering the entire life cycle of the reservoir these services are organized into seven technology segments in which schlumberger holds a number of market leading positions to capitalize on technical synergies and introduce innovative solutions within the geomarket regions

schlumberger also owns several jack up rigs two of which were sold in the fourth quarter of 2002 in addition the reed hycalog drillbits business was sold to grant prideco in december 2002 and has been treated as a discontinued operation 

  

schlumberger’s oilfield services are marketed by its own personnel the customer base business risks and opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all services there is a sharing of manufacturing and engineering facilities as well as research centers labor force is interchangeable technological innovation quality of service and price are the principal methods of competition competition varies geographically with respect to the different services offered while there are numerous competitors both large and small schlumberger believes that it is an industry leader in providing seismic services measurementswhiledrilling and loggingwhiledrilling services and fully computerized logging and geoscience software and computing services land and marine seismic operations and technologies are managed and developed by westerngeco a large proportion of schlumberger’s oilfield services are nonrig related consequently revenue does not necessarily correlate to rig count fluctuations 

  

the focus of schlumberger oilfield services is on increasing the productivity of oil and gas reservoirs which is being enhanced through the delivery and application of realtime data as oil and gas operators face declining production and challenges in adding new reserves economically they are increasing their focus on improving recovery rates from existing and new reserves while reducing overall costs as a result the longterm objective is to fully integrate schlumbergersema it solutions and services with oilfield operations to provide realtime reservoir management services that allow customers to optimize production and the recovery of their hydrocarbon reserves

2002 results 

  

revenue for 2002 was 93 billion versus 99 billion in 2001 reflecting a 5 decrease due to reduced activity in north america and latin america which were 24 and 7 lower respectively this was partially mitigated by higher activity in europeciswest africa up 14 and the middle east  asia where revenue increased 10 the mi rig count fell 17 pretax operating income decreased 26 primarily from reduced margins in wireline well services and seismic technologies as activity declined in north america 

  

a sharp fall in revenue at the beginning of 2002 reflected declining activity levels in north america which remained depressed for the remainder of the year together with political and economic uncertainty in latin america in the second and third quarters robust activity in europeciswest africa and signs of a possible recovery in asia mitigated the effects of low north american drilling levels resulting in increased revenues however this trend was shortlived as slower activity outside north america due mainly to seasonal influences coupled with budget cuts resulted in lower fourth quarter revenues in 2002 the caspian russia and mexico geomarkets posted the highest doubledigit revenue growth of 89 62 and 48 respectively versus 2001 

  

from a technology standpoint the strongest performer was well completions  productivity where acquisitions testing advanced completions systems and artificial lift technology market share gains resulted in 8 revenue growth during the year schlumberger acquired a comeau  associates a leading provider of electrical engineering products and services for artificially lifted wells this latest addition combined with the successful integration of sensa and phoenix technologies into the schlumberger artificial lift services portfolio contributed to higher sales in 2002 particularly in the eastern hemisphere the drilling  measurements technology segment also recorded solid revenue growth of 7 fuelled largely by the continued penetration of the powerdrive475 rotary steerable system into new geomarkets 

  

in addition to a comeau  associates limited schlumberger made two further acquisitions during the year to bolster its realtime reservoir management suite of services in january schlumberger acquired norwegianbased inside reality as providing new 3d virtual reality systems that create a unique and powerful environment for interactive well planning and realtime geosteering analysis schlumberger also acquired the software and services business of technoguide as a leader in the reservoir modeling domain 

  

the seismic downturn continued throughout 2002 resulting in significantly lower activity levels a reduction in multiclient license sales and extreme pricing pressures for westerngeco as a result schlumberger announced operating losses in the third quarter related to contracts in india and mexico and in the fourth quarter workforce reductions of 1700 people coupled with the closure of its landbased seismic operations in the us lower 48 states and canada westerngeco revenue of 15 billion decreased 13 and pretax operating income of 71 million fell 68 

  

north america 

  

north america revenue of 28 billion decreased 24 versus 2001 while the mi rig count dropped 27 

  

a steep revenue decline at the outset of the year reflected a continued lackluster drilling environment and unseasonably mild weather conditions throughout the remainder of the year activity levels remained depressed resulting in essentially flat revenue for 2002 other factors contributing to reduced revenues included lower nonrig related activity resulting in lower wireline well services and well completions  productivity revenues the effects of the tropical storms in the third quarter a slow pickup in canadian activity post spring breakup and the previously stated closure of us landbased and canadian seismic operations 

  

pretax operating income of 409 million decreased 52 due to pricing pressures across all services particularly in well services well completions  productivity and seismic services 

  

westerngeco revenue of 548 million and pretax operating income of 131 million fell 36 and 40 respectively 

  

latin america 

  

latin america revenue of 15 billion decreased 7 versus 2001 while the mi rig count decreased 20 

  

ongoing political and economic uncertainty in the region continued to affect business conditions particularly in venezuela and argentina this particularly impacted results in the first half of the year in sharp contrast the second half of 2002 saw solid growth partly as a result of higher demand for drilling  measurements and well completions technologies connected to contracts in the burgos basin in addition the completion of an ipm project that involved the sale of production facilities in ecuador for 265 million in the fourth quarter contributed to endofyear higher revenue 

  

pretax operating income of 175 million declined 13 as a result of decreased activity in venezuela and argentina 

  

westerngeco revenue of 169 million increased 25 however pretax operating income of 49 million dropped 71 due to the recognition of land seismic contract losses in mexico in the third quarter 

  

europeciswest africa 

  

europeciswest africa revenue of 27 billion increased 14 versus 2001 as the mi rig count decreased 5 

  

strong revenue growth was recorded in the first three quarters reflecting increased activity levels and market share gains particularly in the caspian and russia geomarkets in respect to artificial lift and drilling technologies the well completions  productivity technology segment recorded the strongest growth of 27 followed by drilling  measurements which grew 24 

  

  

this growth was partially mitigated by a steep revenue drop in the fourth quarter due to exceptionally severe winter weather conditions in the north sea and russia that affected all services particularly seismic and fracturing activities in addition operator budget cuts in the nigeria geomarket and refocused investment decisions in the uk contributed to lower fourth quarter revenues 

  

pretax operating income of 322 million decreased 6 due to softening in pricing towards the end of the year and restructuring in the region to reduce support infrastructure to match slowing activity levels 

  

westerngeco revenue of 267 million decreased 5 and the pretax operating loss of 52 million was 67 higher than 2001 

  

middle east  asia 

  

middle east  asia revenue of 24 billion increased 10 outpacing the mi rig count which grew 6 for the same period 

  

after a decline at the beginning of the year resulting from exceptional artificial lift sales at the end of 2001 the asian market showed signs of recovery highlighted by strong revenue growth in the second quarter over the year the india and malaysiabruneiphilippines geomarkets recorded the strongest growth due to increased activity in these countries in addition the wireline and well services technology segments posted the highest growth up 14 and 10 respectively 

  

this was partly offset however by a slowdown in activity in the second half of 2002 due to a number of major projects nearing completion lower equipment sales and a significant reduction in seismic activity throughout the area 

  

pretax operating income of 457 million was flat despite the revenue growth due to marine seismic contract losses incurred in india in the third quarter coupled with softening pricing in well completions and productivity services 

  

westerngeco revenue of 490 million increased 15 however pretax operating income of 32 million declined 93 due to the recognition of marine seismic contract losses in india 

  

2001 results 

  

record oilfield services operating revenue of 99 billion increased 36 over 2000 in sharp contrast with the worldwide mi rig count which grew only 15 increased nonrig related activity partly attributable to the westerngeco joint venture and higher pricing levels contributed to the growth 

  

operating revenue started to grow in the first quarter due to continued high activity in north america and increased demand internationally the latter continued throughout 2001 and was reflected in the europeciswest africa and middle east  asia area results however softening north american drilling activity in the third quarter as a result of slower economic growth and declining natural gas drilling activity offset international growth 

  

the westerngeco joint venture in its first full financial reporting year was the largest contributor to doubledigit growth in all areas with the malaysiabruneiphilippines alaska gulf coast and west  south africa geomarkets recording the strongest results versus 2000 market share gains improved pricing levels and the introduction of new technology contributed to strong growth in the drilling  measurements technology business in addition improved reda submersible pump sales and the continued expansion of the powerstim well production optimization solution contributed to significant growth in the well completions  productivity technology segment 

  

2001 was a significant year as oilfield services acquired several key technologies as part of its continuing focus to build a complete suite of realtime reservoir optimization services in april 2001 schlumberger acquired baker jardine a leading provider of software tools it consulting and integrated solutions that help operators increase oil and gas production secondly a unique distributing temperature sensing technique was added to the schlumberger realtime offering through the acquisition of sensa the 

  

recognized leader in fiber optic sensing technologies sensa provides operators with a continuous measurement for the monitoring of producing wells thirdly schlumberger acquired phoenix a leading provider of technologies and techniques for optimizing production from artificially lifted wells in october 2001 

  

north america 

  

north american operating revenue increased 49 versus 2000 outpacing the mi rig count which grew 17 the strong operating revenue growth that continued in the first quarter of 2001 plateaued in the middle of the year this was due to slower economic conditions and declining natural gas prices which resulted in reduced activity towards the end of the year the alaska and gulf coast geomarkets recorded the strongest revenue growth due to increased demand for drilling and measurements and well services wireline technologies and higher seismic activity 

  

pretax operating income increased 124 particularly due to strong demand for well services technologies and the significant impact of the westerngeco joint venture 

  

latin america 

  

operating revenue increased 32 exceeding the mi rig count growth of 13 increased activity across all services contributed to doubledigit growth in the geomarkets growth was led by the perucolombiaecuador and latin america south geomarkets as a result of increased drilling and measurements and well services further higher well completions services during the year and an increase in land seismic activity in bolivia during the fourth quarter contributed to growth in these geomarkets 

  

pretax operating income increased 133 principally as a result of increases in ipm wireline and the impact of the westerngeco joint venture 

  

europeciswest africa 

  

operating revenue increased 41 in the europeciswest africa area more than double the mi rig count growth which rose 15 overall moderate growth was recorded for the year led by high demand for well completions services in nigeria and strong growth in drilling and measurements and wireline services in the russia geomarket in particular strong growth was seen in the west and south africa geomarket partly due to an early production facility project for ipm during the year 

  

pretax operating income increased 59 due mainly to the well completions  productivity segment which recorded strong growth across most geomarkets 

  

middle east  asia 

  

a 26 increase in operating revenue surpassed the mi rig count fourfold in 2001 almost all geomarkets in the region recorded strong doubledigit growth led by seismic drilling and measurements and well services activities in the malaysia brunei and philippines geomarket and as a result of new contract wins in the gulf geomarket moderate sequential growth was recorded throughout the year reflecting the pick up in international activity 

  

pretax operating income increased 50 comprised mostly of an increase in drilling  measurements and in the well completions  productivity technology segments 

  

2000 results 

  

moderate growth was recorded during the first half of the year with sharp sequential growth in the second half of the year led by increased activity in north america and higher demand for drilling  measurements technologies up 29 and well services up 25 the seismic down cycle which started at the beginning of 1999 continued through the first half of the year the second half of 2000 saw significant improvement leading to higher schlumberger activity due to the introduction of new generation seismic q marine technology and increased multiclient data sales 

  

  

oilfield services operating revenue increased 20 compared with 1999 as the worldwide mi rig count grew 30 

  

north america 

  

north america operating revenue increased 46 versus 1999 in line with the mi rig count which grew 47 increased activity which started in the third quarter of 1999 continued into the beginning of 2000 with a significant increase in drilling activity due to the continued shift to natural gas exploration and development well services posted the strongest revenue growth up 56 followed by drilling  measurements up 46 and wireline which increased 40 pretax operating income increased 233 

  

latin america 

  

latin america operating revenue increased 23 for the year consistent with a 23 increase in the mi rig count there was strong growth in the second half of 2000 across most technology segments pretax operating segment income increased 390 due to improved profitability led by drilling  measurements and well services 

  

europeciswest africa 

  

operating revenue increased 7 in europeciswest africa during 2000 consistent with a 10 increase in the mi rig count results in the first quarter were lower year over year due to continued flat activity and a sharp decline in seismic activity in this region for the same period the increase in activity in the second half of the year was moderate compared with the other areas pretax operating income increased 86 as a result of increased pricing for wireline and drilling  measurements technologies 

  

middle east  asia 

  

operating revenue in middle east  asia increased 5 in line with a 5 increase in the mi rig count lower first quarter results resulted from the continued industry down cycle and the growth was moderate for the remainder of the year due to a slow increase in activity stronger sequential growth in the second half of the year resulted from increased activity in the middle east and improved demand particularly for drilling  measurements and testing technologies pretax operating income increased 3 

  

schlumbergersema 

  

2002 results 

  

schlumbergersema operating revenue increased 32 compared with 2001 mainly due to the acquisition of sema plc whose results were consolidated with effect from april 1 2001 on a proforma basis assuming the acquisition occurred on january 1 2001 operating revenue in 2002 was up 7 compared to 2001 the pretax segment income of 34 million compared to a loss of 33 million in 2001 reflecting the cost reductions initiatives implemented since the integration of sema plc into schlumberger the 2002 pretax segment income excludes the charges discussed on pages 2324 of this report 

  

in december an updated strategy for schlumbergersema was announced the schlumbergersema focus is now on it consulting and systems integration together with network and infrastructure solutions primarily in global energy while continuing to develop specific regional market sectors in areas where it has a successful competitive position based on scale and domain knowledge this strategy is designed to create industry leadership in the energy market by combining the systems integration skills of sema with the global reach and energy sector knowledge of schlumberger 

  

  

schlumbergersema won the top prize at the prestigious management consultancies association mca best management practice awards in london for its work on the 2002 salt lake city olympic winter games at the 2002 winter olympic games schlumbergersema led a consortium of 15 technology partners in a threeyear long project to deliver the it infrastructure needed to run the games dr jacques rogge president of the international olympic committee commented “the information technology operations of any olympic games play a vital role in the overall success of the games” schlumberger is also the official worldwide information technology partner for the olympic games in 2004 2006 and 2008 

  

north  south america 

  

operating revenue increased 4 over 2001 primarily due to increased activity from the network infrastructure solutions nis business as a result of several large it outsourcing projects these include the conoco and dallas county it projects and the dexanet global connectivity solution to provide communications for houstonbased atwood oceanics offshore and land facilities around the world partially offsetting the increase in activity from nis revenue declined in the telecom and utility industries due primarily to the weak it services spending environment as customers faced economic challenges and continued to revise budgets downwards and delay decisions on contract awards however major contracts have been awarded in the energy segment such as the online energy management system for aes infoenergy in brazil and the systems integration and data management services contracts with nebraska public power district nppd of columbus nebraska 

  

despite the marginal increase in revenue pretax operating loss of 43 million represented an improvement of 18 over 2001 mainly attributable to the cost reduction programs implemented throughout the area 

  

europemiddle eastafrica 

  

operating revenue increased 35 mainly due to the inclusion of a full year’s revenue from the acquisition of sema plc compared to nine months in 2001 on a comparable basis the revenue increased by 4 despite a declining it services market in europe for the first time since 1993 the main contributor to the growth was the public sector mainly in the uk where schlumbergersema won large outsourcing contracts with the association of train operating companies the department of work and pension and the vehicle inspectorate also contributing to the improvements were an energyrelated project for brusselsbased electrabel sa a leading energy producer distributor and supplier in belgium with power plants in eight european countries serving about 45 million customers daily and a health and welfare services project to consignia’s 220000 employees in the uk 

  

pretax operating income increased 33 due mainly to the cost cutting program implemented throughout the year 

  

asia 

  

operating revenue increased 38 on a comparable basis operating revenue would have been flat the decreased activity in telecommunications mainly in china and taiwan was offset by the increase in the finance segment on new outsourcing contracts in the insurance sector in japan for mass mutual and delivery of payment systems in china 

  

pretax operating income decreased 61 mainly attributable to pricing pressure and economic declines in the telecommunications it services industry 

  

telecom products 

  

operating revenue increased 22 over 2001 principally due to the inclusion of sema plc on a comparable basis the activity was flat despite the sharp decline in the telecommunications industry during the year the focus was on streamlining the product portfolio and reducing the number of rd centers and reducing the workforce to the level of activity 

  

the pretax operating loss of 24 million was an improvement over the loss of 34 million in 2001 mainly due to the significant workforce reduction aimed at aligning rd with the product development cycles 

  

  

2001 results 

  

on april 6 2001 schlumberger completed the acquisition of sema plc for 515 billion sema plc is a leading it and technical services company with a strong european presence the acquisition was financed through existing cash resources of schlumberger and from borrowings under a 3 billion floating rate credit facility as a result of the acquisition the schlumbergersema business segment was created combining sema plc and certain businesses of schlumberger test  transactions and resource management services including cellnet and convergent 

  

operating revenue increased 20 billion over 2000 due to the acquisition of sema plc excluding the acquisition of sema plc the operating revenue increase would have been 383 million on a pro forma basis 

  

nis experienced a 91 operating revenue growth for 2001 versus 2000 mostly due to ep contracts demonstrating that this industry is recognizing the importance of it connectivity and security 

  

north  south america 

  

operating revenue increased 233 versus 2000 essentially due to the inclusion of the full year’s activity for the convergent group acquired in november 2000 and cellnet data systems acquired in june 2000 additionally the increased utilities activity was a result of strong demand for real time energy management systems rtems services and further deployment of related networks the extension of key existing utility business contracts in north america for utility data management services and the award of a significant contract for consulting and personal energy management advanced data services contributing to the growth was the award of nis projects by university of texas medical board shell and ecopetrol 

  

pretax operating loss was 22 lower than the previous year 

  

europemiddle eastafrica 

  

operating revenue increased significantly due to the inclusion of sema plc excluding sema plc the year on year pro forma operating revenue increase would have been 83 million due principally to the full inclusion of data marine systems limited acquired in october 2000 and to the award of multimillion dollar contracts in france for banque de france and in the uk for metropolitan police 

  

pretax operating income increased significantly due to the inclusion of sema plc 

  

asia 

  

operating revenue increased almost eightfold largely due to the integration of sema plc excluding sema plc the year on year growth would have been 24 million entirely due to stronger nis activity and to sustained demand for business continuity and outsourcing services throughout the area exemplified by the desktop outsourcing project for caltex in sumatra indonesia 

  

pretax operating income increased significantly due to the inclusion of sema plc 

  

telecom products 

  

there was no activity prior to 2001 

  

the activity was mainly led by strong bookings in mobile messaging systems with the first semaportal short message server implementation and customer care and billing products system integration for mobile operators such as the project awarded by telecom italia mobile tim which covers their operations in europe and brazil 

  

2000 results 

  

during the year schlumbergersema took strategic steps in the global energy segment to build its solutions offerings through the acquisition in june 2000 of cellnet data systems the leading provider of telemetry technology for the development and deployment of largescale automatic meter reading amr systems and the convergent group a leading builder of digital enterprises focusing on the utility sector in november 2000 

  

  

operating revenue increased 250 yearonyear reflecting the above two acquisitions and the acquisition of the remaining 50 stake in omnes a joint venture previously equally owned by schlumberger and cable  wireless 

  

north  south america 

  

operating revenue increased more than fourfold over 1999 due to market expansion including the acquisition of cellnet data systems and the convergent group the receipt of several major orders in real time energy management systems rtems and the university of texas medical board nis’ contract 

  

the pretax operating loss reflected the newly acquired cellnet and convergent activities 

  

europemiddle eastafrica 

  

operating revenue increased 158 and pretax operating income increased 37 due to the 50 consolidation of omnes and the full consolidation of data marine systems 

  

asia 

  

operating revenue increased 108 and pretax operating income increased 8fold entirely due to the consolidation of 100 of omnes into schlumberger 

  

telecom products 

  

there was no activity in telecom products during the year 2000 

  

other 

  

included in this segment are nptest consisting of the core product lines of schlumberger semiconductor solutions smart cards pointofsale terminals ecity terminals payphones payments systems electricity meters and the divested businesses of the former resource management services segment 

  

on may 21 2002 nptest filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for a proposed initial public offering of its shares of common stock which is not yet effective 

  

2002 results 

  

operating revenue decreased 32 reflecting the divestiture of the resource management services north american water metering activities and the nonnorth american electricity and water meter and worldwide gas meter businesses in november 2001 

  

nptest activity increased due to a partial recovery in test equipment sales in north america and asia partially offset by decreases in diagnostic equipment sales and equipment support services 

  

volume product activity remained flat despite the continuing slump in the telecommunications industry and the continued pricing pressure this was partially offset by higher activity in banking and it cards coupled with a favorable eurodollar exchange rate 

  

pretax operating income decreased 78 mainly due to the divestiture of resource management services and eroded profitability in the smart cards business 

  

2001 results 

  

operating revenue decreased 13 reflecting mainly the divestiture of the resource management services businesses which were sold in november 2001 and the decline in semiconductor activity which followed the down cycle in the worldwide semiconductor industry 

  

  

volume products operating revenue grew by 13 despite a slowdown in the telecommunications industry smart cards operating revenue increased 9 compared with 2000 

  

nptest revenue decreased approximately 47 from the prior year due to the sharp decline in the industry with all product lines affected 

  

pretax operating income decreased 40 due mainly to pricing pressure in both the semiconductor and the smart cards industries 

  

2000 results 

  

operating revenue was flat increased activity in the smart cards business driven by outstanding growth of the mobile communications market and in nptest up 5 was offset by the decline in resource management services down 16 where pressure on utility prices resulted in a continued downturn for the utility industry 

  

pretax operating income grew 49 yearonyear mainly attributable to the improved profitability in smart cards 

  

  

income – continuing operations 

  

        

in 2002 oilfield services segment net income decreased 267 million or 21 to 987 million as revenue declined 5 compared to the worldwide mi rig count reduction of 17 north america registered the most significant decline as revenue decreased 24 on a mi rig count reduction of 27 schlumbergersema segment net income of 21 million improved from a loss of 22 million in 2001 reflecting the revenue increase of 32 7 on a proforma basis – assuming the sema plc acquisition took place on january 1 2001 and the effect of the previously announced cost reduction program in the other segment net income declined to 14 million from 85 million in 2001 which included the divested resource management services businesses 

  

in 2001 oilfield services segment net income increased 498 million or 66 to 1254 million reflecting the 36 growth in revenue which outpaced the 15 increase in the worldwide mi rig count higher pricing levels and increased nonrig related activity were the major factors attributable to the record oilfield services revenues schlumbergersema segment net loss of 22 million improved 19 million reflecting the incremental income from the newly acquired sema plc in the other segment net income of 85 million declined 34 million from the prior year with declines in the semiconductorrelated and cards activities 

  

in 2000 oilfield services segment net income increased 328 million or 76 to 756 million increases in ep expenditures and in oil and gas prices resulting from increased oil demand and the lowest level of excess oil production capacity in decades were the underlying factors of the strong increases in most areas and notably in north america average worldwide rig count increased 30 compared to 1999 schlumbergersema segment net loss of 41 million was down 43 million due to losses in the newly acquired cellnet and convergent businesses in north america in the other segment net income of 119 million increased 32 million from the prior year mainly due to stronger results from the cards activity where revenue was up 26 

  

currency risks 

  

refer to page 39 translation of nonus currencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for a description of the schlumberger policy on currency hedging there are no material unhedged assets liabilities or commitments which are denominated in other than a business’ functional currency schlumberger businesses operate principally in us dollars the euro and most other european currencies and most south american currencies 

  

while changes in exchange rates affect revenue especially in the schlumbergersema segment they also affect costs generally speaking schlumberger is currency neutral for example a 5 change in average 

  

exchange rates of oecd currencies would have had no material effect on consolidated revenue and net income 

  

in general when the us dollar weakens against other currencies consolidated revenue increases usually with no material effect on net income this is principally because the fallthrough incremental margin in the schlumbergersema segment offsets the higher oilfield services segment nonus dollar denominated expenses 

  

research  engineering 

  

expenditures by business segment were as follows 

  

    

interest expense 

  

interest expense decreased 17 million to 368 million mainly due to a decrease in average borrowing rates from 58 to 49 the increase in 2001 of 109 million to 385 million was principally due to the significantly higher debt balances incurred relating to the acquisition of sema plc which were only partially offset by a reduction in average borrowing rate from 69 to 58 the increase in 2000 of 83 million to 276 million was mainly due to an increase in average borrowing rates from 58 to 69 

  

hanover compressor transaction 

  

in august 2001 schlumberger sold its oilfield services worldwide gas compression activity to hanover compressor company the proceeds included common stock of hanover compressor with a value at closing of 173 million which is restricted from marketability until august 30 2004 and a 150 million longterm subordinated note maturing december 15 2005 

  

the market value of schlumberger’s investment in hanover compressor common stock was 80 million as of december 31 2002 following the decline in the market value of the stock below carrying value during the second quarter of 2002 schlumberger has performed and continues to perform a periodic assessment in accordance with its policy to determine whether an otherthantemporary decline in fair value has occurred schlumberger evaluated the recoverability of its investment by reviewing recent information related to the industry and the operating results and financial position of hanover compressor and by considering schlumberger’s requirement ability and intent to hold the investment on a longterm basis schlumberger concluded that evidence existed at december 31 2002 to support the recoverability of its carrying value that there were no events or changes in circumstances specifically relating to the business prospects of hanover compressor that the underlying business fundamentals are good with natural gas supplies reduced and higher natural gas prices in north america in addition the recently announced hanover cutbacks in workforce and capital expenditures coupled with no immediate debt maturities should provide adequate capital resources in the nearterm accordingly schlumberger concluded that the decline in market value of its investment 93 million in hanover compressor as of december 31 2002 was temporary in nature and has not reduced the cost basis of that investment if the decline in value persists or should schlumberger’s assessment change schlumberger would take a charge to its earnings for the amount that is deemed unrecoverable 

  

the 150 million longterm subordinated note has a mandatory prepayment upon the issuance sale or other disposition by hanover compressor of any shares of capital stock or other equity interests pursuant to a 

  

public offering or a private placement otherwise prepayment is discretionary as of december 31 2002 schlumberger considers the carrying value of the note to be fully collectible 

  

as part of the sale agreement schlumberger agreed that the financing of the pigap ii joint venture in venezuela would be nonrecourse to the buyer and would be executed prior to december 31 2002 accordingly schlumberger was obligated with respect to the financing to guarantee 30 approximately 80 million until the project was completed in 2002 and if as of december 31 2002 refinancing had not become nonrecourse to the buyer or the project had not achieved substantial completion hanover compressor had an option to put its interest in the joint venture back to schlumberger 

  

as an outcome of the turmoil in venezuela although the project reached substantial completion the nonrecourse financing for the project was not achieved by december 31 2002 on january 30 2003 hanover compressor gave notice of its intention to exercise its right to put its ownership interest in the joint venture back to schlumberger the put is subject to certain consents and other conditions schlumberger’s obligation to provide a guarantee with respect to the financing was eliminated 

  

as schlumberger originally deferred the gain on the sale of the joint venture in 2001 there is no impact on schlumberger results of operations due to the hanover compressor exercise of its option 

  

charges – continuing operations 

  

schlumberger recorded the following aftertax and minority interest chargescredits for continuing operations in 2002 2001 and 2000 

  

   

schlumberger recorded severance facility and other costs in an effort to reduce costs at schlumbergersema and westerngeco these costs related to expenses that offer no future benefit to the ongoing operations of these businesses during the fourth quarter schlumberger also recorded an impairment charge to reflect a change in the business projections of the westerngeco business related to capitalized multiclient seismic library costs a deferred tax valuation allowance and other costs 

  

the total of the above charges was 3168 million and consisted of 1 a goodwill impairment charge of 2638 million 2 an intangible assets impairment charge of 132 million 3 schlumbergersema severance and other charges of 77 million in response to current business conditions 4 westerngeco severance and other charges of 72 million in response to current business conditions 5 a westerngeco multiclient library impairment charge of 129 million following a valuation of the library 6 environmental related charges of 26 million 7 a deferred tax valuation allowance charge of 94 million 

  

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

an analysis of the december 2002 pretax severance and facility charges is as follows 

  

   

the remaining severance costs are expected to be paid before september 30 2003 

  

the december 2001 charge included severance costs of 41 million 775 people which have been paid 

  

the december 2000 charges included severance costs of 9 million 380 people which have been paid 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

schlumberger’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon schlumberger’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires schlumberger to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

  

on an ongoing basis schlumberger evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts valuation of inventories and investments recoverability of longlived assets income tax provision and deferred taxes profit assumptions on longterm percentageofcompletion contracts contingencies and litigation and actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

schlumberger believes the critical accounting policies described below affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

  

schlumberger recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on longterm fixed price contracts using the percentageofcompletion method which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs schlumberger follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion revisions in profit estimates are charged or credited to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known as a change in estimate losses on longterm contracts are provided for when such losses are known and reasonably estimated 

  

schlumberger recognizes revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured whether the fee is fixed and determinable is assessed based on the payment terms associated with the transaction collection is assessed based on a number of factors including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 

  

revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements such as those including installation and integration services are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element and when there are no undelivered elements that are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements 

  

for sales either a binding purchase order signed license agreement or a written contract is used as evidence of an arrangement 

  

revenue from maintenance services is recognized ratably over the contract term the training and consulting services time and materials are billed based on hourly rates and revenue is generally recognized as these services are performed revenue from outsourcing services is generally recognized as services are performed 

  

the oilfield services segment capitalizes the cost associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data such costs are charged to cost of goods sold and services based on a percentage of estimated total revenue that schlumberger estimates that it will receive from the sales of such data the carrying value of individual surveys is reviewed at least annually and adjustments to the value are made based upon the revised estimated revenues for the surveys 

  

schlumberger maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

schlumberger writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

  

schlumberger assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and related goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following 

  

      

  

when schlumberger determines that the carrying value of intangibles longlived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment any impairment is measured based on projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset including eventual disposition 

  

schlumberger has net deferred tax assets of 583 million at december 31 2002 schlumberger considers future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances in december 2002 in connection with the schlumbergersema strategic review schlumberger determined that it would not be able to realize a part of its october 1 2002 net deferred asset in the future relating to a certain european net operating loss a valuation allowance of 94 million was charged to income in the fourth quarter the cumulative valuation allowance relating to this european net operating loss is approximately 147 million at december 31 2002 

  

with regard to pension and postretirement benefits schlumberger evaluates the appropriateness of assumptions used by an independent actuary in particular assumptions as to discount rate return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates the assumptions are revised at least annually as circumstances require 

  

  

liquidity 

  

a measure of financial position is liquidity which schlumberger defines as cash plus shortterm and fixed income investments less debt negative liquidity indicates net debt the following table summarizes the change in consolidated liquidity for each of the past three years 

  

     

at december 31 2002 schlumberger’s liquidity was negative debt exceeded cash plus investments at december 31 2002 schlumberger had cashshortterm investments of 17 billion and remaining capacity in debt facilities of 37 billion which are sufficient to meet future business requirements 

  

based on forecast 2003 net income depreciationamortization estimates and other liquidity components schlumberger expects to improve liquidity with an objective of reducing the net debt to under 4 billion by year end 2003 this will largely be dependent upon the business segments operating results and the successful completion of certain business divestitures 

  

  

acquisition of sema plc 

  

on february 12 2001 schlumberger announced that it had reached an agreement with the board of directors of sema plc on the terms of a recommended offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of sema plc 

  

on march 8 2001 a wholly owned subsidiary of schlumberger acquired through market purchases approximately 20 of the issued share capital of sema at a cost of 1 billion 

  

on april 6 2001 the offer for the shares of sema plc was declared unconditional in all respects the aggregate consideration for the acquisition of 100 of the issued sema shares was 515 billion including expenses of the transaction which was financed from existing cash resources and borrowings under a 3 billion credit facility 

  

on october 3 2001 wholly owned subsidiaries of schlumberger issued 19 billion european bonds euro 14 billion and £425 million the average interest rate of these bonds is 59 with maturity from 2008 through 2032 the proceeds from the issues were used to repay shortterm bank loans originally taken out by those subsidiaries to finance the acquisition of sema plc 

  

the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the goodwill and identifiable intangibles aggregated 519 billion which were being amortized on a straightline basis in 2001 effective january 1 2002 with the adoption of sfas 142 see new accounting standards  amortization of goodwill and workforce ceased identifiable intangibles continue to be amortized on a straightline basis over a life of 10 years 

  

the aggregate value of goodwill and identifiable intangibles comprised the following 

  

   

purchase accounting adjustments consisted primarily of severance costs 84 million – 1781 people facility reductions 33 million pension plan adjustments 136 million and tax restructuring costs 50 million at december 31 2001 26 million 593 people of the severance costs had been paid all remaining severance was paid in 2002 

  

for financial reporting purposes schlumberger included the results of operations of sema in its consolidated accounts commencing april 1 2001 if sema had been included in the consolidated financial statements of schlumberger from january 1 consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended december 31 2001 would have increased by 538 million to 143 billion and consolidated net income would have decreased by approximately 140 million to 382 million related primarily to increased interest expense amortization of intangibles and lower interest income on a proforma basis schlumberger 2000 operating revenue and net income would have been 12 billion and 300 million respectively
