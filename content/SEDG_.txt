our pv solar products offering 

 

solaredge began its commercial sales with a product offering of simplified inverters power optimizers and cloudbased monitoring platform as the solar energy industry has evolved solaredge has developed innovative solutions to further enhance smart energy technology including inverters that include compatibility with batteries for increased selfconsumption and storage inverters that allow ev charging smart meters smart energy devices sockets water heater controllers wireless relay and smart pv modules this product expansion has enabled us to increase average revenue per installation or arpi 

 

solaredge power optimizer   our dc power optimizer is a highly reliable and efficient dctodc converter which is connected by installers to each pv module or embedded by pv module manufacturers into their modules as part of the manufacturing process our power optimizer increases energy output from the pv module to which it is connected by continuously tracking the mpp of each module and controlling its working point the power optimizer’s ability to track the mpp of each pv module and its ability to increase or decrease its output voltage enables the inverter’s input voltage to remain fixed under a large variety of string configurations this feature enhances flexibility in pv system designs enabling use of different string lengths in a single pv system connected to the same inverter use of pv modules situated on multiple orientations connected to the same inverter and using varied pv module types in the same string in addition our power optimizers monitor the performance of each pv module and communicate this data to our inverter using our proprietary power line communication in turn the inverter transmits this information to our monitoring server each power optimizer is equipped with our proprietary safety mechanism which automatically reduces the output voltage of each pv module to 1 volt unless the power optimizer receives a failsafe signal from a functioning inverter as a result if the inverter is shut down eg for system maintenance due to malfunction in the event of a fire or otherwise the dc voltage throughout the system is reduced to a safe level 

  

our power optimizers are designed to withstand high temperatures and harsh environmental conditions and contain multiple bypass features that localize failures and enable continued system operation in the vast majority of cases of power optimizers failure our power optimizers are compatible with the vast majority of modules on the market today and carry a 25year product warranty our power optimizers are designed to be used with our inverters to provide power optimization monitoring and safety features can also be achieved with third party inverters by adding supplemental communications hardware during the year ended december 31 2019 the year ended december 31 2020 and the year ended december 31 2021 revenues derived from the sale of power optimizers represented 445 429 and 422 of total revenues respectively 

 

solaredge inverter   our dctoac inverters contain sophisticated digital control technology with efficient power conversion architecture resulting in superior solar power harvesting and high reliability and are designed to work exclusively with our dc power optimizers a proprietary power line communication receiver is integrated into each inverter receiving data from our power optimizers storing this data and transmitting it to our monitoring server when an internet connection exists since each string which is equipped with our power optimizers provides fixed input voltage to our inverter the inverter is able to operate at its highest efficiency at all times and therefore is more cost efficient energy efficient and reliable like our power optimizers our inverters are designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions since the power rating of an inverter determines how many pv modules it can serve larger installations require inverters with higher power ratings we currently offer a singlephase inverter designed to address the residential market 1 kilowatt “kw” to 114 kw which is based on our hdwave technology and a threephase inverter designed to address the residential market in certain european countries and australia as well as the commercial market 4 kw to 120 kw our singlephase inverters support a range of smart energy capabilities in 2020 we launched the solaredge energy hub inverter and home backup solution for the us residential market the solaredge energy hub inverter contains builtin consumption monitoring embedded revenuegrade production metering integrated arc fault protection rapid shutdown and is ready for a battery in 2021 we launched the new solaredge energy hub inverter models ranging from 76 kw up to 114 kw pv power and 103 kw backup power both the solaredge energy hub inverter and the solaredge energy bank battery described below are part of the new solaredge full residential solution the “solaredge home” an intelligent smart energy management system that allows homeowners to better manage and monitor solar energy production consumption and backup storage in real time our product offering also includes our commercial threephase 120kw inverter with synergy technology and enhanced power capabilities which is designed to enable quick and easy installation and inventory management for the commercial market the vast majority of our inverters are sold with a 12 year warranty that is extendable to 20 or 25 years for an additional cost during the year ended december 31 2019 the year ended december 31 2020 and the year ended december 31 2021 revenues derived from the sale of inverters represented 439 440 and 422 of total revenues respectively 

 

ev charging inverter solaredge’s ev charging inverter offers homeowners the ability to charge electric vehicles up to six times faster than a standard level 1 charger through an innovative solar boost mode that utilizes grid and pv charging simultaneously this inverter is the world’s first ev charger with an integrated pv inverter reducing the burden of installing separately a standalone ev charger and a pv inverter the ev charging inverter eliminates the need for additional wiring conduit and a breaker installation by installing an inverter that has an integrated ev charge no additional dedicated circuit breaker is needed saving space and eliminating the need for a potential upgrade to the main distribution panel 

 

storage solutions in 2021 we launched our residential battery the solaredge energy bank which is a 10 kw single phase battery that integrates with our solaredge energy hub family of inverters the solaredge energy bank battery provides homeowners the ability and the backup to power their homes even when the grid is off the battery also works in tandem with the solaredge energy management system to optimize the use of solar energy in places where the feed in tariffs are less favorable maximum selfconsumption the solaredge energy bank battery connects with the solaredge inverter through dccoupling which minimizes the number of dc to ac conversions which are typical in competing technologies saving energy and enabling higher efficiency the solution is based on a single inverter for both solar pv and storage to optimize selfconsumption the battery is charged and discharged to meet consumption needs and reduce the amount of power acquired from the grid with the solaredge backup solution unused solar pv power is stored in a battery and used during a power outage when a combination of solar pv power and battery is used to power important sources such as the refrigerator communication devices lighting and ac outlets our proprietary monitoring platform provides visibility into the batterys status solar pv production and selfconsumption while offering easy maintenance with remote access to inverter and battery software multiple batteries can be connected to a single solaredge energy hub inverter adding more available power to backup more significant loads such as airconditioners or refrigerators in addition solaredge inverters can be connected to third party batteries via the solaredge storedge solution where batteries can perform both maximum self consumption and backup functions 

 

some existing solaredge systems can be upgraded with a storage solution for both backup or ongrid maximum selfconsumption use 

 

solaredge software we offer a variety of professional software tools from system design to monitoring 

 

our “designer platform” is a free webbased tool that helps solar professionals plan build and validate our residential and commercial systems from inception to installation 

 

our “mapper app” provides solaredge installers with an efficient streamlined process for registering the physical layout of new pv sites in the solaredge monitoring platform installers use the mapper app to scan solaredge power optimizer and inverter barcodes creating a virtual map of the pv site in the monitoring platform to help facilitate remote diagnostics 

 

making installations quick and simple our “setapp” is used to activate and configure solaredge inverters during commissioning directly through a smartphone 

 

in 2021 we launched the mysolaredge application version 20 which enables system owners to easily track their realtime system production and household energy consumption view their inverter and battery status for quick troubleshooting and control the batterys backup capabilities all from the convenience of their mobile phones 

 

our cloudbased monitoring platform collects power voltage current and system data sent from our inverters and power optimizers and allows users to view the data at the module level string level inverter level and system level from most browsers or from most smart phones and tablets the monitoring software continuously analyzes data and flags potential problems the monitoring software includes features which are used on a routine basis by integrators installers maintenance staff and system owners to improve a solar pv system’s performance by maximizing solar power harvesting and reducing om costs by increasing system uptime and detecting pv module performance issues more effectively connection to the monitoring server is completed during installation by the installer the installer then receives full access to system data through the monitoring software and can select the amount of data to be shared with the system owner 

 

smart energy management there are two separate energy technology industries that exist today solar energy production and automation technology inverters are taking on an expanded role in energy management and automation andin order to address these market needs we are developing and providing automation products this line of products when used with the solaredge pv solution is designed to allow system owners to increase selfconsumption by shifting energy usage to match peak solar pv production as well as offer a convenient wireless control option over various building andor home devices an example of this solution would be using excess solar pv energy to heat water or the ability to remotely turn on or off certain power sources such as lighting or electrical appliances the introduction of these products is dependent upon certification and region specific needs and as such these products are not yet available in all of the geographies in which solaredge operates 

 

grid services as pv and storage continue to proliferate around the world energy production is transitioning from a centralized system to a distributed network model where energy is produced close to the location in which it is consumed and stored this model creates an opportunity for new interconnected and decentralized energy networks offering improved grid reliability and stability new energy services and reduction of grid infrastructure costs solaredge grid services deliver near realtime aggregative control and data reporting enabling the pooling of distributed energy resources — photovoltaic systems battery storage electric vehicle chargers and loads — in the cloud for the creation of virtual power plants vpp the solaredge grid services and vpp solution provides sophisticated management platforms to enable realtime aggregated control of available energy resources to meet everchanging supply needs and demand our distributed energy resources management system or derms application and application program interfaces apis are used by utilities for countering peak demand events in 2021 solaredge continued to generate revenues from selling grid services in the us europe and australia including services provided to independent system operators energy retailers national installers and others 

 

product roadmap

our technology 

 

we have drawn on our expertise in the fields of power electronics magnetic design mechanical and heat dissipation capabilities control loops and algorithms and power line communications to design and develop what we believe to be the most advanced commercial solutions for harvesting power from solar pv systems our advanced technologies are explained in more detail below 

 

as part of our growth strategy we have acquired companies that have technologies that can leverage our expertise in power electronics and power optimization by combining acquired resources with our current research and development teams we are expanding our activities into other essential areas such as emobility battery storage and energy storage systems 

 

power optimizers 

 

our power optimizers are dcdc step upstep down buck boost converters designed and developed to operate in harsh outdoor environments at very high conversion efficiency our power optimizers include proprietary power electronics customized to efficiently convert power from the pv module to the inverter the components are selected and the conversion topology is designed for the power optimizer specifications and the power optimizer design is verified for consistent performance and reliability in numerous lab tests and simulations 

 

a key factor in the performance of our power optimizer is determined by the digital control algorithms and closedloop control mechanism the power optimizer’s control is built into our advanced asic which is responsible for all critical digital control functions of the power optimizer including detailed power analysis digital control of the power conversion subsystem power line communications and networking since each power optimizer handles the power and voltage of a single module we are able to reach a high degree of semiconductor integration by leveraging low cost silicon in standard semiconductor packages as a result much of the functionality of our power optimizer can be integrated into a standard asic instead of use of discrete electronic components resulting in lower costs and higher reliability 

 

the asic performs the critical power analysis and power conversion control functions of the power optimizer the power analysis functions process the state and working parameters at the power optimizer’s input and output and together with advanced digital control and state machine logic control the power conversion function in addition our digital control system uses technology that allows the solar pv installation to anticipate and adapt to changing operating conditions and to protect itself against system anomalies in 2021 we incorporated our fourth generation asic in our new generation of power optimizers sseries in addition we added cable temperature monitoring functionality to this new generation of optimizers to improve their safety 

 

each power optimizer in the array is connected to the inverter by a power line communications networking link our power line communications link uses a proprietary networking technology that we developed utilizing the existing dc wiring between the power optimizers and the inverter to transmit and receive data between these devices 

 

inverters 

 

most of our inverters are designed for singlestage dcac conversion using our inverter in combination with the power optimizers allows the inverter control loop to maintain a regulated dc voltage level at its input thereby allowing for long uneven and multifaceted strings while also enabling custom cost efficient and reliable inverter design and component selection all of the power components as well as the main magnetic components for our inverters can then be optimized for dcac inversion at high efficiency 

 

our inverters’ digital control algorithms are implemented using programmable digital signal processors which allow for flexibility and adaptation of control loops for various grids and for the requirements and standards of different grid operators across geographies we have already implemented the control mechanisms necessary to support advanced grid codes and standards that are required to support high penetration of solar energy into utility grids we continue to develop and manufacture our own dsp asic in our inverters which enables us to improve our control loops increase our cost savings and be less dependent on third party suppliers in our manufacturing process the dsp asic performs the critical power analysis and power conversion control functions of the inverter the power analysis functions process the state and working parameters at the power inverter’s input and output and together with advanced digital control and state machine logic controls the power conversion function in addition our digital control system uses technology that allows the inverter to anticipate and adapt to changing operating conditions and to protect itself against system anomalies as well as comply with applicable regulations in the different regions in which we operate 

 

our dsp asic is also in charge of the power line communications plc networking link our plc uses a proprietary networking technology that we developed utilizing the existing dc wiring between the power optimizers and the inverter to transmit and receive data between these devices 

 

we have developed and continue to develop inhouse design and manufacturing capabilities for magnetic components in order to decrease dependence on suppliers reduce costs and have better control over our production processes 

 

batteries 

 

in 2021 we released our first lithiumion residential batteries for sale in the us and europe through our solar distribution channels our batteries are composed of lithium cells a battery management system bms bidirectional dcdc high efficiency converter that allows charge and discharge of the battery as well as user interface our dcdc converter uses digital control algorithms which are implemented using a programmable digital signal processor therefore both the battery and optimizers are connected to the same dc bus allowing the battery to be directly charged by the dc current generated by the optimizers and bypassing the ac conversion 

 

our efficient dccoupled battery is designed to connect with our singlephase inverters up to three batteries per inverter and provides 97 kwh of backup power our batteries can be connected to our cloud‑based monitoring platform reporting information on the battery status solar production and selfconsumption data 

 

manufacturing 

 

we have designed our manufacturing processes to produce high quality products at competitive costs the strategy is threefold outsource automate and localize we currently contract to have our solar products manufactured by two of the world’s leading global electronics manufacturing service providers jabil circuit inc “jabil” and flex industrial ltd “flex” by using contract manufacturers we are able to access advanced manufacturing equipment processes skills and capacity on a “capital light” budget our contract manufacturers are responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products except with regard to endofline testing equipment and other specific manufacturing equipment utilized in assembling our products or subcomponents which are financed and owned by the company we expect to continue this funding arrangement in the future with respect to any expansions to such existing lines further contracting with global providers such as jabil and flex gives us added flexibility to manufacture certain products in china and vietnam closer to target markets in asia and the north american west coast as well as other products in hungary closer to target markets in europe and the north american east coast in each case potentially increasing responsiveness to customers while reducing costs and delivery times in addition as part of our manufacturing regionalization efforts we are expanding our manufacturing capabilities with a new manufacturing site in mexico which is planned to start volume manufacturing during the second half of 2022 once ramped we believe this site will significantly increase our capacity and give us further flexibility to manage growing demand 

 

during 2021 we reached full manufacturing capacity in our manufacturing facility located in the north of israel “sella 1” from which we began commercial shipments to the us of optimizers and inverters in 2020 the proximity of sella 1 to our rd team and labs enables us to accelerate new product development cycles as well as define equipment and manufacturing processes of newly developed products which can then be adopted by our contract manufacturers worldwide 

 

we have developed propriety automated assembly lines for the manufacturing of our power optimizers these assembly lines currently operating in all of our manufacturing facilities enable the manufacturing of more than 5000 optimizers per machine per day we invest resources in additional automated assembly lines as well as in automated machinery for subassembly and selfmanufacturing of certain components used in our products and we own and are responsible for funding all of the capital expenses related thereto the current and expected capital expenses associated with these automated assembly lines and other machinery is funded out of our cash flows 

 

we source our raw materials through various component manufacturers and invest resources in continued costreduction efforts as well as verifying second and third sources so as to limit dependence on sole suppliers 

 

our korean subsidiary kokam has a manufacturing facility for lithiumion cells and batteries that has the capacity to manufacture up to 150 mwh per annum in 2020 we began construction of “sella 2” a 2gwh liion battery factory in korea the new factory is being constructed to meet the growing global demand for liion batteries specifically in the energy storage system ess and emobility markets sella 2 is expected to begin operation in the second half of 2022 

 

solaredge emobility has a manufacturing and assembly facility in umbertide italy for our emobility division furthermore during 2021 we began manufacturing a portion of our batteries for the solaredge emobility business in hungary 

 

reliability and quality control 

 

our power optimizers are either connected to each pv module by installers or embedded in each pv module by pv module manufacturers our power optimizers are designed to be as reliable as the pv module itself and capable of withstanding the same operating and environmental conditions 

 

our reliability methodology includes a multilevel plan with design analysis subsystem testing of critical components by accelerated life testing and integrative testing of design prototypes by highly accelerated life testing and large sample groups as part of our reliability efforts we subject components to industry standard conditions and tests including in accelerated life chambers that simulate burnin thermal cycling dampheat and other stresses we also conduct out of box audits oba on our finished products in addition online reliability tests ort are conducted on our optimizers and we test complete products in stress tests and in the field our rigorous testing processes have helped us to develop highly reliable products 

 

in order to verify the quality of each of our products when it leaves the manufacturing plant each component subassembly and final product are tested multiple times during production these tests include automatic optical inspection incircuit testing board functional testing safety testing and integrative stress testing we employ a serial numberdriven manufacturing process auditing and traceability system that allows us to control production line activities verify correct manufacturing processes and to achieve itemspecific traceability 

 

as a part of our quality and reliability approach failed products from the field are returned and subjected to root cause analysis the results of which are used to improve our product and manufacturing processes and design and further reduce our field failure rate

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies information processes and knowhow we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws in the us and similar laws in other countries confidentiality agreements and procedures and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology as of december 31 2021 solaredge had 405 issued patents worldwide and 397 patent applications pending for examination a majority of our patents relate to dc power optimization and dc to ac conversion for alternative energy power systems power system monitoring and control battery technology and management systems our issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2022 and 2039 

 

we continually assess opportunities to seek patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages 

 

we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we believe that many elements of our manufacturing processes involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes test equipment designs algorithms and procedures 

 

all of our research and development personnel are required to enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us 

 

our customers and business partners are required to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans 

 

competition 

 

the markets for our solar products are competitive and we compete with manufacturers of traditional inverters as well as manufacturers of other mlpe systems the principal areas in which we compete with other companies include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

recent market trends show an increased focus on safety features in rooftop installations and the emergence of standards that are evolving to address such concerns in particular the arc fault detection and interruption afdi and rapid shutdown rsd standards in the us market have led to the introduction of modulelevel rapidshutdown devices from our competitors we believe the existence of rapid shutdown capabilities built into our optimizers positions us well in this regard and could serve as a competitive advantage additionally in 2020 we have seen pv module manufacturers introduce larger pv modules with higher power levels reaching over 600w this market trend which comes as a result of pv cell manufacturers introducing larger cell sizes such as m10 and m12 as well as different module build configurations leads to market interest in higher power rating optimizers micro inverters and other mlpe devices the increasing demand for storage and battery solutions is an additional noteworthy market trend which is expected to increase the attachment rate of storage to pv installations in the coming years 

 

our dc optimized inverter system competes principally with products from traditional inverter manufacturers such as sma solar technology ag abb ltd and huawei technologies co ltd as well as from other chinese inverter manufacturers in the north american residential market we compete with traditional inverter manufacturers as well as microinverter manufacturers such as enphase energy inc in addition several new entrants to the mlpe market including lowcost asian manufacturers have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped similar products we believe that our dc optimized inverter system offers significant technology and cost advantages that reflect a competitive differentiation over traditional inverter systems and microinverter technologies 

 

the markets for our energy storage division products are competitive as well and we compete with global cell and battery manufacturers in the ess market our energy storage solutions compete with products from global manufactures such as lg energy solutions samsung sdi catl byd and panasonic 

 

our residential lithiumion batteries compete with global manufacturers of both lithiumion and other residential battery storage solutions such as tesla lg energy solutions byd and enphase energy 

 

in the ups market our ups products compete with products and solutions from global ups providers such as schneider electric eaton and vertiv 

 

the vehicle emobility component market is dominated primarily by manufacturers such as robert bosch gmbh zf friedrichshafen ag dana incorporated and magna international as the global emobility market expands major automotive manufacturers such as toyota honda tesla general motors and ford have increased their investments in the electric and hybrid vehicle components in order to increase their market share 

 

government incentives 

 

us federal state and local government bodies as well as nonus government bodies provide incentives to owners end users distributors and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates tax credits lower vat rate and other financial incentives such as system performance payments payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar pv systems from property tax assessments the market for on grid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of these government subsidies and economic incentives which vary from time to time by geographic market 

 

import tariffs 

 

escalating trade tensions between the united states and china have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions including tariffs applicable to some of our products as of june 2019 the us trade representative “ustr” imposed import tariffs of 25 on a long list of products imported from china including inverters and power optimizers on january 15 2020 the united states and china entered into an initial trade deal which preserves the initial tariffs from 2018 and indicates additional sanctions may be imposed if china breaches the terms of the deal 

 

in order to mitigate the negative effect of increased tariffs we increased our manufacturing capabilities at our vietnam manufacturing facility beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 we reached full manufacturing capacity in our manufacturing facility in israel sella 1 and are planning to start volume manufacturing in mexico during the second half of 2022 for the year ended december 31 2021 the majority of our products being imported to the us are manufactured in vietnam israel and hungary and are therefore not subject to the aforementioned tariffs 

 

seasonality 

 

the solar energy market is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations affected by weather for example during the winter months in europe and the northeastern us where the climate is particularly cold and snowy it is typical to see a decline in pv installations and this decline can impact the timing of orders for our products 

 

sustainable responsible and transparent business practices 

 

during 2021 we continued making progress in our environmental social and governance esg performance and disclosure our esg practices are guided by our social purpose “to power the future of energy so we can all enjoy better living and a cleaner greener future” and our social mission “shaping the future of sustainable energy production energy storage and emobility through innovation” we have crafted a comprehensive sustainability strategy with 2025 targets in several areas our third annual sustainability report published in 2021 meets the requirements of leading global sustainability disclosure standards gri global reporting initiative and sasb sustainability accounting standards board aligning our disclosure with leading corporations around the world and with the expectations of investors and other stakeholders our sustainability strategy includes the following pillars 

 



 



 



 

we believe that our sustainability strategy aligns directly with 10 united nations sustainable development goals sdgs and our products and activities are most critical to achievement of sdg 7 affordable clean energy 

 

human capital 

 

we believe our success depends on our ability to attract and retain outstanding employees at all levels of our business as of december 31 2021 we had 3964 employees full time and part time of these employees 1105 were engaged in research and development 453 in sales and marketing 2052 in operations production qr and support and 354 in general and administrative capacities of our employees 2189 were based in israel 483 were based in korea 262 were based in the us 187 were based in china 253 were based in italy and an additional 590 were based elsewhere 

 

except for our solaredge automation machines employees and the employees of solaredge emobility none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced any employmentrelated work stoppages and we consider relations with our employees to be good 

 

recruitment as a rapidly growing business we rely on the success of our recruitment efforts to attract and retain technically skilled people who can support our ongoing innovation and expansion we aim to be inclusive in our hiring practices focusing on the best talent for the role welcoming all genders nationalities ethnicities abilities and other dimensions of diversity 

 

employee benefits we aim to provide our employees with competitive salary and benefits that enable them to achieve a good quality of life and plan for the future our benefits differ according to local norms and market preferences but typically include all salary and social benefits required by local law including retirement saving programs paid vacation and sick leave and many additional benefits that go beyond legal requirements in local markets 

 

leadership training and development we aim to provide our employees with advanced professional and development skills so that they can perform effectively in their roles and build their capabilities and career prospects for the future we maintain a leadership program for managers and team leaders and deliver advanced professional training for sales research and development and other functional teams as part of our extensive training program each year furthermore we partner with local educational resources to offer formal learning programs on a variety of subjects for the personal development and advancement of our workforce 

 

diversity equity and inclusion during the past three years we have more than doubled the total number of women in our organization adding women at all levels we are striving to increase the presence of women in executive and management positions as part of our 2025 target to promote gender parity and equal pay 

 

we are taking active steps to increase the diversity of our workforce and inclusiveness of our employee base for example in 2021 we engaged in several partnerships with social organizations in israel designed to increase our recruitment of candidates from the arabisraeli population ultraorthodox women and individuals with disabilities additionally in 2021 as part of our commitment to creating a platform for gender equalization within the workforce we initiated a global program for the professional development of key talent among women within the company 

 

workplace safety and health we believe that all accidents and injuries at work are preventable and we strive to achieve a zeroinjury culture across our offices and operations we comply with applicable occupational health and safety regulations and are certified to occupational health and safety quality management standard iso 450012018 our injury rates are low 

 

during the covid19 pandemic we have been offering most of our employees the flexibility to work remotely when possible and have implemented rigorous hygiene and social distancing practices in the workplace we also offer our employees free antigen testing additionally we provide resources to our employees such as information and subsidized counseling for a large population of our employees to address the psychological challenges caused by the pandemic

 item 1a risk factors 

 

risk factors summary 

the following summarizes the principal factors that make an investment in our company speculative or risky all of which are more fully described in the risk factors section below this summary should be read in conjunction with the risk factors section and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business the order of presentation is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each factor poses to us

we face risks related to legal compliance and regulatory matters including those related to 

 

  

we face risks related to intellectual property including those related to 

  

we face risks related to the ownership of our common stock including those related to related to the ownership of our common stock 

  

the summary risk factors described above should be read together with the text of the full risk factors in the risk factors sections and the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes as well as in other documents that we file with the sec the risks summarized above or described in full below are not the only risks that we face additional risks and uncertainties not precisely known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects 

 

risk factors 

 

you should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

 

risks related to our business and our industry 

 

we cannot be certain that we will sustain our current level of profitability in the future 

 

our revenue and profitability for the year ended december 31 2020 did not grow as we previously anticipated mainly due to the adverse effects of covid19 on demands for our products and on the global economy in general in 2021 we experienced an increase in revenues and profitability when compared to the same period in 2020 however in the future our revenues from both solar and nonsolar business may not grow at the pace we anticipate or may decline for a number of reasons many of which are outside our control including a decline in demand for our products increased competition a decrease in the growth of the solar industry the short term and long term effects of covid19 on our industry and business and the recent industry trends including component shortages and supply chain disruptions due to ocean freight capacity shipping times and port congestions as well as inflationary pressure or our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities if we fail to maintain sufficient revenue to support our operations we may not be able to sustain profitability 

 

in addition we expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business including in connection with recent or future acquisitions as well as ongoing marketing and developing our products development of our own manufacturing facilities expanding into new product markets and geographies maintaining and enhancing our research and development operations and hiring additional personnel we do not know whether our revenues will grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs or the extent of these expenses or their impact on our results of operations 

 

the rapidly evolving and competitive nature of the solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects our entry into other adjacent markets through recent acquisitions is new and highly competitive and it is difficult to evaluate our future in these new markets as well 

 

the rapidly evolving and competitive nature of the solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects in addition we have limited insight into emerging trends that may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects our nonsolar businesses in adjacent markets such as storage and emobility are new to us and these are highly competitive markets in which we will need to compete we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries including unpredictable and volatile revenues and increased expenses as our business continues to grow the viability and demand for our products may be affected by many factors beyond our control including 

 

  

if demand for solar energy solutions does not continue to grow or grows at a slower rate than anticipated our business and results of operations will suffer 

 

our revenues are primarily derived from products utilized in solar pv installations thus our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years and we cannot be certain that consumers businesses or utilities will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to grow our business if demand for solar energy solutions fails to continue to develop sufficiently demand for our products will decrease resulting in an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business 

 

the current revenues generated from our emobility business are dependent on orders from a leading automotive manufacturer the automotive industry is facing significant shortages of components for their assembly and their slowdown in manufacturing could delay orders of our powertrain kits 

 

shortages in components in the automotive industry including semiconductors due in large part to strong crossindustry demand have presented challenges and global production disruptions many leading automotive manufacturers have announced that these shortages will remain constrained and could extend into 2023 as a result during 2021 our leading customer announced temporary suspensions of its manufacturing due to component shortages these suspensions may occur again in 2022 and cause delays of orders for our powertrain units and an accumulation of inventory related to the production of these products which in turn may have an adverse effect on our revenues profitability and other financial results from this business 

 

additionally projects in the automotive industry are long term and involve a long qualification process our emobility business currently does not have additional substantial projects in the pipeline beyond the project with stellantis which was announced in february 2021 our inability to enter into additional projects may have an adverse effect on our revenues profitability and other financial results from the emobility business 

 

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

 

decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid or other renewable energy resources would make the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and would likely lower sales of our products the price of electricity derived from the utility grid could decrease as a result of 

 

  

moreover technological developments in the solar components industry could allow our competitors and their customers to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be offered by us to our customers which could result in reduced demand for our products if the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations incorporating our systems is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

 

an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a solar pv system and could reduce the demand for smart energy products and thus demand for our products 

 

many endusers depend on financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build or purchase a solar pv system as a result an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or the endusers to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a solar pv system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our products which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of endusers install solar pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through financing an increase in interest rates could lower such enduser’s return on investment on a solar pv system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar pv systems and in each case could cause such endusers to seek alternative investments furthermore the continuous effects of covid19 on the economy may detrimentally influence the endusers willingness to invest in solar pv systems both due to endusers’ economic uncertainty as well as the market’s unwillingness to extend favorable financial terms to the endusers 

 

the market for our products is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce power optimizers inverters solar pv system monitoring and other smart energy products which could negatively affect our results of operations and market share 

 

the market for solar pv solutions is highly competitive we principally compete with traditional inverter manufacturers as well as microinverter manufacturers currently our dc optimized inverter system competes with products from traditional inverter manufacturers microinverter manufacturers as well as emerging technology companies offering alternative mlpe products over the past few years several new entrants to the inverter and mlpe market including lowcost asian manufacturers have announced plans to ship or have already shipped products in markets in which we sell our products including with respect to sales in the united states australia and in europe we expect competition to intensify as new and existing competitors enter the market in addition there are several new entrants that are proposing solution to the rapid shutdown functionality which has become a regulatory requirement for pv rooftop solar systems in the united states if these new technologies are successful in offering a price competitive and technological attractive solution to the residential solar pv market this could make it more difficult for us to maintain market share 

 

several of our existing and potential competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices for our products in order to compete effectively if we have to reduce our prices by more than we anticipated or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer 

 

in addition competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than us may partner with other competitors to provide combined technologies and competing solutions and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours 

 

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may have a material adverse effect on demand for our offerings 

 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advances in other forms of distributed solar pv power generation storage solutions such as batteries the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could result in product obsolescence the loss of competitiveness of our products decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors 

 

the solar industry has historically been cyclical and experienced periodic downturns 

 

our future success partly depends on continued demand for solar pv systems in the endmarkets we serve including the residential and commercial sectors in the united states and europe the solar industry has historically been cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns which may affect demand for our products the solar industry has undergone challenging business conditions in past years including downward pricing pressure for pv modules mainly as a result of overproduction and reductions in applicable governmental subsidies contributing to demand decreases therefore there is no assurance that the solar industry will not suffer significant downturns in the future which will adversely affect demand for our solar products and our results of operations 

 

defects or performance problems in our products could result in loss of customers reputational damage and decreased revenue and we may face warranty indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products 

 

although our products meet our stringent quality requirements they may contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new generations are released errors defects or poor performance can arise due to design flaws defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties which can affect both the quality and the yield of the product any actual or perceived errors defects or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products or components thereof shipment delays rejection of our products damage to our reputation lost revenue diversion of our personnel from our product development efforts and increases in customer service and support costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

furthermore defective components may give rise to warranty indemnity or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive from the affected products in most cases we offer a minimum 12year limited warranty for our inverters extendable to twentyfive years for an additional cost a 25year limited warranty for our power optimizers and a 10year limited warranty for our residential energy bank battery our limited warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship of our products under normal use and service conditions therefore we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold products and recognized revenue while we do have accrued reserves for warranty claims our estimated warranty costs for previously sold products may change to the extent future products are not compatible with earlier generation products under warranty our warranty accruals are based on our assumptions and we do not have a long history of making such assumptions as a result these assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our systems causing us to incur substantial unanticipated expenses to repair or replace defective products in the future or to compensate customers for defective products our failure to accurately predict future claims could result in unexpected volatility in and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition in particular our residential energy hub battery is new on the market and we do not have the experience in servicing this product yet 

 

if one of our products were to cause injury to someone or cause property damage then we could be exposed to product liability claims and lawsuits which could result in significant costs and liabilities if damages are awarded against us further any product liability claim we face could be expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention the successful assertion of a product liability claim against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages penalties or fines subject us to adverse publicity damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely affect sales of our products in addition product liability claims injuries defects or other problems experienced by other companies in the residential solar industry could lead to unfavorable market conditions for the industry as a whole 

 

we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers 

 

while we are manufacturing a small portion of our products in israel we still heavily rely upon our contract manufacturers to manufacture most of our products we mainly rely on two contract manufacturers any change in our relationship or contractual terms with our contract manufacturers or changes in our contract manufacturers’ ability to comply with their contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs even though we have commenced manufacturing in our facility in israel the expected production volumes will not be sufficient to relieve our significant dependence on our contract manufacturers in addition we remain heavily dependent on suppliers of the components needed for our manufacturing 

 

the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues therefore fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner especially considering restrictions imposed by covid19 in addition the facilities in which our products are manufactured are located outside of the us currently in china vietnam israel hungary and most recently mexico where the ramping up process has recently begun the location of these facilities outside of key markets such as the us increases shipping time thereby causing a long lead time between manufacturing and delivery in addition for approximately twelve weeks in the third quarter of 2021 our manufacturing facility in vietnam was shut down due to government imposed covid19 related lockdowns 

 

if either of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or continue to supply under existing terms we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers which may not be available to us when needed or may be unable to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers or increase our shipping costs to make up for delays in manufacturing which in turn could reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers subject us to liquidated damages for late deliveries and damage our reputation with local installers and potential endusers all of which will cause us to forego potential revenue opportunities further the ramp of a new contract manufacturer is time consuming and draining on the resources of our operations team 

 

we may experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations 

 

our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise involving several precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be identified and properly rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques andor expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased warranty reserve increased costs and delays all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for key components and raw materials in our products to adequately meet anticipated demand due to the limited number of such suppliers any changes or shortages in raw materials or key components we use could result in sales delays higher costs associated with air shipments cancellations and loss of market share 

 

we depend on limited or single source suppliers for certain key components and raw materials used to manufacture our products making us susceptible to quality issues shortages and price changes any of these limited or single source suppliers could stop supplying or offering at commercially reasonable prices our components or raw materials cease operations or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors because there are a few suppliers of raw materials used to manufacture our products it may be difficult to timely identify andor qualify alternate suppliers on commercially reasonable terms therefore our ability to satisfy customer demand may be adversely affected transitioning to a new supplier or redesigning a product to accommodate a new component manufacturer would result in additional costs and delays that could harm our business or financial performance 

 

managing our supplier and contractor relationships is particularly difficult when we are introducing new products for example as we began to ramp assembly and production of powertrain kits for the automotive industry we became heavily reliant on new thirdparty suppliers that needed to be approved through rigorous testing and validation processes for use in our supply chain once selected it is time consuming and costly to replace such vendors the same is true for our recently introduced residential energy hub battery for production of which we rely on a single source for supply of the lithium ion cells  any delay or shortage of supply or inability to deliver the components to our manufacturing facilities could harm our business or financial performance 

 

any interruption in the supply of limited source components or raw materials for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could result in lost revenue or higher expenses associated with increased air shipments required to meet customer demand in a timely manner and would harm our business for example we continue to experience raw material shortages due to increased lead time which may affect our ability to timely receive certain components within the previously expected lead times these shortages may result in a delay in sales higher costs associated with air shipments cancellations of orders by customersliquidated damages for late deliveries and loss of market share 

 

we rely on distributors and large installers to assist in selling our products and the failure of these customers to perform as expected could reduce our future revenues 

 

our customers’ decisions to purchase our products are influenced by several factors outside of our control the agreements we have with some of our largest customers do not have longterm purchase commitments and are generally cancellable by either party after a relatively short notice period the loss of or events affecting one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see note 2x to our consolidated financial statements 

 

in addition we do not have exclusive arrangements with our thirdparty distributors and large installers many of which also market and sell products from our competitors these distributors and large installers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and with little or no notice further these distributors and large installers may fail to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors termination of agreements with current distributors or large installers failure by these distributors or large installers to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new distributor or large installer relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and results of operations 

 

mergers in the solar industry among our current or potential customers may adversely affect our competitive position 

 

there has been an increase in consolidation activities among distributors large installers and other strategic partners in the solar industry for example in october 2020 sunrun a leading provider of residential solar battery storage and energy services acquired vivint solar if this consolidation continues it will further increase our reliance on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales and may negatively impact our competitive position in the solar market 

 

our planned expansion into new geographic markets or new product lines or services could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks 

 

we have in the past and may in the future evaluate opportunities to expand into new geographic markets and introduce new product offerings and services we also may from time to time engage in acquisitions of businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen and expand our market position technological capabilities or provide synergy opportunities for example we intend to continue to introduce new products targeted at large commercial and utilityscale installations and to continue to expand into other international markets 

 

our successful operation in these new markets or any acquired business will depend on a number of factors including our ability to develop solutions to address the requirements of the large commercial and utilityscale solar pv markets timely certification of new products for large commercial and utilityscale solar pv installations acceptance of power optimizers in solar pv markets in which they have not traditionally been used and our ability to manage increased manufacturing capacity and production and to identify and integrate any acquired businesses 

 

further we expect these new solar pv markets and additional markets we have entered or may enter into to have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell our products our success will depend on our ability to properly adapt to these differences which include differing regulatory requirements such as tax laws trade laws labor regulations tariffs export quotas customs duties or other trade restrictions limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection international political or economic conditions restrictions on the repatriation of earnings longer sales cycles warranty expectations product return policies and cost and performance and compatibility requirements in addition expanding into new geographic markets will increase our exposure to existing risks such as fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and increased expenses in complying with us and foreign laws regulations and trade standards including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” 

 

failure to successfully develop and introduce these new products successfully integrate acquired businesses or to otherwise manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to sustain profitability 

 

if we fail to build our nonsolar businesses and future growth effectively we may be unable to execute our business plan maintain high levels of customer service or adequately address competitive challenges 

 

we have experienced significant growth in recent periods with our annual product sales growing rapidly from approximately 152500 inverters and approximately 36 million power optimizers in the fiscal year ending june 30 2015 to annual product sales exceeding 788411 inverters and 186 million power optimizers in the year ended december 31 2021 we intend to continue to expand our business significantly within existing and new markets this growth has placed and any future growth may place a significant strain on our management operational and financial infrastructure in particular we will be required to expand train and manage our growing employee base and scale and otherwise improve our it infrastructure in tandem with such headcount growth our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers as well as manage multiple geographic locations 

 

our current and planned operations personnel customer support it information systems and other systems and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth and may require us to make additional unanticipated investment in our infrastructure our success and ability to further scale our business will depend in part on our ability to manage these changes in an efficient manner if we cannot manage our growth we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business plans or strategies or respond to competitive pressures this could also result in declines in quality or customer satisfaction increased costs difficulties in introducing new offerings or other operational difficulties any failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our business and reputation 

 

conversely the global pandemic and resulting economic downturn in many regions require our ability to be flexible and decrease expenses where growth has slowed down our ability to timely react to market conditions is not always in our control and any inability to do so could also adversely impact our business 

 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversion of our convertible senior notes or notes in cash or to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion of the notes or to repurchase the notes 

 

holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indentures governing their respective notes at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid special interest if any in addition upon conversion of the notes unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of notes surrendered or notes being converted in addition our ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the notes may be limited by law regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing such notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes as required by such indenture would constitute a default under such indenture a default under the indenture governing the notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness if the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversion of the notes 

 

 

any unauthorized access to disclosure or theft of personal information we gather store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation 

 

our business and operations may be impacted by data security breaches and cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to confidential data we receive store and use certain personal information of our employees customers and the endusers of our customers’ solar pv systems we take steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the personal information we process however we have been subject to cybersecurity attacks and other information technology system disruptions in the past and there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized access use or disclosure will not occur despite our efforts because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until after they are launched against a target we and our suppliers or vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigatory measures 

 

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee or contractor error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business particularly in light of the european general data protection regulation the california consumer privacy act and china personal information protection law pip which came into effect november 1 2021 if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information were to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

third parties our employees or our vendors might gain unauthorized access to our network or seek to compromise our products and services 

 

occasionally we face attempts by others including our own employees or vendors to access our networks to gain unauthorized access through the internet introduce malicious software to our information technology it systems or corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide we or our products may be a target of computer hackers organizations or malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products employees and customers or interrupt our systems or those of our customers or others occasionally we encounter intrusions or attempts at gaining unauthorized access to our network to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations although there can be no guarantee that such impacts will not be material in the future while we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network and products and to prevent their recurrence where practicable we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats in addition to intentional thirdparty cybersecurity breaches the integrity and confidentiality of company and customer data may be compromised as a result of human error product defects or technological failures cybersecurity breaches whether successful or unsuccessful and other it system interruptions including those resulting from human error and technological failures could subject us to significant costs arising from  among others rebuilding internal systems reduced inventory value providing modifications to our products and services defending against litigation responding to official inquiries or actions paying damages or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties 

 

our entry into business engagements with military bodies as our customers in the lithiumion battery and energy storage business embodies a risk for potentially largescale and uncapped liability 

 

as a result of the acquisition of kokam we sell a small portion of our products to customers who integrate our storage systems or cells and then sell these products to military customers our sales to military customers often involve standard form contracts which may not be subject to negotiation in particular certain of these contracts involve unlimited damages provisions that could result in largescale liabilities 

 

our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments in particular we may not succeed in future acquisitions or be effective in integrating such acquisitions 

 

as part of our growth strategy we have made a number of acquisitions and may continue to make acquisitions and investments in the future we frequently evaluate the tactical or strategic opportunities available related to complementary businesses products or technologies there can be no assurance that we will be successful in making additional acquisitions even if we are successful in making additional acquisitions integrating an acquired company’s business into ours or investing in new technologies may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and large expenditures and absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business both of which may result in the loss of key customers or personnel and expose us to unanticipated liabilities further we may not be able to retain the key employees that may be necessary to operate the businesses we acquire and we may not be able to attract in a timely manner new skilled employees and management to replace them 

 

we may not be able to consummate acquisitions or investments that we have identified as crucial to the implementation of our strategy for other commercial or economic reasons further we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals including those of competition authorities and foreign investment authorities in countries where we seek to consummate acquisitions or make investments for those and other reasons we may ultimately fail to consummate an acquisition even if we announce the intended acquisition 

 

lithiumion used in our battery cells and packs can potentially catch fire or vent smoke and cause damage or injury 

 

the battery cells and packs produced by our subsidiary kokam and the solaredge energy bank battery which launched during the second quarter of 2021 make use of lithiumion cells we regularly test our products and take safety measures when manufacturing selling and installing battery cells and packs however due to the high energy density of lithiumion cells mishandling inappropriate storage or delivery noncompliance with safety instructions or field failures can potentially cause a battery cell to rapidly release its stored energy which may in turn cause a thermal event that can ignite nearby materials including other lithiumion cells as the use of lithiumion batteries becomes more widespread these events may occur more often causing damage to property injury lawsuits and adverse publicity which may adversely affect our reputation results of operations or financial condition 

 

conditions in israel affect our operations and may limit our ability to develop produce and sell our products 

 

our headquarters and research and development center are located in israel accordingly political economic and military conditions in israel directly affect us israel has been involved in a number of armed conflicts and is the target of terrorist activity including threats from hezbollah militants in lebanon iranian militia in syria and others ongoing state of hostility varying in degree such as rocket fire from the gaza strip has occurred on an irregular basis disrupting daytoday civilian activity and negatively affecting business conditions we cannot predict whether or when such armed conflicts or attacks may occur or the extent to which such events may impact us any future armed conflict political instability or violence in the region may impede our ability to manage our business effectively operate our manufacturing plant in northern israel engage in research and development or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations in the event of war we may be forced to cease operations which may cause delays in the distribution and sale of our products some of our directors executive officers and employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and are subject to being called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances in the event that our principal executive office is damaged as a result of hostile action or hostilities otherwise disrupting the ongoing operation of our offices our ability to operate could be materially adversely affected 

 

additionally several countries principally in the middle east restrict doing business with israeli companies and additional countries and groups may impose similar restrictions if hostilities in israel or political instability in the region continue or increase if instability in neighboring states results in the establishment of fundamentalist islamic regimes or governments more hostile to israel or if egypt turkey or jordan abrogates its respective peace treaty with israel israel could be subject to additional political economic and military confines and our operations and ability to sell our products to countries in the region could be materially adversely affected 

 

any hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners or significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the tax benefits that are available to us under israeli law require us to meet various conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future which could increase our costs and taxes 

 

our israeli subsidiary was eligible for certain tax benefits provided to “benefited enterprises” under the israeli law for the encouragement of capital investments 1959 the “investments law” beginning in january 2019 and with respect to its taxable results from 2019 onwards our israeli subsidiary further elected to apply the terms of the investments law as per “preferred enterprise” “pe” or “preferred technological enterprise” “pte” in order to remain eligible for the tax benefits for “benefited enterprises” with respect to our israeli subsidiary’s taxable results until 2018 and with respect to its taxable results from 2019 for pe or pte we must continue to meet certain conditions stipulated in the investments law and its regulations as amended if these tax benefits are reduced cancelled or discontinued our israeli taxable income would be subject to regular israeli corporate tax rates and we may be required to refund any tax benefits that we have already received plus interest and penalties thereon the statutory corporate tax rate for israeli companies is 23 as of january 1 2018 and onward additionally if we increase our activities outside of israel through acquisitions or otherwise through our israeli subsidiary our existing or expanded activities might not be eligible for inclusion in existing or future israeli tax benefit programs the israeli government may furthermore independently determine to reduce phase out or eliminate entirely the benefit programs under the investments law regardless of whether we then qualify for benefits under those programs at the time which would also adversely affect our global tax rate and our results of operations 

 

it may be difficult to enforce a judgment of a us court against our officers and directors to assert us securities laws claims in israel or to serve process on our officers and directors 

 

many of our directors and executive officers their assets and most of our assets are located outside of the us consequently a judgment obtained against any of these persons including a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws may not be collectible in the us it also may be difficult to effect service of process on these persons in the us or to assert us securities law claims in original actions instituted in israel israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of us securities laws on the grounds of forum non conveniens  in addition even if an israeli court hears a claim it may determine that israeli law and not us law is applicable to the claim if us law is found to be applicable the content of applicable us law must be proven as a fact by expert witnesses which can be a lengthy and costly process further an israeli court may not enforce a judgment awarded by a us or other nonisraeli court certain matters of procedure will also be governed by israeli law there is little binding case law in israel that addresses these matters as a result of the difficulty associated with enforcing a judgment against any of these persons in israel judgment against many of our directors and executive officers may be unachievable or unenforceable 

 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our operations and financial results 

  

the covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our supply chain operations and initially on customer demand as a result of the covid19 pandemic governmental authorities worldwide have imposed mandatory closures stayathome orders and social distancing protocols that significantly limit the movement of people goods and services or otherwise restrict normal business operations or consumption patterns our compliance with these measures has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business and operations as well as that of our key customers and suppliers additionally to support the health and wellbeing of our employees our workforce has spent a significant amount of time working remotely which has impacted our daytoday operations our ability to meet customers demand and create future sales and business opportunities the covid19 pandemic has resulted in slower growth and demand for our products and may continue to impact our revenues in the following quarters mainly contingent on the duration of the global economic downturn in addition since the outbreak and the restrictions on travel our ability to travel to customers manufacturing facilities and to suppliers has been limited and our marketing activities exhibitions and shows have also been significantly reduced or have been held virtually we also have had disruption to our manufacturing in vietnam during the third quarter of 2021 which led to a reduction of our supply in the third and fourth quarter 2021 

 

the full extent the effects covid19 will have on our business depends on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to currently accurately predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic governmental business and individual responses to the pandemic the effect on our customers and customer demand for our products disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work and travel availability and longterm effectiveness of covid19 vaccination especially in light of its recent more contagious mutation 

 

more generally the covid19 pandemic raises the possibility of an extended global economic downturn and has caused volatility in financial markets which may continue to adversely affect demand for our products and could adversely affect our results and financial condition in subsequent quarters for example some of our customers could potentially experience financial difficulties which in turn could hinder us in collecting receivables as well as cause a decrease in the demand for our products which could negatively affect our revenues additionally some of our suppliers may experience delivery delays or financial difficulties resulting in supply constraints and increased costs or delays to our productions furthermore we may experience delays in timely delivery of our products to our customers exposing us to cancellations of orders andor potential liquidated damages resulting from our inability to timely delivery our products 

 

the unprecedented and continuously evolving nature of covid19 other pandemics or epidemics could also have the effect of amplifying many of the other risks described in this item 1a risk factors  

 

we are dependent on ocean transportation to deliver our products in a timely and cost efficient manner if we are unable to use ocean transportation to deliver our products our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 

 

we rely on ocean transportation for the delivery of most of our products to our customers and when unavailable incompatible with customer delivery time requirements or when we are unable to accommodate accelerated delivery times due to growing customer volume demands we rely on alternative more expensive air transportation our ability to deliver our products via ocean transportation could be adversely impacted by shortages in available cargo capacity changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling pricing payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel taxes and labor disruptions to ports and other shipping facilities as a result of the covid19 or other epidemics and other factors not within our control if we are unable to use ocean transportation and are required to substitute more expensive air transportation our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 

 

in the year ended december 31 2021 we experienced and continue to experience an increase in the cost of goods sold due to an increase in shipping rates that resulted from a reduction in ocean freight capacity the accumulation of containers in the us and europe that were not returned to asia and the reduction in the availability of air freight that increased the demand for ocean freight we also experienced and expect to continue to experience disruptions to our logistics supply chain caused by constraints in the global transportation system including limited availability of local ground transportation coupled with congestion in ports and borders 

the factors discussed above caused transit time to almost double in 2021 compared to prepandemic transit time in the second half of 2021 the chinese rail company which was routinely used by the us to ship products out of china cancelled allocations of containers for shipments from china to europe in the fourth quarter of 2021 trucks carrying our products were stuck between the borders of kazakhstan mongolia and china when such borders closed due to governmental mandates related to covid19 we also experienced congestion in other borders such as the vietnam border which was closed periodically in 2021 due to covid19 governmental mandates even when borders were opened there was a severe backlog of trucks waiting to cross the border which created further delays there is no assurance that these delays and increased costs in goods sold will not continue in 2022 

 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

  

although our financial results are reported in us dollars 543 of our revenues in the year ended december 31 2021 were generated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition a significant portion of our operating expenses are accrued in new israeli shekels primarily related to payroll the euro andto a lesser extent the south korean won “krw” and other currencies as detailed in the foreign currency exchange risk under item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and to a lesser extent the new israeli shekel krw and other currencies in which we generate revenues incur expenses and maintain cash balances foreign currency fluctuations may also affect the prices of our products which are denominated primarily in us dollars if there is a devaluation of a particular currency the prices of our products will increase relative to the local currency and may be less competitive despite our efforts to minimize foreign currency risks primarily by maintaining cash balances in new israeli shekels significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values in particular a significant change in the relative values of the euro and new israeli shekel krw and other currencies against the us dollar could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition 

 

occasionally we may enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge the exchange rates impacts on our assets and liabilities denominated in israeli shekels euro krw and other currencies 

  

our hedging activities may also contribute to increased losses as a result of volatility in foreign currency markets if foreign exchange currency markets continue to be volatile such fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations in future periods and may make it difficult to hedge our foreign currency exposures effectively 

 

we are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility 

 

we are facing increasing scrutiny related to our environmental social and governance “esg” practices and requested disclosures by institutional and individual investors who are increasingly using esg screening criteria in making investment decisions our disclosures on these matters or a failure to satisfy evolving stakeholder expectations for esg practices and reporting may potentially harm our reputation and impact relationships with investors certain market participants including major institutional investors use thirdparty benchmarks or scores to measure our esg practices in making investment decisions furthermoresome of our customers and suppliers evaluate our esg practices or request that we adopt certain esg policies as a condition of awarding contracts in addition our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals targets and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce or at all could expose us to government enforced actions andor private litigation as esg bestpractices reporting standards and disclosure requirements continue to develop we may incur increasing costs related to esg monitoring and reporting 

risks related to legal compliance and regulations 

 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business 

 

federal state local and foreign government bodies provide incentives to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates tax credits or exemptions and other financial incentives the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives because our customers’ sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the desirability of solar electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business for example in 2015 the us congress passed a multiyear extension to the solar investment tax credit itc such extension helped grow the us solar market as of january 1 2021 the itc is reduced from 30 percent to 26 percent for both residential and commercial projects and is expected to reach 10 percent for commercial projects in 2024 the reduction in the itc could reduce the demand for solar energy solutions in the us which would have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore due to the continued economic downturn from covid19 many of the institutions utilizing itc may significantly pull back or no longer have the ability to invest meaning that financing for solar projects may become seriously diminished 

 

in general subsidies and incentives may expire on a particular date end when the allocated funding is reduced or terminated due to inter alia  legal challenges adoption of new statutes or regulations or the passage of time they often occur without warning 

 

in addition several jurisdictions have adopted renewable portfolio standards mandating that a certain portion of electricity delivered by utilities to customers come from a set of eligible renewable energy resources such as solar by a certain compliance date under some programs a utility can receive a “credit” for renewable energy produced by a third party by either purchasing the electricity directly from the producer or paying a fee to obtain the right to renewable energy generated but used or sold by the generator a renewable energy credit allows the utility to add this electricity to its renewable portfolio requirement without actually expending the capital for generating facilities however there can be no assurances that such policies will continue reduction or elimination of renewable portfolio standards or successful efforts to meet current standards could harm or halt the growth of the solar pv industry and our business 

 

changes to net metering policies may reduce demand for electricity from solar pv systems and harm our business 

 

our business benefits from favorable net metering policies in most us states and some european countries that allow a solar pv system owner to pay his or her electric utility only for power usage net of production from the solar pv system system owners receive credit for the energy that the solar installation generates to offset energy usage at times when the solar installation is not generating energy under a net metering program the customer typically pays for the net energy used or receives a credit against future bills if more energy is produced than consumed 

 

most us states have adopted some form of net metering yet net metering programs have recently come under regulatory scrutiny in some us states due to allegations that net metering policies inequitably shift costs onto nonsolar ratepayers by allowing solar ratepayers to sell electricity at rates that are too high for utilities to recoup their fixed costs for example in 2019 louisiana public service commissions adopted net metering policies aiming at lowering the solar customers’ savings in december 2021 the california public utilities commission proposed lowering current net energy metering tariffs in addition to imposing a new gridconnection fee on new rooftop solar users we cannot assure you that these programs will not be significantly modified going forward 

 

if the value of the credit that customers receive for net metering is reduced endusers may be unable to recognize the current level of cost savings associated with net metering the absence of favorable net metering policies or of net metering entirely or the imposition of new charges that only or disproportionately affect endusers that use net metering would significantly limit demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future growth 

 

existing electric utility industry regulations and changes to regulations may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar pv systems that may significantly reduce demand for our products or harm our ability to compete in addition determinations of various regulatory bodies regarding lack of compliance with certifications or other regulatory requirements could harm our ability to sell our products in certain countries 

 

federal state local and foreign government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry and internal policies and regulations promulgated by electric utilities heavily influence the market for electricity generation products and services and could deter purchases of solar pv systems sold by our customers significantly reducing the potential demand for our products for example utilities commonly charge fees to larger industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for backup purposes these fees could increase the cost to use solar pv systems sold by our customers and make them less desirable thereby harming our business prospects financial condition and results of operations in addition depending on the region electricity generated by solar pv systems competes most effectively with expensive peakhour electricity from the electric grid rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the utilities’ peak hour pricing policies or rate design such as to a flat rate could require the price of solar pv systems and their component parts to be lower in order to compete with the price of electricity from the electric grid   changes in current laws or regulations applicable to us or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the us europe or other jurisdictions in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations any changes to government or internal utility regulations and policies that favor electric utilities could reduce the competitiveness of solar pv systems sold by our customers and causing a significant reduction in demand for our products and services in addition changes in our products or changes in export and import laws and implementing regulations may delay the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether resulting in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

compliance with various regulatory requirements and standards is a prerequisite for placing our products on the market in most countries in which we do business we have all such certifications but there are at times challenges by local administrative telecommunications consumer board or other authorities that can place sales bans on products for example in december 2021 the swedish electrical safety board announced that certain models of our power optimizers are subject to a sales ban alleging that they do not meet the emc directive while we disagree with this finding and maintain our position that all current solaredge products are tested approved and compliant with the emc directive and other eu regulations  any such rulings can have a negative impact on our business and reputation in this specific incident we have already begun transitioning into our next generation optimizers and do not expect any impact on our business in sweden or elsewhere 

 

risks related to intellectual property 

 

if we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 

 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and unfair competition laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions with our customers suppliers employees and others to establish and protect our intellectual property ip and other proprietary rights our ability to enforce these rights is subject to litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries specifically claims that our ip rights are invalid or unenforceable our assertion of ip rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us which could harm our business our inability to enforce our ip rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and business 

 

we have applied for patents in the us europe and china some of which have been issued we cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to among other things rebrand or redesign our affected products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the us we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated infringed or otherwise violated 

 

our intellectual property may be stolen or infringed upon in fact as further detailed in item 3 – “legal proceedings” we are engaged in several legal proceedings related to intellectual property litigation proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings may occur including monetary damages injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products or requiring other remedies these lawsuits are intended to protect our significant investment in our intellectual property but they also may consume management and financial resources for long periods of time and may not result in favorable outcome for us which may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert management’s attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate 

 

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry occasionally we may also be subject to claims of intellectual property right infringement and related litigation and as we gain greater recognition in the market we face a higher risk of being the subject to claims of violation of others’ intellectual property rights for example in may 2019 we were served with three lawsuits by huawei technologies co ltd a chinese entity “huawei” against our two chinese subsidiaries and our equipment manufacturer in china the lawsuits filed in the guangzhou intellectual property court alleged infringement of three patents and asked for an injunction to manufacture use sale and offer for sale and damages in august 2020 a firstinstance judgment was issued ordering the three defendants to collectively pay damages in the amount of approximately 16 million including court fees and our appeal to the supreme people’s court was denied in december 2021 rendering a payment due by us to huawei in the amount of 16 million the judgement is not enforceable until february 2022 the other two lawsuits are still pending appeal at the supreme court level please see item 3  legal proceedings for additional information 

 

although we are certain that we have meritorious defenses to the claims responding to such claims can be time consuming divert management’s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses in litigation or settlement while we believe that our products and technology do not infringe in any material respect upon any valid thirdparty ip rights we cannot be certain of successfully defending against any such claims if we do not successfully defend or settle an ip claim we could be liable for significant monetary damages and could be prohibited from continuing to use certain technology business methods content or brands to avoid a prohibition we could seek a license from the applicable third party which could require us to pay significant royalties increasing our operating expenses if a license is unavailable at all or unavailable on reasonable terms we may be required to develop or license a nonviolating alternative either of which could require significant effort and expense if we cannot license or develop a nonviolating alternative we could be forced to modify limit or in extreme cases stop manufacturing and sales of our affected products in the relevant country and may be unable to effectively compete any of these results could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees which could result in litigation and adversely affect our business 

 

we enter into agreements with our employees pursuant to which they agree that any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement are assigned to us or owned exclusively by us depending on the jurisdiction without the employee retaining any rights a significant portion of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees in the course of their employment for us under the israeli patent law 57271967 the “patent law” inventions conceived by an employee during the scope of his or her employment with a company are regarded as “service inventions” which belong to the employer absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer giving the employee service invention rights the patent law also provides that if there is no such agreement between an employer and an employee the israeli compensation and royalties committee the “committee” a body constituted under the patent law shall determine whether the employee is entitled to remuneration for his or her inventions case law clarifies that the right to receive consideration for “service inventions” can be waived by the employee and that in certain circumstances such waiver does not necessarily have to be explicit the committee will examine on a casebycase basis the general contractual framework between the parties using interpretation rules of the general israeli contract laws further the committee has not yet determined the method for calculating this committeeenforced remuneration but rather uses the criteria specified in the patent law although our employees have agreed that any rights related to their inventions are owned exclusively by us we may face claims demanding remuneration in consideration for such acknowledgement as a consequence of such claims we could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to our current andor former employees or be forced to litigate such claims which could negatively affect our business 

 

if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected 

 

due to our latest acquisitions goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 1885 million or approximately 65 of our total assets as of december 31 2021 we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment and we assess on an asneeded basis whether there have been impairments in our other intangible assets which include complex and often subjective assumptions and estimates these assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts to the extent that the factors described above change we could be required to record additional noncash impairment charges in the future which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

risks related to the ownership of our common stock 

 

we cannot assure you that our stock price will not decline or not be subject to significant volatility 

 

shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in march 2015 at a price of 1800 per share and during the year ended december 31 2021 the reported high and low prices of our common stock ranged from 19933 to 38971 per share as further detailed in the performance graph in item 5 below the price of our common stock in 2021 was highly volatile and may fluctuate in response to our results of operations in future periods or due to other factors including factors specific to companies in our industry many of which are beyond our control as a result our share price may experience significant volatility and may not necessarily reflect the value of our expected performance among other factors that could affect our stock price are 

 



 

  

further the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of affected companies in addition the stock prices of many renewable energy companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions changes in us regulations and policies with respect to renewable energy interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation of which we may be the target in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial cost and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

  

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management 

 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may believe advantageous these provisions include

 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

in june and july 2018 we filed three lawsuits for patent infringement against huawei technologies co ltd a chinese entity huawei technologies düsseldorf gmbh a german entity and wattkraft solar gmbh a german distributor for huawei the lawsuits filed in the mannheim district court in germany assert unauthorized use of patented technology and are intended to protect solaredge’s significant investment in its innovative dc optimized inverter technology seeking monetary damages an injunction and recall of infringing huawei inverters and optimizers from the german market the lawsuit is intended to prevent the defendants from selling any multilevel inverters and optimizers infringing upon solaredge’s pv inverter and optimizer technology protected in the asserted patents in germany in november 2021 we withdrew one of the infringement claims after the asserted patent was revoked in the other two lawsuits hearings were held and in one of the proceedings the claim was dismissed and we have appealed to a higher court in the parallel nullity proceedings regarding this patent a hearing has been held but no decision has been rendered the third lawsuit is pending a court appointed expert opinion in addition in january 2021 we extended this complaint to include also the second generation huawei smart pv optimizers we intend to continue to vigorously defend our patented technology 

 

in may 2019 we were served with three lawsuits by huawei technologies co ltd a chinese entity “huawei” against our two chinese subsidiaries and our equipment manufacturer in china the lawsuits filed in the guangzhou intellectual property court alleged infringement of three patents and asked for an injunction of manufacture use sale and offer for sale and damage awards in august 2020 a firstinstance judgment was issued ordering the three defendants to collectively pay damages in the amount of approximately 16 million including court fees with respect of one of the patents and our appeal to the supreme people’s court in that case was denied in december of 2021 rendering a payment due by us to huawei in the amount of 16 million the judgement is not enforceable until the end of february 2022 in addition in january 2021 huawei filed a motion to increase its claimed monetary damages to approximately 79 million with respect to the second lawsuit in february 2021 a preliminary injunction was rendered by the guangzhou intellectual property court with respect to a second lawsuit and applying to seven inverter models in line with the court’s mandate we took immediate action to make software changes to meet the court order and also appealed the decision with the supreme peoples court which is still pending additionally in october 2021 a firstinstance judgment was issued with respect of the third lawsuit ordering the three defendants to collectively pay damages in the amount of approximately 16 million including court fees with respect to one of the patents we filed an appeal with the supreme peoples court which remains pending we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted by huawei 

 

in september 2018 our german subsidiary solaredge technologies gmbh received a complaint filed by a competitor sma solar technology ag “sma” the complaint filed in the district court düsseldorf germany alleges that solaredges 125kw  276kw inverters infringe two of plaintiff’s patents in its complaints sma requests inter alia an injunction rendering account about past sales a recall of products and a determination for a claim for damages for sales in germany sma asserted a value in dispute of 55 million euros approximately 62 million for both patents we challenged the validity of both patents in december 2019 the district court of düsseldorf found one of the two patents to be infringed and we appealed this decision to the appeals court düsseldorf in the parallel nullity proceedings regarding this patent in october 2020 the german patent court rendered the sma patent invalid this invalidity has been appealed by sma due to the invalidity proceedings the infringement proceedings regarding this patent have been stayed with respect to the other patent in november 2019 the first instance court stayed the infringement proceedings since it considered it to be highly likely that the patent would also be invalid we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit 

 

in addition in the normal course of business we may from time to time be named as a party to various legal claims actions and complaints including as a result of initiating such legal claims actions or complaints on behalf of the company it is impossible to predict with certainty whether any resulting liability would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

overview 

 

we develop manufacture and sell products that address a broad range of energy market segments through our diversified product offering including residential commercial and large scale photovoltaic or pv energy storage and backup solutions electric vehicle or ev charging home energy management grid services and virtual power plants as well as products in our nonsolar businesses which address emobility automation machines lithiumion cells and battery packs and ups solutions 

 

further information regarding our business is provided in “part i item 1 business” of this annual report 

 

in the year ended december 31 2021 two customers accounted for 309 of our revenues and our top three customers all distributors together represented 378 of our revenues 

 

our revenues were 14593 million and 19639 million for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 respectively gross margins were 316 and 320 for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 respectively net profits were 1403 million and 1692 million for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 respectively 

 

performance measures 

 

in managing our business and assessing financial performance we supplement the information provided by the financial statements with other operating metrics these operating metrics are utilized by our management to evaluate our business measure our performance identify trends affecting our business and formulate projections we use metrics relating to yearly shipments inverters shipped power optimizers shipped and megawatts shipped to evaluate our sales performance and to track market acceptance of our products from year to year we use metrics relating to monitoring systems monitored and megawatts monitored to evaluate market acceptance of our products and usage of our solution 

 

we provide the “megawatts shipped” metric which is calculated based on nameplate capacity shipped to show adoption of our system on a nameplate capacity basis nameplate capacity shipped is the maximum rated power output capacity of an inverter and corresponds to our financial results in that higher total capacities shipped are generally associated with higher total revenues however revenues increase with each additional unit sold not necessarily each additional mw of capacity sold accordingly we also provide the “inverters shipped” and “power optimizers shipped” operating metrics 

 

covid19 impact  response 

 

covid19 continued to present challenges on our operations and business in 2021 primarily operational challenges which we reported on continuously in our quarterly reports throughout the year although the global distribution of vaccines continues to progress and many governmentimposed restrictions have been lifted or removed the future impact of the covid19 pandemic remains highly uncertain resurgences of covid19 cases and the emergence of new variants may adversely impact our results of operationsour first priority continues to be to protect and support our employees while maintaining company operations and support of our customers with as few disruptions as possible we follow the guidance issued by applicable local authorities and health officials in each region in which we do business including in our headquarters located in israel 

 

in the third quarter of 2021 our contract manufacturer in vietnam was forced to temporarily close its facilities due to government mandated lockdowns the mandatory shut downs lasted 12 weeks and the vietnam factory returned to full capacity in november of 2021 while we increased manufacturing capacity in china israel and hungary in order to compensate for the vietnam factory covid19 related lockdown our aggregate overall manufacturing capacity was negatively impacted and together with shipping constraints caused by port congestions caused a reduction in our finished goods inventory and availability to supply in the third and fourth quarter of 2021 our manufacturing facilities in korea for our energy storage business italy for our emobility components and israel and our contract manufacturers’ facilities in vietnam china and hungary were operational at almost full capacity in the fourth quarter of 2021 as we continued to ramp our new manufacturing site in mexico to the extent that there are no further lockdowns manufacturing capacity will revert to levels that accommodate the growing demand for our products within the first half of 2022 our customer support centers are working at full capacity partially from home continued travel restrictions however continue to have an impact on our operations 

 

in 2021 we experienced and continue to experience an increase in the cost of goods sold due to an increase in shipping rates that resulted from a reduction in ocean freight capacity the accumulation of containers in the ports in us and europe that were not returned to asia and the reduction in the availability of air freight that increased the demand for ocean freight in the fourth quarter of 2021 we experienced and expect to continue to experience in 2022 disruptions to our logistics supply chain caused by constraints in the global transportation system including limited availability of local ground transportation coupled with congestion in shipping ports and industrywide component shortages these factors have impacted our ability to accurately plan and forecast the delivery of our products to customers and have also increased the total shipping time and cost of ocean freight for components and finished goods moreover industrywide component shortages require our rd teams to focus their attention on manufacturing and production design workarounds solutions which can impact our ability to meet our plans to roll out new innovative products and services additionally a customer of solaredge emobility that has experienced disruptions in its own manufacturing process due to global component shortages has delayed the delivery date of powertrain units that were expected to be supplied by solaredge emobility in the third quarter of 2021 we expect that the aforementioned emobility project to return to normal operations during 2022 

 

despite the operational hurdles detailed above our fourth quarter 2021 revenues of 5519 million reflect an increase from revenues of 5264 million in the third quarter of 2021 

 

 

key components of our results of operations 

 

the following discussion describes certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations 

 

revenues 

 

we generate revenues from the sale of dc optimized inverter systems for solar pv installations which include power optimizers inverters storage and backup solutions ev chargers smart energy devices our cloudbased monitoring platform as well as grid services our customer base mainly includes distributors large solar installers wholesalers epcs and pv module manufacturers in addition we also generate revenues from the sale of lithiumion cells batteries and energy storage solutions ups systems automation machines and ev powertrain solutions for electric vehicles 

 

our revenues from the sale of solarrelated products are affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our dc optimized inverter systems the volume and average selling price of our systems is driven by the supply and demand for our products changes in the product mix between our residential and commercial products the customer mix between large and small customers the geographical mix of our sales sales incentives end user government incentives seasonality and competitive product offerings revenues from the sale of energy storage system or ess products are affected by the type of product sold cell battery or system and the type of the battery that is sold revenues from the sale of ups products solaredge automation machines and solaredge emobility products are affected by the changes in the volumes customers’ size and average selling prices of the products we sell 

 

our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to expand our market share in each of the geographies in which we compete expand our global footprint to new evolving markets grow our production capabilities to meet demand continue to develop and introduce new and innovative products that address the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers and expansion of the new businesses we acquired 

 

in the year ended december 31 2021 454 of our revenues were generated from europe 400 of our revenues were generated from the united states and 146 of our revenues were generated from row in the year ended december 31 2020 429 of our revenues were generated from europe 420 of our revenues were from the united states and 151 of our revenues were generated from row 

 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

 

cost of revenues consists primarily of product costs including purchases from our contract manufacturers and other suppliers as well as costs related to shipping customer support product warranty personnel depreciation of testing and manufacturing equipment hosting services for our cloud based monitoring platform and other logistics services our product costs are affected by technological innovations such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions economies of scale resulting in lower component costs and improvements in production processes and automation some of these costs primarily personnel and depreciation of testing and manufacturing equipment are not directly affected by sales volume 

 

with respect to ess automation machines and emobility products cost of revenues consists primarily of materials costs labor costs associated with the manufacturing variable utility and operational costs related to the manufacturing factories depreciation of testing and manufacturing equipment and other fixed costs 

 

except for the manufacturing and assembly activities related to our acquired businesses and the manufacturing of solar products at sella 1 we outsource our manufacturing to thirdparty manufacturers and negotiate product pricing on a quarterly basis 

 

during 2021 supply chain and operational challenges coupled with an increase in demand for our products resulted in increased use of expedited ocean freight as well as air freight to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner at the beginning of 2021 a high portion of our products manufactured in nontariff countries imported into the us resulted in lower custom tariff charges however disruptions to our vietnam manufacturing facilities due to covid19 restrictions required us to increase manufacturing from our other manufacturing facilities that are subject to custom tariffs in the later part of the year which consequentially caused us to temporarily incur an increase in our tariff charges as a result of the operational challenges we faced during 2021 the levels of our finished goods inventories required to support our growth were reduced therefore we expect to continue to deliver our products through expedited ocean freight and air freight in absence of additional covid19 related shutdowns we expect inventory levels to return to those required to support our growing business and the reduction in expedited shipments and air freight usage during the third quarter of 2022 

 

we continue to develop our own manufacturing capabilities for example we have developed our own proprietary automated assembly lines for our power optimizers manufacture subassemblies such as cables and magnetic and own large amounts of equipment in connection with such manufacturing activities we expect to continue to invest in additional automated assembly lines in the future we have designed and are responsible for funding all of the capital expenses associated with existing and planned automated assembly lines the current and expected capital expenses associated with these automated assembly lines will be funded out of our cash flows generation 

 

key components of our logistics supply channel consist of third party distribution centers in the us europe australia and japan finished goods are either shipped to our customers directly from our contract manufacturers or shipped to thirdparty distribution centers and then finally shipped to our customers 

 

in the third quarter of 2020 we began commercial shipments to the united states of optimizers and inverters from sella 1 which reached full manufacturing capacity in the second quarter of 2021 

 

cost of revenues also includes our operations production and support departments’ costs the operations and production departments are responsible for production management such as planning procurement supply chain production methodologies and machinery planning logistics management and manufacturing support to our contract manufacturers as well as the quality assurance of our products our support department provides customer and technical support at various levels through our call centers around the world as well as second and thirdlevel support services which are provided by support personnel located in our headquarters our employees headcount in our operations production and support departments has grown from 1549 as of december 31 2020 to 2052 as of december 31 2021 

 

gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices product costs product mix customer mix geographical mix shipping method warranty costs and seasonality 

 

operating expenses 

 

operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing general and administrative and other expenses personnel related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories and include salaries benefits payroll taxes commissions and stockbased compensation our employees headcount in our research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative departments has grown from 1625 as of december 31 2020 to 1912 as of december 31 2021 we expect to continue to hire significant numbers of new employees to support our growth the timing of these additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses in any particular period both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue we expect to continue to invest substantial resources to support our growth and anticipate that each of the following categories of operating expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts for the foreseeable future 

 

research and development expenses 

 

research and development expenses include personnelrelated expenses such as salaries benefits stockbased compensation and payroll taxes our research and development employees are engaged in the design and development of power electronics semiconductors software power line communications networking and chemistry our research and development expenses also include thirdparty design and consulting costs materials for testing and evaluation asic development and licensing costs depreciation expense and other indirect costs we devote substantial resources to ongoing research and development programs that focus on enhancements to and cost efficiencies in our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation thereby maintaining our competitive position 

 

sales and marketing expenses 

 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnelrelated expenses such as salaries sales commissions benefits payroll taxes and stockbased compensation these expenses also include travel fees of independent consultants trade shows marketing costs associated with the operation of our sales offices and other indirect costs the expected increase in sales and marketing expenses is due to an expected increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel and the expansion of our global sales and marketing footprint enabling us to increase our penetration into new markets these expenses will be determined to the extent that marketing activities resume contingent upon the recovery of certain activities which have been halted due to covid19 such as travel trade shows and in person customer trainings we currently have a sales presence in many countries worldwide and intend to continue to expand our sales presence to additional regions 

 

general and administrative expenses 

 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits and stockbased compensation related to our executives finance human resources information technology and legal organizations travel expenses facilities costs fees for professional services and registration fees related to being a publiclytraded company professional services consist of audit and legal costs remuneration to board members insurance information technology and other costs general and administrative expenses also include expenses related to legal claims and allowance for doubtful accounts in the event of uncollectible account receivables balances

our functional currency is the us dollar with respect to certain of our subsidiaries the functional currency is the applicable local currency financial expenses income net also consists of gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations primarily of the effect of foreign exchange differences between the us dollar and the new israeli shekel the euro the south korean won and other currencies related to our monetary assets and liabilities the fair value remeasurement of hedging contracts not designated as cash flow hedge and bank charges 

 

income taxes 

 

we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we operate 

 

in the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded a net income tax expense of 233 million which consists of a 268 million current income tax expense and a 35 million deferred tax income in the year ended december 31 2021 we recorded a net income tax expense of 181 million which consists of a 297 million current income tax expense and 116 million of deferred tax income the decrease in net income tax expense was mainly attributed to a tax benefit related to the laps of a statute of limitation of uncertain tax positions and an increase in deferred tax income related to unrealized losses of foreign currency transactions this decrease was partially offset by an increase in tax expense related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries 

 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was signed into law making significant changes to us income tax law these changes include but are not limited to a corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 effective for tax years 2018 onwards and created new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings and certain relatedparty payments 

 

the tax act required the company to pay us income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiaries earnings not previously subject to us income tax at a rate of 155 to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets and 8 on the remaining earnings the total tax liability will be paid over the eightyear period provided in the tax act ending 2024 

 

solaredge technologies ltd our israeli subsidiary is taxed under israeli law income not eligible for benefits under the investments law is taxed at the corporate tax rate the israeli corporate tax rate is 23 

 

our israeli subsidiary elected tax year 2012 as a “year of election” for “benefited enterprise” under the israeli investments law which provides certain benefits including tax exemptions and reduced tax rates upon meeting the requirements under the israeli investments law the twoyear tax exemption has ended on december 31 2018 

 

the investment law was amended in 2005 and was further amended as of january 1 2011 and in august 2013 the “2011 amendment” the 2011 amendment canceled the availability of the benefits granted in accordance with the provisions of the investments law prior to 2011 and instead introduced new benefits for income generated by a “preferred company” through its “preferred enterprise” both as defined in the 2011 amendment under the 2011 amendment income derived by preferred companies from preferred enterprise would be subject to a uniform rate of corporate tax the tax rate applicable to such income referred to as “preferred income” would be 75 in areas in israel that are designated as development zone a and 16 elsewhere in israel starting in the year 2017 and thereafter 

 

in december 2016 amendment 73 to the investments law the “2017 amendment” was published according to the 2017 amendment special tax tracks for technological enterprises have been introduced which are subject to rules that were issued by the israeli ministry of finance a technological preferred enterprise pte as defined in the 2017 amendment that is located in the central region of israel will be subject to tax at a rate of 12 on profits deriving from intellectual property in development zone a  a tax rate of 75 our israeli subsidiary has established its own manufacturing facilities in israel located in a development zone a 

 

on june 14 2017 the encouragement of capital investments regulations preferred technological income and capital gain for technological enterprise 2017 the “regulations” were published the regulations describe inter alia the mechanism used to determine the calculation of the benefits under the pte regime a company that complies with the terms under the pte regime may be entitled to certain tax benefits with respect to certain income generated during the company’s regular course of business and derived from the preferred intangible asset 

 

as of january 2019 our israeli subsidiary elected to implement the 2011 and 2017 amendments starting as of tax year 2019 and as a result under the pte regime with respect to our business activities in israel we expect that it will be entitled to an effective tax at a rate of approximately 12 in 2020 

 

the law for the encouragement of industry taxes 1969 the “industry encouragement law” provides certain tax benefits for an ‘industrial company’ as such term is defined in the industry encouragement law an industrial company is entitled to certain tax benefits including inter alia amortization over an eightyear period of the cost of purchased knowhow and patents and accelerated depreciation rates on equipment and buildings

revenues 

 



 

revenues increased by 5046 million or 346 in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to i an increase in the number of inverters and power optimizers sold with significant growth in revenues in all geographies  and ii an increase in the numbers of powertrain kits supplied by solaredge emobility in an aggregate amount of 555 million revenues from outside of the us comprised 600 of our revenues in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 580 in the year ended december 31 2020 

 

the number of power optimizers recognized as revenues increased by approximately 31 million units or 203 from approximately 155 million units in 2020 to approximately 186 million units in 2021 the number of inverters recognized as revenues increased by approximately 1251 thousand units or 189 from approximately 6633 thousand units in 2020 to approximately 7884 thousand units in 2021 our blended asp per watt for solar products shipped increased by 0024 or 108 in 2021 as compared to 2020 the increase in blended asp per watt is mainly attributed to an increase in the sale of residential products out of our total solar product mix in the us that are characterized with higher asp per watt an increase in the sale of products with enhanced capabilities such as the solaredge energy hub inverter that are characterized with higher asp per watt as well as the appreciation of the euro and other currencies against the us dollar 

 

this increase in blended asp per watt was partially offset by a change in our customer mix in the us toward larger customers that enjoy preferential pricing due to volume commitments

as of december 31 2021 our cash and cash equivalents were 5301 million this amount does not include 6500 million invested in available for sale marketable securities 03 million invested in shortterm restricted bank deposits and 15 million invested in longterm restricted bank deposits our principal uses of cash are for funding our operations capital expenditures other working capital requirements and other investments as of december 31 2021 we have open commitments for capital expenditures in an amount of approximately 1685 million these commitments reflect purchases of automated assembly lines and other machinery related to our manufacturing operations we also have purchase obligations in the amount of 14288 million related to raw materials and commitments for the future manufacturing of our products 

 

we believe that cash provided by operating activities as well as our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months as well as in the longer term including the selffunding of our capital expenditure and operational commitments 

 

 

operating activities 

 

cash provided by operating activities consists of net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities decreased by 85 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 mainly due to unfavorable changes in working capital in 2021 compared to the prior year partially offset by higher net income 

 

investing activities 

 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures investment in sales and maturities of available for sale marketable securities investment and withdrawal of bank deposits and restricted bank deposits and cash used for acquisitions cash used for investing activities increased by 2476 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily driven by a 3557 million increase in purchases of availableforsale debt investments net an increase of 225 million in capital expenditures and an increase of 196 million cash used for asset acquisitions and investments in a privately held company this increase was partially offset by a 904 million decrease in cash used for investment in bank deposits and restricted bank deposits net 

 

financing activities 

 

financing cash flows consist primarily of issuance and repayment of shortterm and longterm debt and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans cash used for financing activities in 2021 was 152 million compared to 6405 million cash provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily due to a 6179 million decrease in cash provided by issuance of the notes net a decrease of 193 million in cash received from the exercise of stockbased awards net of withholding taxes remitted to the tax authorities and an increase of 174 million in bank loans repayments net 

 

convertible senior note 

 

on september 25 2020 we issued 6325 million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes or notes in a transaction exempt from registration pursuant to rule 144a and regulation s under the securities act net proceeds from the offering after underwriters’ discount and commissions and offering expenses was 6179 million we intend to use the proceeds of the notes for general corporate purposes see note 15 to our annual financial statements for more information 

 

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “gaap” the preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain see note 2 to our annual financial statements for more information 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we generate revenues from the sale of dc optimized inverter systems for solar pv installations which include our power optimizers inverters and cloudbased monitoring platform as well as other solar related products ups systems lithiumion cells batteries energy storage solutions ev powertrain solutions and machinery our worldwide customer base includes large solar installers distributors epcs pv module manufacturers utility companies and other customers our products are fully functional at the time of shipment to the customer and do not require production modification or customization with the exception of some ups and ess systems that require installation and commissioning we recognize revenue under the core principle that transfer of control to the customers should be depicted in an amount reflecting the consideration we expect to receive in revenue in order to achieve that core principle we apply the following fivestep approach 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied provisions for rebates sales incentives and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded 

 

we generally sell our products to our customers pursuant to a customer’s standard purchase order and our customary terms and conditions we do not offer rights to return our products other than for normal warranty conditions and as such revenue is recorded upon shipment of products to customers and transfer of title and risk of loss under standard commercial terms we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine that appropriate credit limits are established prior to the acceptance and shipment of an order 

 

we provide our full webbased monitoring platform for our solar products free of charge and revenues associated with the service since that date are being recognized ratably over 25 years in the absence of third party comparable pricing for such service management determines the revenue levels of this service based on the costs associated with providing the service plus appropriate margins that reflect management’s best estimate of the selling price these revenues are minimal and we do not expect this to become a significant source of revenue in the near future 

 

the most significant impact of the standard on our financial statements relates to advance payments received for performance obligations that extend for a period greater than one year applying the standard such performance obligations are those that include a financing component specifically i warranty extension services ii cloudbased monitoring and iii communication services 

 

we recognize financing component expenses in our consolidated statement of income in relation to advance payments for performance obligations that extend for a period greater than one year these financing component expenses are reflected in our deferred revenues balance 

 

see note 2s revenue recognition and note 13 deferred revenues of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information related to revenue recognition 

 

product warranty 

 

we provide a standard limited product warranty for our solar products against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions our standard warranty period is 25 years for our power optimizers 12 years for our inverters 10 years for our storage interface and a 10year limited warranty for our residential energy hub battery other products are sold with standard limited warranties that typically range in duration from one to ten years and in some cases for a longer period in certain cases customers can purchase an extended warranty for critical power products and our battery storage products that exceed the standard warranty period in addition customers can purchase extended warranties for inverters that increase the warranty period to up to 25 years 

 

our products are designed to meet the warranty periods and our reliability procedures cover component selection design accelerated life cycle tests and endofmanufacturing line testing however since our history in selling power optimizers and inverters is substantially shorter than the warranty period the calculation of warranty provisions is inherently uncertain 

 

we accrue for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based on anticipated warranty claims and actual historical warranty claims experience warranty provisions computed on a perunit sold basis are based on our best estimate of such costs and are included in our cost of revenues the warranty obligation is determined based on actual and predicted failure rates of the products cost of replacement and service and delivery costs incurred to correct a product failure our warranty obligation requires management to make assumptions regarding estimated failure rates and replacement costs 

 

in order to predict the failure rate of each of our products we have established a reliability model based on the estimated mean time between failures “mtbf” the mtbf represents the average elapsed time predicted for each product unit between failures during operation applying the mtbf failure rate over our install base for each product type and generation allows us to predict the number of failed units over the warranty period and estimates the costs associated with the product warranty predicted failure rates are updated periodically based on data returned from the field and new product versions as are replacement costs which are updated to reflect changes in our actual production costs for our products subcontractors’ labor costs and actual logistics costs 

 

since the mtbf model does not take into account additional nonsystematic failures such as failures caused by workmanship or manufacturing or designrelated issues and since warranty claims are at times opened for cases in which the error has been triggered by an improper installation we have developed a supplemental model to predict such cases and recognize the associated expenses ratably over the expected claim period this model which is based on actual root cause analysis of returned products identification of the causes of claims and time until each identified problem is revealed allows us to better predict actual warranty expenses and is updated periodically based on our experience taking into account the installed base of approximately 838 million power optimizers and approximately 35 million inverters as of december 31 2021 

 

if actual warranty costs differ significantly from these estimates adjustments may be required in the future which could adversely affect our gross profit and results of operations warranty obligations are classified as shortterm and longterm warranty obligations based on the period in which the warranty is expected to be claimed the warranty provision short and longterm was 2050 million and 2652 million in the year ended december 31 2020 and 2021 respectively 

 

see note 2u warranty obligations and note 12 warranty obligations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information related to product warranty 

 

inventory valuation 

 

our inventories comprise sellable finished goods raw materials bought for own manufacturing or on behalf of our contract manufacturers and faulty units returned under our warranty policy 

 

sellable finished goods and raw material inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based on the moving average cost method certain factors could affect the realizable value of our inventories including market and economic conditions technological changes existing product changes mainly due to cost reduction activities and new product introductions we consider historic usage expected demand anticipated sales price the effect of new product introductions product obsolescence product merchantability and other factors when evaluating the value of inventories inventory writedowns are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and their estimated fair market value inventory writedowns are recorded as cost of revenues in the accompanying statements of income and were 89 million and 71 million in the year ended december 31 2020 and 2021 respectively 

 

faulty products returned under our warranty policy are often refurbished and used as replacement units such products are written off upon receipt 

 

we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions that we use to record inventory at the lower of cost or market however if estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

 

see note 2j inventories and note 4 inventories net of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information related to inventory valuation 

 

business combination 

 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require our management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired technology and other intangible assets their useful lives and discount rates our management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

 

see note 2m business combination of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information related to business combination 

 

intangible and other longlived assets 

 

we evaluate the recoverability of finitelived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any impairment charges during the year ended december 31 2021 

 

acquired identifiable finitelived intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis or accelerated method over the estimated useful lives of the assets we believe the basis of amortization approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized over their estimated useful lives we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of finitelived intangible assets in case we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance is amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life 

 

see note 2n intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information related to intangible assets 

 

goodwill 

 

goodwill reflects the excess of the consideration transferred including the fair value of any contingent consideration and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree over the assigned fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired goodwill is not amortized and is assigned to reporting units and tested for impairment at least on an annual basis 

 

the goodwill impairment test is performed according to the following principles 

 

  

we complete the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for the reporting unit on october 1 of each year and accordingly determines whether goodwill should be impaired during the year ended december 31 2021 no impairment of goodwill has been identified 

 

see note 2o goodwill of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information related to goodwill 

 

income taxes 

 

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 “income taxes” asc 740 which prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 

 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc 74010 twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that on an evaluation of the technical merits the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 cumulative probability likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

 

see note 2ac income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information related to income taxes 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates customer concentrations and interest rates we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

approximately 487 522 and 543 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively were earned in non us dollar denominated currencies principally the euro our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located primarily the us dollar and new israeli shekel nis euro and to a lesser extent the south korean won krw our nis denominated expenses consist primarily of personnel and overhead costs our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 681 million for the year ended december 31 2021 a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the nis and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 244 million for the year ended december 31 2021 a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2021 between the krw and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 196 million for the year ended december 31 2021 

 

for purposes of our consolidated financial statements local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the us dollar on the balance sheet date and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rate as of the date of the transaction or at the average exchange rate to the us dollar during the reporting period 

 

to date we have used derivative financial instruments specifically foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign currency risks by hedging portions of the anticipated payroll payments denominated in nis our foreign currency forward contracts are expected to mitigate exchange rate changes related to the hedged assets those hedging contracts are designated as cash flow hedges 

 

in addition we also entered into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge the company’s exposure to currencies other than the us dollar mainly put and call options to sell euro for us dollars forward contracts to sell aud for us dollars forward contracts to sell euro for us dollars and forward contracts to sell us dollars for krw these derivative instruments are not designated as cash flow hedges 

 

we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of 8271 million and 5301 million at the end of the year ending december 31 2020 and the year ended december 31 2021 respectively which was held for working capital purposes we had availableforsale marketable securities with an estimated fair value of 2911 million and 6500 million on december 31 2020 and december 31 2021 respectively in addition we had bank deposits of 601 million as of december 31 2020 we had restricted bank deposits of 26 million and 19 million as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2021 respectively 

 

additionally our hedging activities may also contribute to increased losses as a result of volatility in foreign currency markets if foreign exchange currency markets continue to be volatile such fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations in future periods also the volatility in the foreign currency markets may make it difficult to hedge our foreign currency exposures effectively 

 

concentrations of major customers 

 

our trade accounts receivables potentially expose us to a concentration of credit risk with our major customers for the year ended december 31 2021 two major customers accounted for 309 of our total revenues and as of december 31 2021 two major customers accounted for approximately 393 of our consolidated trade receivables balance for the year ended december 31 2020 one major customer accounted for 148 of total revenues and as of december 31 2020 two major customers accounted for approximately 346 of our consolidated trade receivables balance we currently do not foresee a credit risk associated with these receivables 

 

commodity price risk 

 

we are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials including copper which are used in our products prices of these raw materials may be affected by supply restrictions or other market factors from time to time and we do not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate commodity risk significant price changes for these raw materials could reduce our operating margins if we are unable to recover such increases from our customers and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

disclosure controls and procedures 

 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of december 31 2021 in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and operating to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

 

management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework management’s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment 

 

based on this assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors 

 

our independent registered public accounting firm kost forer gabbay  kasierer a member of ernst  young global independently assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how welldesigned and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1 business 

introduction 

we are a leading provider of an optimized inverter solution that changed the way power is harvested and managed in photovoltaic also known as pv systems our direct current or dc optimized inverter system maximizes power generation while lowering the cost of energy produced by the pv system for improved return on investment or roi additional benefits of the dc optimized inverter system include comprehensive and advanced safety features improved design flexibility and improved operating and maintenance or om with modulelevel and remote monitoring the typical solaredge optimized inverter system consists of inverters power optimizers a communication device which enables access to a cloud based monitoring platform and in many cases additional smart energy management solutions our solutions address a broad range of solar market segments from residential solar installations to commercial and small utility‑scale solar installations since we began commercial shipments in 2010 we have shipped approximately 224 gigawatts “gw” of our dc optimized inverter systems and our products have been installed in solar pv systems in 133 countries 

since introducing the optimized inverter solution in 2010 solaredge has expanded its activity to other areas of smart energy technology both through organic growth and through acquisitions by leveraging worldclass engineering capabilities and with a relentless focus on innovation solaredge now offers energy solutions which include not only residential commercial and large scale pv systems but also product offerings in the areas of energy storage systems or ess and backup electric vehicle or ev components and charging capabilities home energy management grid services and virtual power plants lithiumion batteries and uninterrupted power supply known as ups solutions 

we primarily sell our products indirectly to thousands of solar installers through large distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers and directly to large solar installers and engineering procurement and construction firms “epcs” our customers include leading providers of solar pv systems to residential and commercial end users key solar distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers as well as several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules 

the pv industry is surveyed by ihs markit an analytics company that ranked solaredge as the top pv inverter supplier worldwide by revenues the top single phase pv inverter supplier worldwide based on megawatt shipments and the top inverter supplier for the residential market worldwide as of their published “ihs pv inverter market tracker  fourth quarter 2020” as of december 31 2020 we have shipped in the aggregate approximately 653 million power optimizers and 27 million inverters more than 19 million pv installations many of which may include multiple inverters are currently connected to and monitored through our cloudbased monitoring platform 

the solaredge solution our dc optimized inverter system maximizes power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system and providing comprehensive and advanced safety features our solution consists of inverters power optimizers a communication device which enables access to our cloudbased monitoring platform and addresses a broad range of solar market segments from residential solar installations to commercial and small utility‑scale solar installations additional smart energy features and hardware that can be added to our solution includes a battery pack for storage of energy and a home energy automation system which enables greater savings for the system owner 

the key advantages of our solution over a traditional string inverter pv system include 

•

maximized pv module power output our power optimizers provide module‑level mpp tracking and real‑time adjustments of current and voltage to the optimal working point of each individual pv module this enables each pv module to continuously produce its maximum power potential independent of other modules in the same string thus minimizing module mismatch and partial shading losses by performing these adjustments at a very high rate our power optimizers also solve the dynamic mpp losses associated with traditional inverters 

•

optimized architecture with economies of scale our system shifts certain functions of the traditional inverter to our power optimizers while keeping the dc to ac function and grid interaction in our inverter as a result our inverter is smaller more efficient more reliable and less expensive than inverters used in traditional inverter systems the cost savings that we have achieved on the inverter enable our system to be priced at a cost per watt that is comparable with traditional inverter systems of leading manufacturers as a pv system grows in size our inverter benefits from economies of scale making our technology viable for large commercial and utility‑scale applications 

•

enhanced system design flexibility unlike a traditional inverter system that requires each string to be the same length use the same type of pv modules and be positioned at the same angle toward the sun our system allows significant design flexibility by enabling the installer to place pv modules in uneven string lengths and on multiple roof facets this design flexibility 

•

increases the amount of the available roof that can be utilized for power production unlike traditional inverter systems our system does not require each string to be the same length use the same type of pv modules or be positioned at the same angle toward the sun as a result our system is significantly less prone to wasted roof space resulting from rooftop asymmetries and obstructions 

•

reduces the number of field change orders for example some installers use remote tools to estimate the size and configuration of an installation in connection with the customer acquisition process this is especially common for high‑volume residential arrays where an exhaustive survey of rooftop obstructions would be uneconomical in some cases installers discover that their preliminary design based on remote tools cannot be implemented due to unexpected shading or other obstructions with traditional inverter system designs an obstructed module may require a significant system redesign and a modification of the customer contract to take into account the changed system design our dc optimized inverter solution enables an installer to compensate or adjust for most obstructions without materially changing the original design or requiring a modification to the customer contract 

•

reduced balance of system costs our dc optimized inverter system allows significantly longer strings to be connected to the same inverter as compared to a traditional inverter system this minimizes the cost of cabling fuse boxes and other ancillary electric components these factors together result in easier installation with shorter design times and a lower initial cost per watt while enabling larger installations per rooftop 

•

continuous monitoring and control to reduce operation and maintenance costs our cloud‑based monitoring platform provides full data visibility at the module level string level inverter level and system level the data can be accessed remotely by any web‑enabled device allowing comprehensive analysis immediate fault detection and alerts these monitoring features reduce om costs for the system owner by identifying and locating faults enabling remote testing and reducing field visits 

•

enhanced safety we have incorporated module‑level safety mechanisms in our system to protect installers electricians and firefighters each power optimizer is configured to reduce output to 1 volt unless the power optimizer receives a fail‑safe signal from a functioning inverter as a result if the inverter is shut down eg for system maintenance due to malfunction in the event of a fire or otherwise the dc voltage throughout the system is reduced to a safe level our dc optimized inverters comply with the applicable safety requirements of the areas in which they are sold providing incremental cost savings to installers by eliminating the need for additional hardware such as dc breakers switches or fire‑proof ducts required by traditional inverter systems in the us the solaredge safedc feature is compliant with nec 2014  nec 2017 rapid shutdown functionality section 69012 solaredge inverters also have a builtin protection designed to mitigate the effects of some arcing faults that may pose a risk of fire in compliance with the ul1699b arc detection standard 

•

high reliability solar pv systems are typically expected to operate for at least 25 years under harsh outdoor conditions high reliability is critical and is facilitated by systems and components that have low heat generation solid and stable materials and an absence of moving parts we have designed our system to meet these stringent requirements our power optimizers dissipate much less heat than microinverters because no dc‑ac inversion occurs at the module level as a result less heat is dissipated beneath the pv module which improves lifetime expectancy and reliability of our power optimizers our power optimizers’ high switching frequency allows the use of ceramic capacitors with a low fixed rate of aging and a proven life expectancy in excess of 25 years further we use automotive‑grade application specific integrated circuits “asics” that embed many of the required electronics into the asic this reduces the number of components and consequently the potential points of failure 

•

energy storage our dc optimized inverter system allows solar energy to be directly stored in batteries without any conversion thereby eliminating energy losses that are associated with such conversions and improving the roi of pv associated battery systems 

•

energy management strategically located at the intersection between pv home usage and the grid inverters are well positioned to act as smart energy managers our smart inverters incorporate the management of pv energy battery storage smart devices and grid interaction by enabling smart energy management in our inverter system owners can not only store solar energy but also control the timing of their pv energy consumption in order to increase their energy independence take advantage of lower timeofuse rates reduce electric bills and improve overall system roi 

•

distributed energy generation as the electric grid transitions from one based on centralized power stations to a network of distributed renewable energy sources our inverter acts as a local control system that can manage the energy resources underlying such distributed network our inverters are a key part of developing a distributed and interactive grid that can help support grid stability one such example is inverterenabled charging and discharging of batteries as part of a virtual power plant to help manage the load on the grid and grid stability 

our pv solar products offering 

solaredge began its commercial sales with a product offering of a simplified inverter power optimizers and cloudbased monitoring platform as the solar energy industry has evolved solaredge has developed innovative solutions to further enhance smart energy technology including inverters that include compatibility with batteries for increased selfconsumption and storage inverters that allow ev charging smart meters smart energy devices sockets water heater controllers wireless relay and smart pv modules this product expansion has enabled us to increase average revenue per installation or arpi 

solaredge power optimizer our dc power optimizer is a highly reliable and efficient dc‑to‑dc converter which is connected by installers to each pv module or embedded by pv module manufacturers into their modules as part of the manufacturing process our power optimizer increases energy output from the pv module to which it is connected by continuously tracking the mpp of each module and controlling its working point the power optimizer’s ability to track the mpp of each pv module and its ability to increase or decrease its output voltage enables the inverter’s input voltage to remain fixed under a large variety of string configurations this feature enhances flexibility in pv system designs enabling use of different string lengths in a single pv system connected to the same inverter use of pv panels situated on multiple orientations connected to the same inverter and using varied pv module types in the same string in addition our power optimizers monitor the performance of each pv module and communicates this data to our inverter using our proprietary power line communication in turn the inverter transmits this information to our monitoring server each power optimizer is equipped with our proprietary safety mechanism which automatically reduces the output voltage of each power optimizer to 1v unless the power optimizer receives a fail‑safe signal from a functioning inverter as a result if the inverter is shut down eg for system maintenance due to malfunction in the event of a fire or otherwise the dc voltage throughout the system is reduced to a safe level 

our power optimizers are designed to withstand high temperatures and harsh environmental conditions and contain multiple bypass features that localize failures and enable continued system operation in the vast majority of cases of power optimizer failure our power optimizers are compatible with the vast majority of modules on the market today and carry a 25‑year product warranty our power optimizers are designed to be used with our inverters to provide power optimization monitoring and safety features can also be achieved with third party inverters by adding supplemental communications hardware during the year ended december 31 2019 and the year ended december 31 2020 revenues derived from the sale of power optimizers represented 445 and 429 of total revenues respectively 

solaredge inverter our dc‑to‑ac inverters contain sophisticated digital control technology with efficient power conversion architecture resulting in superior solar power harvesting and high reliability and are designed to work exclusively with our dc power optimizers a proprietary power line communication receiver is integrated into each inverter receiving data from our power optimizers storing this data and transmitting it to our monitoring server when an internet connection exists since each string which is equipped with our power optimizers provides fixed input voltage to our inverter the inverter is able to operate at its highest efficiency at all times and therefore is more cost‑efficient energy efficient and reliable like our power optimizers our inverters are designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions since the power rating of an inverter determines how many pv modules it can serve larger installations require inverters with higher power ratings we currently offer a single‑phase inverter designed to address the residential market 1 kilowatt “kw” to 114 kw which is based on our hdwave technology and a three‑phase inverter designed to address the residential market in certain european countries and australia as well as the commercial market 4 kw to 100 kw our singlephase inverters support a range of smart energy capabilities in 2020 we launched our energyhub inverter and home backup solution for the us residential market the energyhub contains built in consumption monitoring embedded revenuegrade production metering and integrated arc fault protection and rapid shutdown and is ready for a battery in europe we launched our threephase gridtied inverter with battery storage we also introduced our new commercial threephase 120kw inverter with synergy technology with enhanced power capabilities which is designed to enable quick and easy installation and inventory management for the commercial market the vast majority of our inverters are sold with a 12‑year warranty that is extendable to 20 or 25 years for an additional cost during the year ended december 31 2019 and the year ended december 31 2020 revenues derived from the sale of inverters represented 439 and 440 of total revenues respectively 

ev charging inverter solaredge’s ev charging inverter offers homeowners the ability to charge electric vehicles up to six times faster than a standard level 1 charger through an innovative solar boost mode that utilizes grid and pv charging simultaneously this inverter is the world’s first ev charger with an integrated pv inverter reducing the burden of installing separately a standalone ev charger and a pv inverter the ev charging inverter eliminates the need for additional wiring conduit and a breaker installation by installing an inverter that has an integrated ev charge no additional dedicated circuit breaker is needed saving space and ruling out a potential upgrade to the main distribution panel 

storedge solutions our storedge solution is an ongrid solution that is used to increase energy independence and maximize selfconsumption and backup capabilities for homeowners by utilizing a battery to store and supply solar power as needed the solution is based on a single inverter for both solar pv and storage our storedge solution is designed to provide smart energy functions such as maximizing selfconsumption timeofuse programming for desired hours of the day and home energy backup solutions to optimize selfconsumption the battery is charged and discharged to meet consumption needs and reduce the amount of power purchased from the grid with a backup solution unused solar pv power is stored in a battery and used during a power outage or when solar pv production is insufficient when there is a power outage a combination of solar pv power and battery is used to power important sources such as the refrigerator communication devices lighting and ac outlets our proprietary monitoring platform provides visibility into battery status solar pv production and selfconsumption while offering easy maintenance with remote access to inverter and battery software existing solaredge systems can be upgraded to our storedge solution our storedge inverter with hdwave technology and backup interface is designed to support connection to backup generators or up to three storedge inverters with each inverter dc coupled to two batteries in the first quarter of 2020 we launched a new backup storedge interface that raises available backup power and eliminates predefining loads for simplified energy management 

solaredge software we offer a variety of professional software tools from system design to monitoring 

our “designer platform” is a free webbased tool that helps solar professionals to plan build and validate our residential and commercial systems from inception to installation 

our “mapper app” provides solaredge installers with an efficient streamlined process for registering the physical layout of new pv sites in the solaredge monitoring platform installers use the mapper app to scan solaredge power optimizer and inverter barcodes creating a virtual map of the pv site in the monitoring platform to help facilitate remote diagnostics 

making installations quick and simple our “setapp” is used to activate and configure solaredge inverters during commissioning directly through a smartphone 

in 2020 we launched the mysolaredge application that enables system owners to easily track their realtime system production and household energy consumption as well as view their inverter status for quick troubleshooting from their mobile phones 

our cloud‑based monitoring platform collects power voltage current and system data sent from our inverters and power optimizers and allows users to view the data at the module level string level inverter level and system level from most browsers or from most smart phones and tablets the monitoring software continuously analyzes data and flags potential problems the monitoring software includes features which are used on a routine basis by integrators installers maintenance staff and system owners to improve a solar pv system’s performance by maximizing solar power harvesting and reducing om costs by increasing system up‑time and detecting pv module performance issues more effectively connection to the monitoring server is completed during installation by the installer the installer then receives full access to system data through the monitoring software and can select the amount of data to be shared with the system owner 

smart energy management there are currently two separate energy technology industries that exist today solar energy production and automation technology inverters are taking on an expanded role in energy management and automation and in order to address these market needs we are developing and providing automation products this line of products when used with the solaredge solution is designed to allow system owners to increase selfconsumption by shifting energy usage to match peak solar pv production as well as offer a convenient wireless control option over various building andor home devices an example of this solution would be using excess solar pv energy to heat water or the ability to remotely turn on or off certain power sources such as lighting or electrical appliances the introduction of these products is dependent upon certification and region specific needs and as such these products are not yet available in all of the geographies in which solaredge operates 

grid services as pv and storage continue to proliferate around the world energy production is transitioning from a centralized system to a distributed network model where energy is produced close to the location in which it is consumed and stored this model creates an opportunity for new interconnected and decentralized energy networks offering improved grid reliability and stability new energy services and reduction of grid infrastructure costs solaredge grid services deliver near realtime aggregative control and data reporting enabling the pooling of distributed energy resources such as photovoltaic systems battery storage electric vehicle chargers and loads in the cloud for the creation of virtual power plants the solaredge grid services and vpp solution provides sophisticated management platforms to enable realtime aggregated control of available energy resources to meet everchanging supply needs and demand our distributed energy resources management system or derms application and apis are used by utilities for countering peak demand events in 2020 solaredge generated revenues from selling grid services in the us europe and australia including services provided to independent system operators energy retailers national installers and others 

product roadmap 

our products reflect the innovation focus and capabilities of our technology departments as well as the importance we place on creating value for our customers our core solar product roadmap is divided into five categories power optimizers inverters software energy storage and smart energy management 

power optimizers we currently sell our third generation power optimizer which was designed for fully automated assembly and which is based on our third generation asic a key element of our reliability strategy and a significant differentiator relative to our competitors is our use of proprietary asics to control among other things our power optimizer’s power conversion safety features and pv module monitoring instead of using large numbers of discrete components our power optimizer uses a single proprietary asic thus reducing the total number of components in an electrical circuit and thereby improving reliability in 2021 we expect to launch our fourth generation power optimizer which uses fourth generation asic that will provide higher efficiency and incorporates a new safety mechanism for pv systems including connector level fault detection in addition we are also continuing to develop the necessary subsystems for the fifth generation asic which will be used in our fifth generation power optimizer each new asic generation reduces the number of components required and meaningfully improved the efficiency of the power optimizer the efficiency improvement reduces the energy losses which in turn reduces the amount of heat dissipation this enables design of a more costeffective and usually smaller enclosure and also keeps the electronics cooler thereby improving the power optimizer’s reliability 

inverters our inverter roadmap includes both new products as well as additional capabilities for existing inverters our inverter roadmap is intended to serve three purposes i expand addressable markets by developing new and larger inverters designed specifically for larger commercial installations and utility‑scale projects ii improve the electronics to increase the total power throughput while minimally changing the existing enclosure thereby reducing the actual cost per watt and increasing economies of scale and iii improve ease of installation by integrating additional functionality required in certain installations in order to reduce costs of additional hardware and subcontractors’ labor costs

our technology 

we have drawn on our expertise in the fields of power electronics magnetic design mechanical and heat dissipation capabilities control loops and algorithms and power line communications to design and develop what we believe to be the most advanced commercial solutions for harvesting power from solar pv systems our advanced technologies are explained in more detail below 

as part of our growth strategy we have acquired companies that have technologies that can leverage our expertise in power electronics and power optimization by combining acquired resources with our current research and development teams we are expanding our activity into other essential areas such as emobility battery storage and energy storage systems 

power optimizers 

our power optimizers are dcdc step upstep down buck‑boost converters designed and developed to operate in harsh outdoor environments at very high conversion efficiency our power optimizers include proprietary power electronics customized to efficiently convert power from the pv module to the inverter the components are selected and the conversion topology is designed for the power optimizer specifications and the power optimizer design is verified for consistent performance and reliability in numerous lab tests and simulations 

a key factor in the performance of our power optimizer is determined by the digital control algorithms and closed‑loop control mechanism the power optimizer’s control is built into our advanced asic which is responsible for all critical digital control functions of the power optimizer including detailed power analysis digital control of the power conversion subsystem power line communications and networking since each power optimizer handles the power and voltage of a single module we are able to reach a high degree of semiconductor integration by leveraging low cost silicon in standard semiconductor packages as a result much of the functionality of our power optimizer can be integrated into a standard asic instead of use of discrete electronic components resulting in lower costs and higher reliability 

the asic performs the critical power analysis and power conversion control functions of the power optimizer the power analysis functions process the state and working parameters at the power optimizer’s input and output and together with advanced digital control and state machine logic control the power conversion function in addition our digital control system uses technology that allows the solar pv installation to anticipate and adapt to changing operating conditions and to protect itself against system anomalies 

each power optimizer in the array is connected to the inverter by a power line communications networking link our power line communications link uses a proprietary networking technology that we developed utilizing the existing dc wiring between the power optimizers and the inverter to transmit and receive data between these devices 

inverters 

most of our inverters are designed for single‑stage dcac conversion using our inverter in combination with the power optimizers allows the inverter control loop to maintain a regulated dc voltage level at its input thereby allowing for long uneven and multi‑faceted strings while also enabling custom cost efficient and reliable inverter design and component selection all of the power components as well as the main magnetic components for our inverters can then be optimized for dcac inversion at high efficiency 

our inverters’ digital control algorithms are implemented using programmable digital signal processors which allow for flexibility and adaptation of control loops for various grids and for the requirements and standards of different grid operators across geographies we have already implemented the control mechanisms necessary to support advanced grid codes and standards that are required to support high penetration of solar energy into utility grids in 2020 we developed and manufactured our own dsp asic in our inverters which enables us to improve our control loops increase our cost savings and be less dependent on third party suppliers in our manufacturing process the dsp asic performs the critical power analysis and power conversion control functions of the inverter the power analysis functions process the state and working parameters at the power inverter’s input and output and together with advanced digital control and state machine logic controls the power conversion function in addition our digital control system uses technology that allows the inverter to anticipate and adapt to changing operating conditions and to protect itself against system anomalies as well as comply with applicable regulations in the different regions in which we operate 

our dsp asic is also in charge of the power line communications plc networking link our power line communications link uses a proprietary networking technology that we developed utilizing the existing dc wiring between the power optimizers and the inverter to transmit and receive data between these devices 

we have developed and continue to develop in house design and manufacturing capabilities for magnetic components in order to decrease dependence on suppliers reduce costs and have better control over our production processes 

manufacturing 

we have designed our manufacturing processes to produce high quality products at competitive costs the strategy is threefold outsource automate and localize we currently contract to have our solar products manufactured by two of the world’s leading global electronics manufacturing service providers jabil circuit inc “jabil” and flex ltd “flex” by using contract manufacturers we are able to access advanced manufacturing equipment processes skills and capacity on a “capital light” budget our contract manufacturers are responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products except with regard to endofline testing equipment and other specific manufacturing equipment utilized in assembling our products or subcomponents which are financed and owned by the company we expect to continue this funding arrangement in the future with respect to any expansions to such existing lines further contracting with global providers such as jabil and flex gives us added flexibility to manufacture certain products in china and vietnam closer to target markets in asia and the north american west coast as well as other products in hungary closer to target markets in europe and the north american east coast in each case potentially increasing responsiveness to customers while reducing costs and delivery times in the third quarter of 2020 we began commercial shipments to the us of optimizers and inverters from our manufacturing facility located in the north of israel “sella 1” the proximity of sella 1 to our rd team and labs enables us to accelerate new product development cycles as well as define equipment and manufacturing processes of newly developed products which can then be adopted by our contract manufacturers worldwide we expect sella 1 manufacturing levels to continue to increase until the second quarter of 2021 when we expect sella 1 to reach full manufacturing capabilities 

we have developed propriety automated assembly lines for the manufacturing of our power optimizers these assembly lines currently operating in all of our manufacturing facilities enable the manufacturing of more than 5000 optimizers per machine per day we invest resources in additional automated assembly lines as well as in automated machinery for subassembly and selfmanufacturing of certain components used in our products and we own and are responsible for funding all of the capital expenses related thereto the current and expected capital expenses associated with these automated assembly lines and other machinery is funded out of our cash flows 

we source our raw materials through various component manufacturers and invest resources in continued costreduction efforts as well as verifying second and third sources so as to limit dependence on sole suppliers 

our korean subsidiary kokam has a manufacturing facility for lithiumion cells and batteries that has the capacity to manufacture up to 150 mwh per annum in 2020 we began construction of “sella 2” a 2gwh liion battery factory in korea the new factory is being constructed to meet the growing global demand for liion batteries specifically in the energy storage system ess and emobility markets sella 2 is expected to begin operation in the first half of 2022 

solaredge emobility has a manufacturing and assembly facility in umbertide italy for our emobility division 

reliability and quality control 

our power optimizers are either connected to each pv module by installers or embedded in each pv module by pv module manufacturers our power optimizers are designed to be as reliable as the pv module itself and capable of withstanding the same operating and environmental conditions 

our reliability methodology includes a multi‑level plan with design analysis sub‑system testing of critical components by accelerated life testing and integrative testing of design prototypes by highly accelerated life testing and large sample groups as part of our reliability efforts we subject components to industry standard conditions and tests including in accelerated life chambers that simulate burn‑in thermal cycling damp‑heat and other stresses we also conduct out of box audits oba on our finished products in addition online reliability tests ort are conducted on our optimizers and we test complete products in stress tests and in the field our rigorous testing processes have helped us to develop highly reliable products 

in order to verify the quality of each of our products when it leaves the manufacturing plant each component sub‑assembly and final product are tested multiple times during production these tests include automatic optical inspection in‑circuit testing board‑ functional testing safety testing and integrative stress testing we employ a serial number‑driven manufacturing process auditing and traceability system that allows us to control production line activities verify correct manufacturing processes and to achieve item‑specific traceability 

as a part of our quality and reliability approach failed products from the field are returned and subjected to root cause analysis the results of which are used to improve our product and manufacturing processes and design and further reduce our field failure rate 

certifications 

our products and systems comply with the applicable regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are sold as well as all other major markets around the world these include safety regulations electromagnetic compatibility standards and grid compliance 

research and development 

we devote substantial resources to research and development with the objective of developing new products and systems adding new features to existing products and systems and reducing unit costs of our products and systems our development strategy is to identify features products and systems for both software and hardware that reduce the cost and improve the effectiveness of our solutions for our customers we measure the effectiveness of our research and development by metrics including product unit cost efficiency reliability power output and ease of use 

we have a strong research and development team with wide‑ranging experience in power electronics semiconductors power line communications and networking chemical mechanical and software engineering in addition many members of our team have expertise in solar technologies as of december 31 2020 our research and development organization had a headcount of 904 employees 

intellectual property 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies information processes and know‑how we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws in the us and similar laws in other countries confidentiality agreements and procedures and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology as of december 31 2020 solaredge had 363 issued patents worldwide and 354 patent applications pending for examination a majority of our patents relate to dc power optimization and dc to ac conversion for alternative energy power systems power system monitoring and control battery technology and management systems our issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2021 and 2039 

we continually assess opportunities to seek patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages 

we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests with respect to proprietary know‑how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we believe that many elements of our manufacturing processes involve proprietary know‑how technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes test equipment designs algorithms and procedures 

all of our research and development personnel are required to enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us 

our customers and business partners are required to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans 

competition 

the markets for our solar products are competitive and we compete with manufacturers of traditional inverters as well as manufacturers of other mlpe systems the principal areas in which we compete with other companies include 

•

recent market trends show an increased focus on safety features in rooftop installations and the emergence of standards that are evolving to address such concerns in particular the arc fault detection and interruption afci and rapid shutdown rsd standards in the us market have led to the introduction of modulelevel rapidshutdown devices from our competitors we believe the existence of rapid shutdown capabilities built into our optimizers positions us well in this regard and could serve as a competitive advantage additionally in 2020 we have seen pv module manufacturers introduce larger pv modules with higher power levels reaching over 600w this market trend which comes as a result of pv cell manufacturers introducing larger cell sizes such as m10 and m12 as well as different module build configurations leads to market interest in higher power rating optimizers micro inverters and other mlpe devices the increasing demand for storage and battery solutions is an additional noteworthy market trend which is expected to increase the attachment rate of storage to pv installations in the coming years 

our dc optimized inverter system competes principally with products from traditional inverter manufacturers such as sma solar technology ag abb ltd and huawei technologies co ltd as well as from other chinese inverter manufacturers in the north american residential market we compete with traditional inverter manufacturers as well as microinverter manufacturers such as enphase energy inc in addition several new entrants to the mlpe market including low‑cost asian manufacturers have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped similar products we believe that our dc optimized inverter system offers significant technology and cost advantages that reflect a competitive differentiation over traditional inverter systems and microinverter technologies 

the markets for our lithiumion products are competitive as well and we compete with global cell and battery manufacturers in the ess market our energy storage solutions compete with products from global manufactures such as lg chem samsung sdi byd and panasonic 

in the ups market our ups products compete with products and solutions from global ups providers such as schneider electric eaton and vertiv 

the vehicle emobility component market is dominated primarily by manufacturers such as robert bosch gmbh zf friedrichshafen ag dana incorporated and magna international as the global emobility market expands major automotive manufacturers such as toyota honda tesla general motors and ford have increased their investments in the electric and hybrid vehicle components in order to increase their market share 

government incentives 

us federal state and local government bodies as well as nonus government bodies provide incentives to owners end users distributors and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates tax credits lower vat rate and other financial incentives such as system performance payments payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar pv systems from property tax assessments the market for on‑grid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of these government subsidies and economic incentives which vary from time to time by geographic market and 

import tariffs 

escalating trade tensions between the united states and china have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions including tariffs applicable to some of our products as of june 2019 the us trade representative “ustr” imposed import tariffs of 25 on a long list of products imported from china including inverters and power optimizers on january 15 2020 the united states and china entered into an initial trade deal which preserves the 2018 tariffs and indicates additional sanctions may be imposed if china breaches the terms of the deal 

in order to mitigate the negative effect of increased tariffs we increased our manufacturing capabilities at our vietnam manufacturing facility beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 and throughout 2020 we also began manufacturing in sella 1 as of december 31 2020 the majority of our products being imported to the us are manufactured in vietnam israel and hungary and are therefore not subject to the aforementioned tariffs 

seasonality 

the solar energy market is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations affected by weather for example during the winter months in europe and the northeastern us where the climate is particularly cold and snowy it is typical to see a decline in pv installations and this decline can impact the timing of orders for our products 

sustainable responsible and transparent business practices

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our business and our industry 

we cannot be certain that we will sustain our current level of profitability in the future 

we achieved a net profit of  1450 million and 1403 million in the years ended december 31 2019 and 2020 respectively our revenue and profitability for the year ended december 31 st  2020 did not grow as we previously anticipated mainly due to the adverse effects of covid19 on demands for our products and on the global economy in general furthermore in the future our revenues from both solar and nonsolar business may not grow at the pace we anticipate or may decline for a number of reasons many of which are outside our control including a decline in demand for our products increased competition a decrease in the growth of the solar industry the short term and long term effects of covid19 on our industry and business or our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities if we fail to maintain sufficient revenue to support our operations we may not be able to sustain profitability 

in addition we expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business including in connection with recent or future acquisitions as well as ongoing marketing and developing our products development of our own manufacturing facilities expanding into new product markets and geographies maintaining and enhancing our research and development operations and hiring additional personnel we do not know whether our revenues will grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs or the extent of these expenses or their impact on our results of operations 

the rapidly evolving and competitive nature of the solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects our entry into other adjacent markets through recent acquisitions is new and highly competitive and it is difficult to evaluate our future in these new markets as well 

the rapidly evolving and competitive nature of the solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects in addition we have limited insight into emerging trends that may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects our nonsolar businesses in adjacent markets such as upss battery and emobility are new to us and these are highly competitive markets in which we will need to compete we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries including unpredictable and volatile revenues and increased expenses as we continue to grow our business the viability and demand for our products may be affected by many factors outside of our control including 

•

cost competitiveness reliability and performance of solar pv systems compared to conventional and nonsolar renewable energy sources and products 

•

availability and amount of government subsidies and incentives to support the development and deployment of solar energy solutions 

•

the extent to which the electric power industry and broader energy industries are deregulated to permit broader adoption of solar electricity generation 

•

prices of traditional carbonbased energy sources 

•

levels of investment by endusers of solar energy products which tend to decrease when economic growth slows and 

•

the emergence continuance or success of or increased government support for other alternative energy generation technologies and products 

if demand for solar energy solutions does not continue to grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our business and results of operations will suffer 

our revenues are primarily derived from products utilized in solar pv installations thus our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years and we cannot be certain that consumers businesses or utilities will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to grow our business if demand for solar energy solutions fails to develop sufficiently demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business 

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid or other renewable energy resources would make the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and would likely lower sales of our products the price of electricity derived from the utility grid could decrease as a result of 

•

construction of a significant number of new power generation plants including plants utilizing natural gas nuclear coal renewable energy or other generation technologies 

•

relief of transmission constraints that enable local centers to generate energy less expensively 

•

reductions in the price of natural gas or alternative energy resources other than solar 

•

utility rate adjustment and customer class cost reallocation 

•

energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce electricity consumption 

•

development of smartgrid technologies that lower the peak energy requirements of a utility generation facility 

•

development of new or lowercost energy storage technologies that have the ability to reduce a customer’s average cost of electricity by shifting load to offpeak times and 

•

development of new energy generation technologies that provide less expensive energy 

moreover technological developments in the solar components industry could allow our competitors and their customers to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be achieved by us and our customers which could result in reduced demand for our products if the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations incorporating our systems is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a solar pv system and could reduce the demand for smart energy products and thus demand for our products 

many endusers depend on financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build or purchase a solar pv system as a result an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or the endusers to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a solar pv system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our products which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of endusers install solar pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through financing an increase in interest rates could lower such enduser’s return on investment on a solar pv system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar pv systems and in each case could cause such endusers to seek alternative investments furthermore the continuous effects of covid19 on the economy may influence the endusers willingness to invest in solar pv systems to our detriment both due to endusers’ economic uncertainly as well as the market’s unwillingness to extend favorable financial terms to the endusers 

the market for our products is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce power optimizers inverters solar pv system monitoring and other smart energy products which could negatively affect our results of operations and market share 

the market for solar pv solutions is highly competitive we principally compete with traditional inverter manufacturers as well as microinverter manufacturers currently our dc optimized inverter system competes with products from traditional inverter manufacturers and microinverter manufacturers as well as emerging technology companies offering alternative mlpe products over the past few years several new entrants to the inverter and mlpe market including lowcost asian manufacturers have announced plans to ship or have already shipped products in markets in which we sell our products including with respect to sales in australia and in europe we expect competition to intensify as new and existing competitors enter the market in addition there are several new entrants that are proposing solution to the rapid shutdown functionality which has become a regulatory requirement for pv rooftop solar systems in the united states if these new technologies are successful in offering a price competitive and technological attractive solution to the residential solar pv market this could make it more difficult for us to maintain market share 

several of our existing and potential competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices for our products in order to compete effectively if we have to reduce our prices by more than we anticipated or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer 

in addition competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than us may partner with other competitors to provide combined technologies and competing solutions and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours 

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may have a material adverse effect on demand for our offerings 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advances in other forms of distributed solar pv power generation storage solutions such as batteries the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could result in product obsolescence the loss of competitiveness of our products decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors 

the solar industry has historically been cyclical and experienced periodic downturns 

our future success partly depends on continued demand for solar pv systems in the endmarkets we serve including the residential and commercial sectors in the united states and europe the solar industry has historically been cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns which may affect the demand for equipment that we manufacture the solar industry has undergone challenging business conditions in past years including downward pricing pressure for pv modules mainly as a result of overproduction and reductions in applicable governmental subsidies contributing to demand decreases therefore there is no assurance that the solar industry will not suffer significant downturns in the future which will adversely affect demand for our solar products and our results of operations 

defects or performance problems in our products could result in loss of customers reputational damage and decreased revenue and we may face warranty indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products 

although our products meet our stringent quality requirements they may contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new generations are released errors defects or poor performance can arise due to design flaws defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties which can affect both the quality and the yield of the product any actual or perceived errors defects or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products or components thereof shipment delays rejection of our products damage to our reputation lost revenue diversion of our personnel from our product development efforts and increases in customer service and support costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore defective components may give rise to warranty indemnity or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive from the affected products in most cases we offer a minimum 12year limited warranty for our inverters extendable to twenty five years for an additional cost and a 25year limited warranty for our power optimizers our limited warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship of our products under normal use and service conditions as a result we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold products and recognized revenue while we do have accrued reserves for warranty claims our estimated warranty costs for previously sold products may change to the extent future products are not compatible with earlier generation products under warranty our warranty accruals are based on our assumptions and we do not have a long history of making such assumptions as a result these assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our systems causing us to incur substantial unanticipated expense to repair or replace defective products in the future or to compensate customers for defective products our failure to accurately predict future claims could result in unexpected volatility in and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

if one of our products were to cause injury to someone or cause property damage then we could be exposed to product liability claims we could incur significant costs and liabilities if we are sued and if damages are awarded against us further any product liability claim we face could be expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention the successful assertion of a product liability claim against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages penalties or fines subject us to adverse publicity damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely affect sales of our products in addition product liability claims injuries defects or other problems experienced by other companies in the residential solar industry could lead to unfavorable market conditions for the industry as a whole 

we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers 

while we are manufacturing a small portion of our products in israel we still heavily rely upon our contract manufacturers to manufacture most of our products we mainly rely on two contract manufacturers any change in our relationship or contractual terms with our contract manufacturers or changes in our contract manufacturers’ ability to comply with their contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs even though we have commenced manufacturing in our facility in israel the expected production volumes will not be sufficient to relieve our significant dependence on our contract manufacturers in addition we will remain heavily dependent on suppliers of the components needed for our manufacturing 

the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues as a result fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner especially in light of restrictions imposed by covid 19 in addition the facilities in which our products are manufactured are located outside of the us currently in china vietnam israel and hungary the location of these facilities outside of key markets such as the us increases shipping time thereby causing a long lead time between manufacturing and delivery 

if either of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers which may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers or increase our shipping costs to make up for delays in manufacturing which in turn could reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers subject us to liquidated damages for late deliveries and damage our reputation with local installers and potential endusers all of which will cause us to forego potential revenue opportunities further the ramp of a new contract manufacturer is time consuming and draining on the resources of our operations team 

we may experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations 

our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise involving a number of precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be identified and properly rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques andor expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased warranty reserve increased costs and delays any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for key components and raw materials in our products to adequately meet anticipated demand due to the limited number of such suppliers any changes or shortages in raw materials or key components we use could result in sales delays higher costs associated with air shipments cancellations and loss of market share 

we depend on limited or single source suppliers for certain key components and raw materials used to manufacture our products making us susceptible to quality issues shortages and price changes any of these limited or single source suppliers could stop supplying or offering at commercially reasonable prices our components or raw materials cease operations or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors because there are a few suppliers of raw materials used to manufacture our products it may be difficult to timely identify andor qualify alternate suppliers on commercially reasonable terms therefore our ability to satisfy customer demand may be adversely affected transitioning to a new supplier or redesigning a product to accommodate a new component manufacturer would result in additional costs and delays these outcomes could harm our business or financial performance 

managing our supplier and contractor relationships is particularly difficult when we are introducing new products for example as we begin to ramp assembly and production of powertrain kits for the automotive industry we are heavily reliant on third party suppliers that need to be approved through rigorous testing and validation processes for use in our supply chain once selected it is timely and costly to replace such vendors 

any interruption in the supply of limited source components or raw materials for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers could result in lost revenue or higher expenses associated with increased air shipments required to meet customer demand in a timely manner and would harm our business for example we expect raw material shortages due to increased lead time which may affect our ability to timely receive certain components within the previously expected lead times these shortages may result in a delay in sales higher costs associated with air shipments cancellations and loss of market share 

we rely on distributors and large installers to assist in selling our products and the failure of these customers to perform as expected could reduce our future revenues 

for the year ended december 31 2020 our largest customer was consolidated electrical distributors inc or ced accounted for 148 of our revenues our next five largest customers for the year ended december 31 2020 together accounted for 307 of our revenues our customers’ decisions to purchase our products are influenced by a number of factors outside of our control the agreements we have with some of our largest customers do not have longterm purchase commitments and are generally cancellable by either party after a relatively short notice period the loss of or events affecting one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we do not have exclusive arrangements with our third party distributors and large installers many of our distributors and large installers also market and sell products from our competitors these distributors and large installers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and with little or no notice further these distributors and large installers may fail to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors termination of agreements with current distributors or large installers failure by these distributors or large installers to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new distributor or large installer relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and results of operations 

mergers in the solar industry among our current or potential customers may adversely affect our competitive position  

there has been an increase in consolidation activity among distributors large installers and other strategic partners in the solar industry for example in october 2020 sunrun a leading provider of residential solar battery storage and energy services acquired vivint solar if this consolidation continues it will further increase our reliance on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales and may negatively impact our competitive position in the solar market 

our planned expansion into new geographic markets or new product lines or services could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks 

we have in the past and may in the future evaluate opportunities to expand into new geographic markets and introduce new product offerings and services we also may from time to time engage in acquisitions of businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen and expand our market position our technological capabilities or provide synergy opportunities for example we intend to continue to introduce new products targeted at large commercial and utilityscale installations and to continue to expand into other international markets 

our success operating in these new markets or in operating any acquired business will depend on a number of factors including our ability to develop solutions to address the requirements of the large commercial and utilityscale solar pv markets timely certification of new products for large commercial and utilityscale solar pv installations acceptance of power optimizers in solar pv markets in which they have not traditionally been used our ability to manage increased manufacturing capacity and production and to identify and integrate any acquired businesses 

further we expect these new solar pv markets and the additional markets we have entered to have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products and our success will depend on our ability to adapt properly to these differences these differences include differing regulatory requirements including tax laws trade laws labor regulations tariffs export quotas customs duties or other trade restrictions limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection international political or economic conditions restrictions on the repatriation of earnings longer sales cycles warranty expectations product return policies and cost performance and compatibility requirements in addition expanding into new geographic markets will increase our exposure to presently existing risks such as fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and difficulties and increased expenses in complying with us and foreign laws regulations and trade standards including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” 

failure to develop and introduce these new products successfully to successfully integrate acquired businesses or to otherwise manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to sustain profitability 

if we fail to build our nonsolar businesses and future growth effectively we may be unable to execute our business plan maintain high levels of customer service or adequately address competitive challenges 

we have experienced significant growth in recent periods with our annual product sales growing rapidly from approximately 152500 inverters and approximately 36 million power optimizers in the fiscal year ending june 30 2015 to annual product sales exceeding 663000 inverters and 155 million power optimizers in the year ended december 31 2020 we intend to continue to expand our business significantly within existing and new markets this growth has placed and any future growth may place a significant strain on our management operational and financial infrastructure in particular we will be required to expand train and manage our growing employee base and scale and otherwise improve our it infrastructure in tandem with that headcount growth our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers as well as manage multiple geographic locations 

our current and planned operations personnel customer support it information systems and other systems and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth and may require us to make additional unanticipated investment in our infrastructure our success and ability to further scale our business will depend in part on our ability to manage these changes in an efficient manner if we cannot manage our growth we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures this could also result in declines in quality or customer satisfaction increased costs difficulties in introducing new offerings or other operational difficulties any failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our business and reputation 

conversely the global pandemic and resulting economic downturn in many regions requires our ability to be flexible and decrease expenses where growth has slowed down while we had anticipated 2020 to yield a more rapid level of growth and profitability we had to rapidly adjust to the effects of covid19 by reducing the ramp rate of our manufacturing slow down hiring plans and in some cases put on hold certain plans for growth and development our ability to react quickly to market conditions is not always in our control and any inability to do so could also adversely impact our business 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversion of our convertible senior notes or notes in cash or to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion of the notes or to repurchase the notes 

holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indentures governing their respective notes at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid special interest if any in addition upon conversion of the notes unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of notes surrendered or notes being converted in addition our ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the notes may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing such notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes as required by such indenture would constitute a default under such indenture a default under the indenture governing the notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness if the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversion of the notes 

any unauthorized access to disclosure or theft of personal information we gather store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation 

our business and operations may be impacted by data security breaches and cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to confidential data we receive store and use certain personal information of our customers and the endusers of our customers’ solar pv systems we also store and use personal information of our employees we take steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the personal information we process however we have been subject to cybersecurity attacks and other information technology system disruptions in the past and there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized access use or disclosure will not occur despite our efforts because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we and our suppliers or vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures 

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee or contractor error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business particularly in light of the european general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act which came into effect january 1 2020 if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information were to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

third parties our employees or our vendors might gain unauthorized access to our network or seek to compromise our products and services 

from time to time we face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet introduce malicious software to our information technology it systems or corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide we or our products may be a target of computer hackers organizations or malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products employees and customers or interrupt our systems or those of our customers or others furthermore we are susceptible to similar attempts by our own employees or vendors who have access to our networks from time to time we encounter intrusions or attempts at gaining unauthorized access to our network to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations however there can be no guarantee that such impacts will not be material in the future while we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network and products and to prevent their recurrence where practicable we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats in addition to intentional thirdparty cybersecurity breaches the integrity and confidentiality of company and customer data may be compromised as a result of human error product defects or technological failures cybersecurity breaches whether successful or unsuccessful and other it system interruptions including those resulting from human error and technological failures could result in our incurring significant costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems reduced inventory value providing modifications to our products and services defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties 

our entry into business engagements with military bodies as our customers in the lithiumion battery and energy storage business embodies a risk for potentially largescale and uncapped liability 

as a result of the acquisition of kokam we sell a small portion of our products to military customers our sales to military customers often involve standard form contracts which may not be subject to negotiation in particular certain of these contracts involve unlimited damages provisions that could result in largescale liabilities 

our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments in particular we may not succeed in future acquisitions or be effective in integrating such acquisitions 

as part of our growth strategy we have made a number of acquisitions and may continue to make acquisitions and investments in the future we frequently evaluate the tactical or strategic opportunities available related to complementary businesses products or technologies there can be no assurance that we will be successful in making additional acquisitions even if we are successful in making additional acquisitions integrating an acquired company’s business into ours or investing in new technologies may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and large expenditures and absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business both of which may result in the loss of key customers or personnel and expose us to unanticipated liabilities further we may not be able to retain the key employees that may be necessary to operate the businesses we acquire and we may not be able to attract in a timely manner new skilled employees and management to replace them 

we may not be able to consummate acquisitions or investments that we have identified as crucial to the implementation of our strategy for other commercial or economic reasons further we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals including those of competition authorities and foreign investment authorities in countries where we seek to consummate acquisitions or make investments for those and other reasons we may ultimately fail to consummate an acquisition even if we announce the intended acquisition 

lithiumion used in our battery cells and packs can potentially catch fire or vent smoke and cause damage or injury 

the battery cells and packs produced by our subsidiary kokam and the solaredge home battery which is expected to launch during the second quarter of 2021 make use of lithiumion cells we regularly test our products and take safety measures when manufacturing selling and installing battery cells and packs however due to the high energy density of lithiumion cells mishandling inappropriate storage noncompliance with safety instructions or field failures can potentially cause a battery cell to rapidly release its stored energy which may in turn cause a thermal event that can ignite nearby materials including other lithiumion cells as the use of lithiumion batteries becomes more widespread these events may occur more often causing damage to property injury lawsuits and adverse publicity which may adversely affect our reputation results of operations or financial condition 

conditions in israel affect our operations and may limit our ability to develop produce and sell our products 

our headquarters and research and development center are located in israel accordingly political economic and military conditions in israel directly affect us israel has been involved in a number of armed conflicts and is the target of terrorist activity ongoing state of hostility varying in degree such as rocket fire from the gaza strip has occurred on an irregular basis disrupting daytoday civilian activity and negatively affecting business conditions israel also faces threats from hezbollah militants in lebanon iranian militia in syria and others we cannot predict whether or when such armed conflicts or attacks may occur or the extent to which such events may impact us any future armed conflict political instability or violence in the region may impede our ability to manage our business effectively operate our manufacturing plant in northern israel to engage in research and development or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations in the event of war we may be forced to cease operations which may cause delays in the distribution and sale of our products some of our directors executive officers and employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and are subject to being called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances in the event that our principal executive office is damaged as a result of hostile action or hostilities otherwise disrupting the ongoing operation of our offices our ability to operate could be materially adversely affected 

additionally several countries principally in the middle east restrict doing business with israeli companies and additional countries and groups may impose similar restrictions if hostilities in israel or political instability in the region continue or increase if instability in neighboring states results in the establishment of fundamentalist islamic regimes or governments more hostile to israel or if egypt turkey or jordan abrogates its respective peace treaty with israel israel could be subject to additional political economic and military confines and our operations and ability to sell our products to countries in the region could be materially adversely affected 

any hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners or significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the tax benefits that are available to us under israeli law require us to meet various conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future which could increase our costs and taxes 

our israeli subsidiary was eligible for certain tax benefits provided to “benefited enterprises” under the israeli law for the encouragement of capital investments 1959 the “investments law” beginning in january 2019 and with respect to its taxable results from 2019 onwards our israeli subsidiary further elected to apply the terms of the investments law as per “preferred enterprise” “pe” or “preferred technological enterprise” “pte” in order to remain eligible for the tax benefits for “benefited enterprises” with respect to our israeli subsidiary’s taxable results until 2018 and with respect to its taxable results from 2019 for pe or pte we must continue to meet certain conditions stipulated in the investments law and its regulations as amended if these tax benefits are reduced cancelled or discontinued our israeli taxable income would be subject to regular israeli corporate tax rates and we may be required to refund any tax benefits that we have already received plus interest and penalties thereon the statutory corporate tax rate for israeli companies is 23 as of january 1 2018 and onward additionally if we increase our activities outside of israel through acquisitions or otherwise through our israeli subsidiary our existing or expanded activities might not be eligible for inclusion in existing or future israeli tax benefit programs the israeli government may furthermore independently determine to reduce phase out or eliminate entirely the benefit programs under the investments law regardless of whether we then qualify for benefits under those programs at the time which would also adversely affect our global tax rate and our results of operations 

it may be difficult to enforce a judgment of a us court against our officers and directors to assert us securities laws claims in israel or to serve process on our officers and directors 

the majority of our directors and executive officers their assets and most of our assets are located outside of the us consequently a judgment obtained against any of these persons including a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws may not be collectible in the us it also may be difficult to effect service of process on these persons in the us or to assert us securities law claims in original actions instituted in israel israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of us securities laws on the grounds of forum non conveniens  in addition even if an israeli court hears a claim it may determine that israeli law and not us law is applicable to the claim if us law is found to be applicable the content of applicable us law must be proven as a fact by expert witnesses which can be a lengthy and costly process further an israeli court may not enforce a judgment awarded by a us or other nonisraeli court certain matters of procedure will also be governed by israeli law there is little binding case law in israel that addresses these matters as a result of the difficulty associated with enforcing a judgment against any of these persons in israel judgment against many of our directors and executive officers may be unachievable or unenforceable 

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may have a material adverse effect on demand for our offerings 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advances in other forms of distributed solar pv power generation storage solutions such as batteries the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could result in product obsolescence the loss of competitiveness of our products decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors 

risks related to legal compliance and regulations 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business 

federal state local and foreign government bodies provide incentives to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates tax credits or exemptions and other financial incentives the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives because our customers’ sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the desirability of solar electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business for example in 2015 the us congress passed a multiyear extension to the solar investment tax credit itc such extension helped grow the us solar market as of january 1 2021 the itc is reduced from 30 percent to 26 percent for both residential and commercial projects and is expected to reach 10 percent for commercial projects in 2024 the reduction in the itc could reduce the demand for solar energy solutions in the us which would have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore due to the continued economic downturn from covid19 many of the institutions utilizing itc may significantly pull back or no longer have the ability to invest meaning that financing for solar projects may become seriously diminished 

in general subsidies and incentives may expire on a particular date end when the allocated funding is reduced or terminated due to inter alia  legal challenges adoption of new statutes or regulations or the passage of time these reductions or terminations often occur without warning 

in addition several jurisdictions have adopted renewable portfolio standards mandating that a certain portion of electricity delivered by utilities to customers come from a set of eligible renewable energy resources such as solar by a certain compliance date under some programs a utility can receive a “credit” for renewable energy produced by a third party by either purchasing the electricity directly from the producer or paying a fee to obtain the right to renewable energy generated but used or sold by the generator a renewable energy credit allows the utility to add this electricity to its renewable portfolio requirement without actually expending the capital for generating facilities however there can be no assurances that such policies will continue reduction or elimination of renewable portfolio standards or successful efforts to meet current standards could harm or halt the growth of the solar pv industry and our business 

changes to net metering policies may reduce demand for electricity from solar pv systems and harm our business 

our business benefits from favorable net metering policies in most us states and some european countries net metering allows a solar pv system owner to pay his or her electric utility only for power usage net of production from the solar pv system system owners receive credit for the energy that the solar installation generates to offset energy usage at times when the solar installation is not generating energy under a net metering program the customer typically pays for the net energy used or receives a credit against future bills if more energy is produced than consumed 

most us states have adopted some form of net metering yet net metering programs have recently come under regulatory scrutiny in some us states due to allegations that net metering policies inequitably shift costs onto nonsolar ratepayers by allowing solar ratepayers to sell electricity at rates that are too high for utilities to recoup their fixed costs for example in 2019 louisiana public service commissions adopted net metering policies aiming at lowering the solar customers’ savings we cannot assure you that the programs will not be significantly modified going forward 

if the value of the credit that customers receive for net metering is reduced endusers may be unable to recognize the current level of cost savings associated with net metering the absence of favorable net metering policies or of net metering entirely or the imposition of new charges that only or disproportionately affect endusers that use net metering would significantly limit demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future growth 

existing electric utility industry regulations and changes to regulations may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar pv systems that may significantly reduce demand for our products or harm our ability to compete 

federal state local and foreign government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry and internal policies and regulations promulgated by electric utilities heavily influence the market for electricity generation products and services these regulations and policies could deter purchases of solar pv systems sold by our customers significantly reducing the potential demand for our products for example utilities commonly charge fees to larger industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for backup purposes these fees could increase the cost to use solar pv systems sold by our customers and make them less desirable thereby harming our business prospects financial condition and results of operations in addition depending on the region electricity generated by solar pv systems competes most effectively with expensive peakhour electricity from the electric grid rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the utilities’ peak hour pricing policies or rate design such as to a flat rate could require the price of solar pv systems and their component parts to be lower in order to compete with the price of electricity from the electric grid 

changes in current laws or regulations applicable to us or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the us europe or other jurisdictions in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations any changes to government or internal utility regulations and policies that favor electric utilities could reduce the competitiveness of solar pv systems sold by our customers and cause a significant reduction in demand for our products and services in addition changes in our products or changes in export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

general risks 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our operations and financial results 

the covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our supply chain operations and customer demand as a result of the covid19 pandemic governmental authorities worldwide have imposed mandatory closures stayathome orders and social distancing protocols that significantly limit the movement of people goods and services or otherwise restrict normal business operations or consumption patterns our compliance with these measures has disrupted and depending on the duration of such measures may continue to disrupt our business and operations as well as that of our key customers and suppliers for an indefinite period of time additionally to support the health and wellbeing of our employees our work force has had to spend a significant amount of time working remotely which has impacted our daytoday operations our ability to meet customers and create future sales and business opportunities the covid19 pandemic has resulted in slower growth and demand for our products and may continue to impact our revenues in the following quarters mainly contingent on the duration of the global economic downturn in addition since the outbreak and the restrictions on travel our employees and management have been unable to travel to customers manufacturing facilities and to suppliers our marketing activities exhibitions and shows have also been cancelled or postponed or have been held virtually 

the full extent the effects covid19 will have on our business depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to currently accurately predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic the effect on our customers and customer demand for our products disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work and travel availability and longterm effectiveness of covid19 vaccination especially in light of its recent mutation which has made the virus exponentially more contagious 

more generally the covid19 pandemic raises the possibility of an extended global economic downturn and has caused volatility in financial markets which may continue to adversely affect demand for our products and could adversely affect our results and financial condition in subsequent quarters for example some of our customers could potentially experience financial difficulties which in turn could make it difficult for us to collect receivables as well as cause a decrease in the demand for our products which could negatively affect our revenues additionally some of our suppliers may experience delivery delays or financial difficulties which could result in supply constraints and increased costs or delays to our productions 

the unprecedented and continuously evolving nature of the covid19 other pandemics or epidemics could also have the effect of amplifying many of the other risks described in this item 1a risk factors  

we are dependent on ocean transportation to deliver our products in a cost efficient manner if we are unable to use ocean transportation to deliver our products our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 

we rely on ocean transportation for the delivery of the majority of our products to our customers we also rely on more expensive air transportation when ocean transportation is not available or compatible with the delivery time requirements of our customers or when we are unable to meet the growing volume demands of our customers and need to accelerate delivery times our ability to deliver our products via ocean transportation could be adversely impacted by shortages in available cargo capacity changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling pricing payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel taxes and labor disruptions to ports and other shipping facilities as a result of the covid19 or other epidemics and other factors not within our control if we are unable to use ocean transportation and are required to substitute more expensive air transportation our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

although our financial results are reported in us dollars 522 of our revenues in the year ended december 31 2020 were generated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition a significant portion of our operating expenses are accrued in new israeli shekels primarily related to payroll the euro and to a lesser extent the korean won and other currencies as detailed in the foreign currency exchange risk under item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and to a lesser extent the new israeli shekel korean won and other currencies in which we generate revenues incur expenses and maintain cash balances foreign currency fluctuations may also affect the prices of our products which are denominated primarily in us dollars if there is a devaluation of a particular currency the prices of our products will increase relative to the local currency and may be less competitive despite our efforts to minimize foreign currency risks primarily by maintaining cash balances in new israeli shekels significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values in particular a significant change in the relative values of the euro and new israeli shekel korean won and other currencies against the us dollar could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition 

from time to time we may enter into forward contracts to hedge the exchange impacts on assets and liabilities denominated in israeli shekels euros and other currencies as of december 31 2020 we have used derivative financial instruments to hedge the company’s exposure to currencies other than the us dollar mainly put and call options to sell euro for us dollars and put and call options to sell australian dollars “aud” for us dollars forward contracts to sell aud for us dollars forward contracts to sell euro for us dollars and forward contracts to sell us dollars for south korean won “krw” these derivative instruments are not designated as cash flow hedges 

additionally our hedging activities may also contribute to increased losses as a result of volatility in foreign currency markets if foreign exchange currency markets continue to be volatile such fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations in future periods also the volatility in the foreign currency markets may make it difficult to hedge our foreign currency exposures effectively 

risks related to intellectual property 

if we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and unfair competition laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions with our customers suppliers employees and others to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our ability to enforce these rights is subject to litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we may be subject to claims that our ip rights are invalid or not enforceable our assertion of ip rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us which could harm our business our inability to enforce our ip rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and business 

we have applied for patents in the us europe and china some of which have been issued we cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology and any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to among other things rebrand or redesign our affected products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the us we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated infringed or otherwise violated 

our intellectual property may be stolen or infringed upon in fact as further detailed in item 3 – “legal proceedings” we are engaged in a number of legal proceedings related to intellectual property litigation proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings may occur including monetary damages or injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products or requiring other remedies these lawsuits are intended to protect our significant investment in our intellectual property but they also may consume management and financial resources for long periods of time and may not result in favorable outcome for us which may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert management’s attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate 

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry from time to time we may also be subject to claims of intellectual property right infringement and related litigation and as we gain greater recognition in the market we face a higher risk of being the subject of claims of violation of others’ intellectual property rights for example in may 2019 we were served with three lawsuits by huawei technologies co ltd a chinese entity “huawei” against our two chinese subsidiaries and our equipment manufacturer in china the lawsuits filed in the guangzhou intellectual property court alleged infringement of three patents and asked for an injunction of manufacture use sale and offer for sale and damages in august 2020 a firstinstance judgment was issued ordering the three defendants to collectively pay damages in the amount of approximately 155 million including court fees with respect of one of the patents and we have filed an appeal with the supreme people’s court the judgement is not enforceable until a final judgement of the higher courts is available in addition in february 2020 a preliminary injunction was rendered by the guangzhou intellectual property court applying to seven inverter models in line with the court’s mandate solaredge took immediate action to make software changes to meet the court order and also appealed the decision 

although we are certain that we have meritorious defenses to the claims responding to such claims can be time consuming divert management’s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses in litigation or settlement while we believe that our products and technology do not infringe in any material respect upon any valid intellectual property rights of third parties we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims if we do not successfully defend or settle an intellectual property claim we could be liable for significant monetary damages and could be prohibited from continuing to use certain technology business methods content or brands to avoid a prohibition we could seek a license from the applicable third party which could require us to pay significant royalties increasing our operating expenses if a license is not available at all or not available on reasonable terms we may be required to develop or license a nonviolating alternative either of which could require significant effort and expense if we cannot license or develop a nonviolating alternative we could be forced to modify limit or in extreme cases stop manufacturing and sales of our offerings in the relevant country and may be unable to effectively compete any of these results could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees which could result in litigation and adversely affect our business 

we enter into agreements with our employees pursuant to which they agree that any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement are assigned to us or owned exclusively by us depending on the jurisdiction without the employee retaining any rights a significant portion of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees in the course of their employment for us under the israeli patent law 57271967 the “patent law” inventions conceived by an employee during the scope of his or her employment with a company are regarded as “service inventions” which belong to the employer absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer giving the employee service invention rights the patent law also provides that if there is no such agreement between an employer and an employee the israeli compensation and royalties committee the “committee” a body constituted under the patent law shall determine whether the employee is entitled to remuneration for his or her inventions case law clarifies that the right to receive consideration for “service inventions” can be waived by the employee and that in certain circumstances such waiver does not necessarily have to be explicit the committee will examine on a casebycase basis the general contractual framework between the parties using interpretation rules of the general israeli contract laws further the committee has not yet determined the method for calculating this committeeenforced remuneration  but rather uses the criteria specified in the patent law although our employees have agreed that any rights related to their inventions are owned exclusively by us we may face claims demanding remuneration in consideration for such acknowledgement as a consequence of such claims we could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to our current andor former employees or be forced to litigate such claims which could negatively affect our business 

if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected 

due to our latest acquisitions goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 2083 million or approximately 85 of our total assets as of december 31 2020 we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment and we assess on an asneeded basis whether there have been impairments in our other intangible assets we make assumptions and estimates in this assessment which are complex and often subjective these assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts to the extent that the factors described above change we could be required to record additional noncash impairment charges in the future which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to the ownership of our common stock 

we cannot assure you that our stock price will not decline or not be subject to significant volatility 

shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in march 2015 at a price of 1800 per share and during the year ended december 31 2020 the reported high and low prices of our common stock ranged from 6702 to 3358 per share as further detailed in the performance graph in item 5 below the price of our common stock in 2020 was highly volatile and may fluctuate in response to our results of operations in future periods or due to other factors including factors specific to companies in our industry many of which are beyond our control as a result our share price may experience significant volatility and may not necessarily reflect the value of our expected performance among other factors that could affect our stock price are 

• 

the addition or loss of significant customers 

• 

changes in laws or regulations applicable to our industry products or services 

• 

speculation about our business in the press or the investment community 

• 

price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market 

• 

volatility in the market price and trading volume of companies in our industry or companies that investors consider comparable 

• 

share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading levels of our shares

• 

tax developments in the us europe or other markets 

•

conversion of all or portion of the notes 

• 

strategic actions by us or our competitors such as acquisitions or restructurings and 

• 

changes in accounting principles 

further the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of affected companies in addition the stock prices of many renewable energy companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions changes in us regulations and policies with respect to renewable energy  interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial cost and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may believe advantageous these provisions include 

• 

authorizing “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt 

•

in addition we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” which generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder becomes an “interested” stockholder 

our certificate of incorporation includes a forum selection clause which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us 

our certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder including any beneficial owner to bring i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or employees to us or to our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or iv any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine will be a state court located within the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware in all cases subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions this forum selection provision may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us it is also possible that notwithstanding the forum selection clause that is included in our certificate of incorporation a court outside of delaware could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in june and july 2018 we filed three lawsuits for patent infringement against huawei technologies co ltd a chinese entity huawei technologies düsseldorf gmbh a german entity and wattkraft solar gmbh a german distributor for huawei the lawsuits filed in the mannheim district court in germany assert unauthorized use of patented technology and are intended to protect solaredge’s significant investment in its innovative dc optimized inverter technology seeking monetary damages an injunction and recall of infringing huawei inverters and optimizers from the german market the lawsuit is intended to prevent the defendants from selling any multilevel inverters and optimizers infringing upon solaredge’s pv inverter and optimizer technology protected in the asserted patents in germany in november 2019 one of the patents underlying one of the lawsuits was revoked by the european patent office and as such the relevant parallel infringement proceedings have been stayed in march of 2020 solaredge appealed this decision of the european patent office in the other two lawsuits hearings were held and in one of the proceedings the claim was dismissed and we have appealed to a higher court in the parallel nullity proceedings regarding this patent a hearing has been held but no decision has been rendered the third lawsuit is pending a court appointed expert opinion we intend to continue to vigorously fight to protect our patented technology 

in may 2019 we were served with three lawsuits by huawei technologies co ltd a chinese entity “huawei” against our two chinese subsidiaries and our equipment manufacturer in china the lawsuits filed in the guangzhou intellectual property court alleged infringement of three patents and asked for an injunction of manufacture use sale and offer for sale and damage awards a firstinstance judgment was issued on august 7 2020 ordering the three defendants to collectively pay damages in the amount of approximately 16 million including court fees with respect of one of the patents we appealed this judgement with the supreme people’s court the first instance court’s judgement is not effective or enforceable pending the appeal in addition in january 2021 huawei filed a motion to increase its claimed monetary damages to approximately 76 million and for a preliminary injunction with respect to the second lawsuit in february 2021 a preliminary injunction was rendered by the guangzhou intellectual property court with respect to a second lawsuit and applying to seven inverter models in line with the court’s mandate we took immediate action to make software changes to meet the court order and also appealed the decision we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted by huawei 

in september 2018 our german subsidiary solaredge technologies gmbh received a complaint filed by a competitor sma solar technology ag “sma” the complaint filed in the district court düsseldorf germany alleges that solaredges 125kw  276kw inverters infringe two of plaintiff’s patents in its complaints sma requests inter alia an injunction rendering account about past sales a recall of products and a determination for a claim for damages for sales in germany sma asserted a value in dispute of 55 million euros approximately 67 million for both patents we challenged the validity of both patents in december 2019 the district court of düsseldorf found one of the two patents to be infringed and we appealed this decision to the appeals court düsseldorf in the parallel nullity proceedings regarding this patent in october 2020 the german patent court rendered the sma patent invalid this invalidity has been appealed by sma due to the invalidity proceedings the infringement proceedings regarding this patent have been stayed with respect to the other patent in november 2019 the first instance court stayed the infringement proceedings since it considered it to be highly likely that the patent would also be invalid we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit 

in addition in the normal course of business we may from time to time be named as a party to various legal claims actions and complaints including as a result of initiating such legal claims action or complaints on behalf of the company it is impossible to predict with certainty whether any resulting liability would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the sections of this annual report on form 10k captioned “selected financial data” and “business” and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form 10k in addition to historical financial information the following discussion and analysis contains forward‑looking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward‑looking statements as a result of many factors including those discussed under the sections of this annual report captioned “special note regarding forward‑looking statements” and “risk factors” for discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for the year december 31 2018 refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 27 2020 

overview 

we develop manufacture and sell products that address a broad range of energy market segments through our diversified product offering including residential commercial and large scale photovoltaic or pv energy storage and backup solutions electric vehicle or ev charging home energy management grid services and virtual power plants as well as products in our nonsolar businesses which address emobility automation machines lithiumion cells and battery packs and ups solutions 

further information regarding our business is provided in “part i item 1 business” of this annual report 

in the year ended december 31 2020 one customer accounted for 148 of our revenues and our top three customers all distributors together represented 295 of our revenues 

our revenues were 14257 million and 14593 million for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 respectively gross margins were 336 and 316 for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 respectively net profits were 1465 million and 1403 million for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 respectively 

performance measures 

in managing our business and assessing financial performance we supplement the information provided by the financial statements with other operating metrics these operating metrics are utilized by our management to evaluate our business measure our performance identify trends affecting our business and formulate projections we use metrics relating to yearly shipments inverters shipped power optimizers shipped and megawatts shipped to evaluate our sales performance and to track market acceptance of our products from year to year we use metrics relating to monitoring systems monitored and megawatts monitored to evaluate market acceptance of our products and usage of our solution 

we provide the “megawatts shipped” metric which is calculated based on nameplate capacity shipped to show adoption of our system on a nameplate capacity basis nameplate capacity shipped is the maximum rated power output capacity of an inverter and corresponds to our financial results in that higher total capacities shipped are generally associated with higher total revenues however revenues increase with each additional unit sold not necessarily each additional mw of capacity sold accordingly we also provide the “inverters shipped” and “power optimizers shipped” operating metrics 

covid19 impact  response 

we continue to monitor the evolving impact of covid19 on our operations and business our first priority continues to be to protect and support our employees while maintaining company operations and support of our customers with as few disruptions as possible we follow the guidance issued by applicable local authorities and health officials in each region in which we do business including in our headquarters located in israel and have been able to continue our operations remotely or from our offices we have maintained a flexible attendance policy that has allowed our employees to work remotely where possible in order to reduce the number of people who are in our offices while our labs and manufacturing facilities remain fully operational our manufacturing facilities in korea italy and israel as well as our contract manufacturers facilities in china vietnam and hungary have remained operational and at almost full capacity with brief interruptions on a case by case basis in compliance with local laws our customer support centers are working at full capacity primarily from home our operations and operating expenses have not been significantly impacted by these adjustments continued travel restrictions however have had an impact on our operations including by way of example delays in third party testing and certification of new products 

the actions taken around the world to slow the spread of covid19 have impacted the installation rate of pv systems which we are closely tracking through our monitoring portal globally and per country we saw and reported a decline in installations in certain regions such as the united states and italy beginning with the covid19 outbreak in march 2020 that negatively impacted our revenues in the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 when compared to the first quarter of 2020 in certain cases we accommodated customers in certain regions who requested to cancel or delay the supply of their orders 

we have taken actions in order to mitigate the negative impacts of covid19 on our business operating results and financial condition in the second quarter of 2020 we adjusted our original precovid19 business plans to implement substantial reductions of new hiring elimination of redundant positions reduction where possible of our spending management of operations including a review of all of our variable research and development projects as well as a voluntary reduction of the base salariescompensation of our executives and board members the impact of these reductions is reflected in our 2020 yearend financial results overall despite our ability to mitigate some of the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic by reducing manufacturing levels and lowering expenses our revenues net profitability and the overall market grew less than we had anticipated 

as anticipated our fourth quarter revenues of 3581 million an increase from revenues of 3381 million in the third quarter of 2020 reflect continuous improvement in installation rates in the us and rest of world which were slightly decreased in europe due to typical seasonality experienced in europe during the winter during the fourth quarter of 2020 many of our customers depleted existing accumulated inventory from previous quarters and we saw an increase in demand resulting in higher quarterly revenues mainly from our us based customers 

key components of our results of operations 

the following discussion describes certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations 

revenues 

we generate revenues from the sale of dc optimized inverter systems for solar pv installations which include power optimizers inverters ev chargers smart energy devices our cloud‑based monitoring platform as well as grid services our customer base mainly includes distributors large solar installers wholesalers epcs and pv module manufacturers in addition we also generate revenues from the sale of lithiumion cells batteries and energy storage solutions ups systems automation machines and ev powertrain solutions for electric vehicles 

our revenues from the sale of solarrelated products are affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our dc optimized inverter systems the volume and average selling price of our systems is driven by the supply and demand for our products changes in the product mix between our residential and commercial products the customer mix between large and small customers the geographical mix of our sales sales incentives end‑user government incentives seasonality and competitive product offerings revenues from the sale of energy storage system or ess products are affected by the type of product sold cell battery or system and the type of the battery that is sold revenues from the sale of ups products solaredge automation machines and solaredge emobility products are affected by the changes in the volumes customers’ size and average selling prices of the products we sell 

our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to expand our market share in each of the geographies in which we compete expand our global footprint to new evolving markets grow our production capabilities to meet demand continue to develop and introduce new and innovative products that address the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers and expansion of the new businesses we acquired 

in the year ended december 31 2020 429 of our revenues were generated from europe 420 of our revenues were generated from the united states and 151 of our revenues are generated from row in the year ended december 31 2019 382 of our revenues were generated from europe 476 of our revenues are generated from the united states and 142 of our revenues were generated from row 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues consists primarily of product costs including purchases from our contract manufacturers and other suppliers as well as costs related to shipping customer support product warranty personnel depreciation of test and manufacturing equipment hosting services for our cloud‑based monitoring platform and other logistics services our product costs are affected by technological innovations such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions economies of scale resulting in lower component costs and improvements in production processes and automation some of these costs primarily personnel and depreciation of test and manufacturing equipment are not directly affected by sales volume 

with respect to ess automation machines and emobility products cost of revenues consists primarily of materials costs labor costs associated with the manufacturing variable utility and operational costs related to the manufacturing factories depreciation of testing and manufacturing equipment and other fixed costs 

except for the manufacturing and assembly activities related to our acquired businesses and the manufacturing of solar products at sella 1 we outsource our manufacturing to third‑party manufacturers and negotiate product pricing on a quarterly basis 

in fiscal 2020 the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and increased inventory levels due to a decrease in demand as a result of covid19 enabled us to use ocean freight rather than previously used air freight to deliver the majority of our products in addition a higher portion of our products manufactured in nontariff countries imported into the us resulted in lower custom tariff charges we anticipate maintaining inventory levels in 2021 to support our growth continuing to deliver our products through ocean freight and reducing us customs tariffs exposure on imported products 

we continue to develop our own manufacturing capabilities for example we have developed our own proprietary automated assembly lines for our power optimizers manufacture subassemblies such as cables and magnetics and own large amounts of equipment in connection with such manufacturing activities we expect to continue to invest in additional automated assembly lines in the future we have designed and are responsible for funding all of the capital expenses associated with existing and planned automated assembly lines the current and expected capital expenses associated with these automated assembly lines will be funded out of our cash flows generation 

key components of our logistics supply channel consist of third party distribution centers in the us europe australia and japan finished goods are either shipped to our customers directly from our contract manufacturers or shipped to thirdparty distribution centers and then finally shipped to our customers 

in the third quarter of 2020 we began commercial shipments to the united states of optimizers and inverters from sella 1 which is expected to reach full manufacturing capabilities in the second quarter of 2021 

cost of revenues also includes our operations production and support departments’ costs the operations and production departments are responsible for production management such as planning procurement supply chain production methodologies and machinery planning logistics management and manufacturing support to our contract manufacturers as well as the quality assurance of our products our support department provides customer and technical support at various levels through our call centers around the world as well as second and thirdlevel support services which are provided by support personnel located in our headquarters our full‑time employee headcount in our operations production and support departments has grown from 1031 as of december 31 2019 to 1549 as of december 31 2020 

gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices product costs product mix customer mix geographical mix shipping method warranty costs and seasonality 

operating expenses 

operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing general and administrative and other expenses personnel‑related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories and include salaries benefits payroll taxes commissions and stock‑based compensation our full‑time employee headcount in our research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative departments has grown from 1400 as of december 31 2019 to 1625 as of december 31 2020 we expect to continue to hire significant numbers of new employees to support our growth the timing of these additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses in any particular period both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue we expect to continue to invest substantial resources to support our growth and anticipate that each of the following categories of operating expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts for the foreseeable future 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses include personnel‑related expenses such as salaries benefits stock‑based compensation and payroll taxes our research and development employees are engaged in the design and development of power electronics semiconductors software power line communications networking and chemistry our research and development expenses also include third‑party design and consulting costs materials for testing and evaluation asic development and licensing costs depreciation expense and other indirect costs we devote substantial resources to ongoing research and development programs that focus on enhancements to and cost efficiencies in our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation thereby maintaining our competitive position 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel‑related expenses such as salaries sales commissions benefits payroll taxes and stock‑based compensation these expenses also include travel fees of independent consultants trade shows marketing costs associated with the operation of our sales offices and other indirect costs the expected increase in sales and marketing expenses is due to an expected increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel and the expansion of our global sales and marketing footprint enabling us to increase our penetration into new markets these expenses will be determined to the extent that marketing activities resume contingent upon the recovery of certain activities which have been halted due to covid19 such as travel trade shows and in person customer trainings we currently have a sales presence in many countries worldwide and intend to continue to expand our sales presence to additional regions 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits and stock‑based compensation related to our executives finance human resources information technology and legal organizations travel expenses facilities costs fees for professional services and registration fees related to being a publiclytraded company professional services consist of audit and legal costs remuneration to board members insurance information technology and other costs general and administrative expenses also include allowance for doubtful accounts in the event of uncollectable account receivables balances

our functional currency is the us dollar with respect to certain of our subsidiaries the functional currency is the applicable local currency financial expenses net is net of financial income which consists primarily of the effect of foreign exchange differences between the us dollar and the new israeli shekel the euro the korean won and other currencies related to our monetary assets and liabilities and the realization of gains or losses from hedging transactions 

taxes on income 

we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we operate 

in the year ended december 31 2019 we recorded net income tax expenses of 67 million for federal and state tax in the us which consists of 101 million current income tax expenses and 34 million deferred tax benefit in the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded net income tax expenses of 46 million for federal and state tax in the united states which consists of 18 million current income tax expenses and 28 million deferred tax expenses the decrease in tax liability was mainly due to lower taxable income for federal tax and global intangible lowtaxed income or gilti tax 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” was signed into law making significant changes to us income tax law these changes include but are not limited to a corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 effective for tax years 2018 onwards created new tax liability on certain foreignsourced earnings and certain relatedparty payments due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the tax act we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2017 as we collected and prepared necessary data and interpreted the additional guidance issued by the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies we made adjustments over the course of 2018 to the provisional amounts including refinements to deferred taxes the accounting for the tax effects of the tax act was completed as of december 31 2018 

the tax act required us to pay us income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to us income tax at a rate of 155 to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets and 8 on the remaining earnings the company has elected to pay its transition tax over an eightyear period as provided in the tax act 

solaredge technologies ltd our israeli subsidiary is taxed under israeli law income not eligible for benefits under the investments law is taxed at the corporate tax rate the israeli corporate tax rate is 23 

our israeli subsidiary elected tax year 2012 as a “year of election” for “benefited enterprise” under the israeli investments law which provides certain benefits including tax exemptions and reduced tax rates upon meeting the requirements under the israeli investments law income derived from productive activity under the benefited enterprise status would subject to certain terms and limits will be exempt from tax for two years from the year in which the israeli subsidiary first generated taxable income since the israeli subsidiary utilized all of its carryforwards losses in the six months ended on december 31 2016 and was granted an approval by the israeli tax authorities “ita” in this regard the twoyear tax exemption has ended on december 31 2018 

the investment law was amended in 2005 and was further amended as of january 1 2011 and in august 2013 the “2011 amendment” the 2011 amendment canceled the availability of the benefits granted in accordance with the provisions of the investments law prior to 2011 and instead introduced new benefits for income generated by a “preferred company” through its “preferred enterprise” both as defined in the 2011 amendment under the 2011 amendment income derived by preferred companies from preferred enterprise would be subject to a uniform rate of corporate tax for an unlimited period as opposed to the incentives prior to the 2011 amendment that were limited to income from approved or benefited enterprise during the respective benefits period according to the 2011 amendment considering the rates as amended in the 2017 amendment as defined herein the tax rate applicable to such income referred to as “preferred income” would be 75 in areas in israel that are designated as development zone a and 16 elsewhere in israel in the year 2017 and thereafter under the transitional provisions of the 2011 amendment companies may elect to irrevocably implement the 2011 amendment while waiving benefits provided under the legislation prior to the 2011 amendment or keep implementing the legislation prior to the 2011 amendment 

in december 2016 amendment 73 to the investments law the “2017 amendment” was published according to the 2017 amendment special tax tracks for technological enterprises have been introduced which are subject to rules that were issued by the israeli ministry of finance a technological preferred enterprise as defined in the 2017 amendment that is located in the central region of israel will be subject to tax at a rate of 12 on profits deriving from intellectual property in development zone a  a tax rate of 75 our israeli subsidiary has established its own manufacturing facilities for inverters and optimizers in israel located in a development zone a 

on june 14 2017 the encouragement of capital investments regulations preferred technological income and capital gain for technological enterprise 2017 the “regulations” were published the regulations describe inter alia the mechanism used to determine the calculation of the benefits under the pte regime and determine certain requirements relating to documentation of intellectual property for the purpose of the pte according to these provisions a company that complies with the terms under the pte regime may be entitled to certain tax benefits with respect to certain income generated during the company’s regular course of business and derived from the preferred intangible asset as determined in the investments law excluding certain portion of income as prescribed therein 

as of january 2019 our israeli subsidiary elected to implement the 2011 and 2017 amendments starting as of tax year 2019 and as a result under the pte regime with respect to our business activities in israel we expect that it will be entitled to an effective tax at a rate of approximately 12 in 2020 

the law for the encouragement of industry taxes 1969 the “industry encouragement law” provides certain tax benefits for an ‘industrial company’ as such term is defined in the industry encouragement law an industrial company is entitled to certain tax benefits including inter alia i amortization over an eightyear period of the cost of purchased knowhow and patents and rights to use a patent and knowhow which are used for the development or advancement of the company and ii accelerated depreciation rates on equipment and buildings eligibility for benefits under the industry encouragement law is not subject to receipt of prior approval from any governmental authority we believe that our israeli subsidiary currently qualifies as an industrial company however there can be no assurance that it will continue to so qualify or that the benefits described above will be available to it in the future furthermore the ita may determine that we do not qualify as an industrial company which could entail a loss of the benefits that relate to that status 

israeli tax law section 20a of the tax ordinance allows under certain conditions a tax deduction for certain research and development expenses as prescribed in the tax ordinance for the year in which they are paid subject to appropriate approval by the relevant israeli government ministry determined by the field of research expenses incurred in scientific research that are not approved by the relevant israeli government ministry will be deductible over a threeyear period commencing from the tax year in which they are paid to date our israeli subsidiary has not obtained such approval 

results of operations 

the following tables set forth our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2020 we have derived this data from our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this this annual report the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period 

comparison of year ended december 31 2020 and year ended december 31 2019 

 

revenues 

 

revenues increased by 336 million or 24 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to i an increase of 991 million in sales generated from europe and the rest of worldii an increased proportion of solar related products and services iii price increases on products sold in the united states intended to offset the increase in tariffs on china made products imposed in june 2019 this increase was partially offset by 655 million less sales in the united states compared to 2019 which we attribute principally to the negative impact of the covid19 pandemic on the economy in the united states revenues from outside of the us comprised 580 of our revenues in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 524 in the year ended december 31 2019 

the number of power optimizers recognized as revenues decreased by approximately 02 million units or 17 from approximately 157 million units in 2019 to approximately 155 million units in 2020 the number of inverters recognized as revenues decreased by approximately 1000 units or 02 from approximately 664000 units in 2019 to approximately 663000 units in 2020 our blended asp per watt for solar products shipped decreased by 0018 or 75 in 2020 as compared to 2019 this reduction in both product units and blended asp is primarily attributed to higher revenues from the sale of commercial products mainly in the us that are characterized with lower asp per watt as well as a change in our customer mix in the united states toward larger customers that enjoy preferable pricing this asp erosion was partially offset by an increased rate of revenues driven from the sale of residential products mainly in europe that are characterized with higher asp per watt as well as the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar 

in our solar business we expect that revenues in the first quarter of 2021 will increase in the united states this increase is expected to be slightly offset by decrease in revenues in europe due to seasonality which is typically experienced in europe during the first quarter of the year in addition we expect an increase in overall revenues from the sale of full powertrain kits and batteries to an automotive manufacturer by solaredge emobility which is part of our nonsolar business 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

 

cost of revenues increased by 516 million or 55 in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to 

• 

an increase in warranty expenses and warranty accruals of 86 million associated primarily with an increase of products in our install base this increase was partially offset by various cost reductions on the different elements of our warranty expenses which include the cost of the products shipment and other related expenses 

• 

an increase in other production costs of 327 million which is mainly attributed to changes in raw material inventory valuations related to manufacturing volumes anticipated future use of such raw materials and inventory writeoffs in addition this amount includes 13 million related to ramp up costs associated with the commencement of production in our sella 1 manufacturing facility and 29 million related to the ramp of manufacturing in solaredge emobility and 

•

an increase in personnelrelated costs of 58 million related to the expansion of our production operations and support headcount which grew in parallel to our growing install base worldwide and in connection with entering into the machinery and integrated powertrain markets 

these increases were partially offset by 

• 

a slight decrease in the volume of products sold and 

•

a decrease in shipment and logistic costs of 120 million mainly attributed to a decrease in air shipment costs resulted from higher inventory levels 

in our solar business we anticipate that our cost of revenues per unit will remain stable in the first quarter of 2021 

gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 336 in 2019 to 316 in 2020 as a result of the above detailed analysis 

we expect that gross margin as a percent of revenues will increase in the first quarter of 2021 compared to that of the fourth quarter of 2020 

in light of the uncertain impact of covid19 on the rate of growth of our acquired businesses accounting estimates and assumptions related to goodwill intangible and other assets may change over time in response to uncertain circumstances related to this evolving situation such changes could result in future impairments of goodwill intangible and other assets 

operating expenses 

research and development 

 

research and development costs increased by 418 million or 344 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to 

• 

an increase in personnelrelated costs of 300 million resulting from an increase in our research and development headcount as well as salary expenses associated with employee equitybased compensation the increase in headcount reflects our continuing investment in enhancements of existing products as well as research and development expenses associated with bringing new products to the market and 

• 

increased expenses related to consultants and sub‑contractors in an amount of 85 million 

we expect that our research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2021 will slightly increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily due to the expected return to growth trajectory and our continued investment in our nonsolar businesses 

sales and marketing 

 

sales and marketing expenses increased by 80 million or 91 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to increased personnelrelated costs of 118 million as a result of an increase in headcount supporting our growth in israel and rest of world as well as salary expenses associated with employee equitybased compensation 

these were partially offset by 

• 

a decrease in expenses related to marketing activities by 25 million due to the cancellation or postponement of marketing activities exhibitions and shows which changes were triggered by covid19 and 

• 

decreased expenses related to travel in an amount of 32 million 

we expect sales and marketing expenses to slightly decrease in the first quarter of 2021 primarily due to lower salary expenses associated with employee equitybased compensation partially offset by an increase in our sales and marketing headcount 

general and administrative 

 

general and administrative expenses increased by 138 million or 279 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to 

• 

increased personnelrelated costs of 82 million resulting from an increase in headcount due to hiring of senior executives and the expansion of ga functions in the nonsolar businesses as well as salary expenses associated with employee equitybased compensation and 

• 

increased provision of 41 million in connection with legal claims 

we expect that in the first quarter of 2021 ga expenses will continue to increase as a result of senior management expansion and the roll back of certain covid19 measures 

other operating income expenses 

 

other operating income was 34 million in 2020 compared to other operating expenses of 307 million in 2019 primarily due to 

•

a decrease in expenses in the amount of 83 million related to payroll bonus and employees’ equitybased compensation acceleration incurred in 2019 due to the untimely death of mr guy sella our founder who had served as ceo and chairman of the board of directors until shortly before his passing 

•

a decrease in expenses in the amount of 122 million related to compensation expenses incurred in 2019 resulting from a modification in psu terms originally granted as part of the acquisition of solaredge automation machines  this modification was part of a separation agreement with a former solaredge automation machines executive 

•

a decrease in expenses in the amount of 53 million related to the sale of a solaredge emobility subsidiary originally acquired as part of the solaredge automation machines acquisition and 

•

a decrease in expenses in the amount of 49 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to an acquired legal claim as part of the kokam acquisition of which was settled in arbitration for 49 million in the first quarter of 2020 

these were partially offset by 15 million expenses related to writeoffs of identifiable intangible assets in solaredge emobility which we ceased to use during 2020 

financial expenses income net 

 

financial income was 211 million in 2020 compared to financial expenses of 113 million in 2019 primarily due to an increase of 431 million in financial income resulted from foreign exchange fluctuations mainly between each of the euro the new israeli shekel the australian dollar and the south korean won against the us dollar 

the increase in this income was partially offset by 

•

an increase of 40 million in costs related to hedging transactions in 2020 

•

a decrease of 37 million in interest income and accretion amortization of discount premium on marketable securities and 

•

an increase of 32 million related to the accretion of the debt discount and amortization of debt issuance cost associated with our notes due 2025 

taxes on income 

 

taxes on income decreased by 103 million or 306 in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to 

• 

a decrease of 106 million of current tax expenses mainly attributed to a decrease in taxable income and gilti taxes both due to higher deductible expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 and 

•

a decrease in previous years taxes of 23 million 

this decrease was partially offset by a decrease of 26 million in deferred tax assets net 

net income 

 

as a result of the factors discussed above net income decreased by 46 million or 32 in 2020 as compared to 2019 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table shows our cash flows from operating activities investing activities and financing activities for the stated periods 

 

as of december 31 2020 our cash and cash equivalents were 8271 million this amount does not include 2911 million invested in available for sale marketable securities 26 million invested in restricted bank deposits and 601 million invested in shortterm bank deposits our principal uses of cash are for funding our operations and other working capital requirements as of december 31 2020 we have open commitments for capital expenditures in an amount of approximately 794 million these commitments reflect purchases of automated assembly lines and other machinery related to our manufacturing operations we also have purchase obligations in the amount of 3801 million related to raw materials and commitments for the future manufacturing of our products we believe that cash provided by operating activities as well as our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months including the selffunding of our capital expenditure commitments 

we expect cash flow from operating activities to continue and increase in the next quarter due to increased revenues and profitability this cash in addition to the cash balances already exist is sufficient to meet the company’s entire operational and capital needs 

operating activities 

during 2020 cash provided by operating activities was 2227 million derived mainly from net income of 1403 million that included 1034 million of noncash expenses a decrease of 865 million in trade receivables an increase of 116 million in accrued expenses and other accounts payable 323 million in warranty obligations 183 million accruals for employees 33 million in trade payables and 14 million in operating lease liabilities this was offset by an increase of 1497 million in inventories and 33 million in prepaid expenses and other accounts receivable and a decrease of 214 million in deferred revenues

financing activities 

during 2020 net cash provided by financing activities was 6405 million of which 6325 million were proceeds from the issuance of the notes net of 146 million of issuance costs 169 million related to proceeds from new bank loans and 215 million attributed to cash received from the exercise of employee and nonemployee stockbased awards including withholding taxes effect this was offset by 158 million used for repayment of loans we acquired as part of the kokam acquisition 

during 2019 net cash used in financing activities was 730 million of which 715 million was related to the purchase of noncontrolling interests 92 million was used for repayment of loans we acquired as part of the acquisition of kokam and the acquisition of solaredge automation machines and 14 million related to the purchase of land and building formerly leased under a financial lease this was offset by 91 million attributed to cash received from the exercise of employee and nonemployee stockbase awards 

convertible senior note 

on september 25 2020 we issued 6325 million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes or notes in a transaction exempt from registration pursuant to rule 144a and regulation s under the securities act net proceeds from the offering after underwriters’ discount and commissions and offering expenses was 6179 million we intend to use the proceeds of the notes for general corporate purposes see note 11 to our annual financial statements for more information 

debt obligations 

during 2020 we redeemed all outstanding loans including the bank loan obligations acquired as part of the acquisition of kokam and entered into new bank loans in an aggregate amount of 152 million the new bank loans mature in two installments through june 30 2021 with monthly interest rate of 154 as of december 31 2020 the aggregate outstanding amount of the new bank loans was 168 million in addition during 2020 we entered into a second new bank loan in an aggregate amount of 14 million the second bank loan matures in september 2030 with a monthly interest rate of 25 as of december 31 2020 the aggregate outstanding amount of the second bank loan was 15 million 

inflation 

we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the last three years if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 

 

 

off‑balance sheet arrangements 

we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements in the year ended december 31 2018 the year ended december 31 2019 or the year ended december 31 2020 

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “gaap” the preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain see note 2 to our annual financial statements for more information 

revenue recognition 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted the accounting standards codification 606 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not substantially completed as of january 1 2018 as a result of this adoption we revised our accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed below 

we generate revenues from the sale of dc optimized inverter systems for solar pv installations which include our power optimizers inverters and cloud‑based monitoring platform as well as other solar related products ups systems lithiumion cells batteries energy storage solutions ev powertrain solutions and machinery our worldwide customer base includes large solar installers distributors epcs pv module manufacturers utility companies and other customers our products are fully functional at the time of shipment to the customer and do not require production modification or customization with the exception of some ups and ess systems that require installation and commissioning we recognize revenue under the core principle that transfer of control to the customers should be depicted in an amount reflecting the consideration we expect to receive in revenue in order to achieve that core principle we apply the following fivestep approach 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied provisions for rebates sales incentives and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded 

we generally sell our products to our customers pursuant to a customer’s standard purchase order and our customary terms and conditions we do not offer rights to return our products other than for normal warranty conditions and as such revenue is recorded upon shipment of products to customers and transfer of title and risk of loss under standard commercial terms we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine that appropriate credit limits are established prior to the acceptance and shipment of an order 

we provide our full web‑based monitoring platform for our solar products free of charge and revenues associated with the service since that date are being recognized ratably over 25 years in the absence of third party comparable pricing for such service management determines the revenue levels of this service based on the costs associated with providing the service plus appropriate margins that reflect management’s best estimate of the selling price these revenues are minimal and we do not expect this to become a significant source of revenue in the near future 

the most significant impact of the standard on our financial statements relates to advance payments received for performance obligations that extend for a period greater than one year applying the standard such performance obligations are those that include a financing component specifically i warranty extension services ii cloudbased monitoring and iii communication services 

we recognize financing component expenses in our consolidated statement of income in relation to advance payments for performance obligations that extend for a period greater than one year these financing component expenses are reflected in our deferred revenues balance the cumulative adjustments have decreased the retained earnings by 39 million while increasing the deferred revenues by the same amount 

product warranty 

we provide a standard limited product warranty for our solar products against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions our standard warranty period is 25 years for our power optimizers 12 years for our inverters and 10 years for our storage interface other products are sold with standard limited warranties that typically range in duration from one to ten years and in some cases for a longer period in certain cases customers can purchase an extended warranty for critical power products and our battery storage products that exceed the standard warranty period in addition customers can purchase extended warranties for inverters that increase the warranty period to up to 25 years 

our products are designed to meet the warranty periods and our reliability procedures cover component selection design accelerated life cycle tests and endofmanufacturing line testing however since our history in selling power optimizers and inverters is substantially shorter than the warranty period the calculation of warranty provisions is inherently uncertain 

we accrue for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based on anticipated warranty claims and actual historical warranty claims experience warranty provisions computed on a per‑unit sold basis are based on our best estimate of such costs and are included in our cost of revenues the warranty obligation is determined based on actual and predicted failure rates of the products cost of replacement and service and delivery costs incurred to correct a product failure our warranty obligation requires management to make assumptions regarding estimated failure rates and replacement costs 

in order to predict the failure rate of each of our products we have established a reliability model based on the estimated mean time between failures “mtbf” the mtbf represents the average elapsed time predicted for each product unit between failures during operation applying the mtbf failure rate over our install base for each product type and generation allows us to predict the number of failed units over the warranty period and estimates the costs associated with the product warranty predicted failure rates are updated periodically based on data returned from the field and new product versions as are replacement costs which are updated to reflect changes in our actual production costs for our products subcontractors’ labor costs and actual logistics costs 

since the mtbf model does not take into account additional non‑systematic failures such as failures caused by workmanship or manufacturing or design‑related issues and since warranty claims are at times opened for cases in which the error has been triggered by an improper installation we have developed a supplemental model to predict such cases and recognize the associated expenses ratably over the expected claim period this model which is based on actual root cause analysis of returned products identification of the causes of claims and time until each identified problem is revealed allows us to better predict actual warranty expenses and is updated periodically based on our experience taking into account the installed base of approximately 616 million power optimizers and approximately 26 million inverters as of december 31 2020 

if actual warranty costs differ significantly from these estimates adjustments may be required in the future which could adversely affect our gross profit and results of operations warranty obligations are classified as shortterm and longterm warranty obligations based on the period in which the warranty is expected to be claimed the warranty provision short and longterm was 1726 million and 2050 million in the year ended december 31 2019 and 2020 respectively 

inventory valuation 

our inventories comprise sellable finished goods raw materials bought for own manufacturing or on behalf of our contract manufacturers and faulty units returned under our warranty policy 

sellable finished goods and raw material inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based on the moving average cost method certain factors could affect the realizable value of our inventories including market and economic conditions technological changes existing product changes mainly due to cost reduction activities and new product introductions we consider historic usage expected demand anticipated sales price the effect of new product introductions product obsolescence product merchantability and other factors when evaluating the value of inventories inventory write‑downs are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and their estimated fair market value inventory write‑downs are recorded as cost of revenues in the accompanying statements of income and were 45 million and 89 million in the year ended december 31 2019 and 2020 respectively 

faulty products returned under our warranty policy are often refurbished and used as replacement units such products are written off upon receipt 

we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions that we use to record inventory at the lower of cost or market however if estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

business combination 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require our management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired technology and other intangible assets their useful lives and discount rates our management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

intangible and other longlived assets 

we evaluate the recoverability of finitelived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any impairment charges during the year ended december 31 2020 

acquired identifiable finitelived intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis or accelerated method over the estimated useful lives of the assets we believe the basis of amortization approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized over their estimated useful lives we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of finitelived intangible assets in case we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance is amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life 

goodwill 

goodwill reflects the excess of the consideration transferred including the fair value of any contingent consideration and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree over the assigned fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired goodwill is not amortized and is assigned to reporting units and tested for impairment at least on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 

the goodwill impairment test is performed according to the following principles 

1 an initial qualitative assessment may be performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 

2 if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying mount a quantitative fair value test is performed an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value is recognized 

we complete the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for the reporting unit on october 1 of each year and accordingly determines whether goodwill should be impaired as of december 31 2020 no impairment of goodwill has been identified 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 “income taxes” asc 740 which prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc 740 asc 74010 contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that on an evaluation of the technical merits the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 cumulative probability likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates customer concentrations and interest rates we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

approximately 412 487 and 522 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2018 the year ended december 31 2019 and the year ended december 31 2020 respectively were earned in non‑us dollar denominated currencies principally the euro our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located primarily the us dollar and new israeli shekel euro and to a lesser extent the korean won our new israeli shekel‑denominated expenses consist primarily of personnel and overhead costs our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 511 million for the year ended december 31 2020 a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the new israeli shekel and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 149 million for the year ended december 31 2020 a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2020 between the korean won and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 100 million for the year ended december 31 2020 

for purposes of our consolidated financial statements local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the us dollar on the balance sheet date and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rate as of the date of the transaction or at the average exchange rate to the us dollar during the reporting period 

to date we have used derivative financial instruments specifically foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign currency risks by hedging portions of the anticipated payroll payments denominated in new israeli shekels “nis” our foreign currency forward contracts are expected to mitigate exchange rate changes related to the hedged assets those hedging contracts are designated as cash flow hedges 

in addition we also entered into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge the company’s exposure to currencies other than the us dollar mainly put and call options to sell euro for us dollars put and call options to sell australian dollars “aud” for us dollars and forward contracts to sell aud for us dollars forward contracts to sell euro for us dollars and forward contracts to sell us dollars for south korean won “krw” these derivative instruments are not designated as cash flow hedges 

we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of 2238 million and 8271 at the end of the year ending december 31 2019 and the year ended december 31 2020 respectively which was held for working capital purposes we had availableforsale marketable securities with an estimated fair value of 2110 million and 2911 million on december 31 2019 and december 31 2020 respectively in addition we had bank deposits of 50 million and 601 million as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2020 respectively we had restricted bank deposits of 276 million and 26 million as of december 31 2019 december 31 2020 respectively 

additionally our hedging activities may also contribute to increased losses as a result of volatility in foreign currency markets if foreign exchange currency markets continue to be volatile such fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations in future periods also the volatility in the foreign currency markets may make it difficult to hedge our foreign currency exposures effectively 

concentrations of major customers 

our trade accounts receivables potentially expose us to a concentration of credit risk with our major customers for the year ended december 31 2020 one major customer accounted for 148 of our total revenues and as of december 31 2020 two major customers accounted for approximately 346 of our consolidated trade receivables balance for the year ended december 31 2019 one major customer accounted for 204 of total revenues and as of december 31 2019 one major customer accounted for approximately 321 of our consolidated trade receivables balance we currently do not foresee a credit risk associated with these receivables 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials including copper which are used in our products prices of these raw materials may be affected by supply restrictions or other market factors from time to time and we do not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate commodity risk significant price changes for these raw materials could reduce our operating margins if we are unable to recover such increases from our customers and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 9a controls and procedures 

disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of december 31 2020 in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and operating to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework management’s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment 

based on this assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors 

our independent registered public accounting firm kost forer gabbay  kasierer a member of ernst  young independently assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in the firm’s attestation report which is incorporated by reference into part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how welldesigned and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1 business 

introduction 

established in 2006 solaredge developed a dc optimized inverter solution that changed the way power is harvested and managed in photovoltaic known as pv systems our direct current or dc optimized inverter system maximizes power generation while lowering the cost of energy produced by the pv system for improved return on investment or roi additional benefits of the dc optimized inverter system include providing comprehensive and advanced safety features improved design flexibility and improved operating and maintenance or om with modulelevel and remote monitoring the typical solaredge optimized inverter system consists of our inverters power optimizers a communication device which enables access to a cloud based monitoring platform and in many cases additional smart energy management solutions our solutions address a broad range of solar market segments from residential solar installations to commercial and small utility‑scale solar installations since we began commercial shipments in 2010 we have shipped approximately 162 gigawatts “gw” of our dc optimized inverter systems and our products have been installed in solar pv systems in 133 countries 

since introducing the optimized inverter solution in 2010 solaredge has expanded its activity to other areas of smart energy technology both through organic growth and through acquisitions by leveraging worldclass engineering capabilities and with a relentless focus on innovation solaredge now offers energy solutions which include not only residential commercial and large scale pv systems but also product offerings in the areas of energy storage systems or ess and backup electric vehicle or ev components and charging capabilities home energy management grid services and virtual power plants lithiumion batteries and uninterrupted power supply known as ups solutions 

our technology and system architecture are protected by 179 awarded patents and 247 patent applications filed worldwide as of december 31 2019 we also have protection for some of our batteryrelated technology through kokam with 151 awarded patents and 5 pending applications in addition we have patents related to our emobility solutions through smre and its subsidiary iet spa with 18 awarded patents and 14 patent applications worldwide 

we primarily sell our products indirectly to thousands of solar installers through large distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers and directly to large solar installers and engineering procurement and construction firms “epcs” our customers include leading providers of solar pv systems to residential and commercial end users key solar distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers as well as several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules 

the pv industry is surveyed by ihs market an analytics company that ranked solaredge as the top pv inverter supplier worldwide by revenues and the top single phase pv inverter supplier worldwide based on megawatt shipments as of their published “ihs pv inverter market tracker q3 2019” as of december 31 2019 we have shipped in the aggregate approximately 499 million power optimizers and 21 million inverters more than 138 million pv installations many of which may include multiple inverters are currently connected to and monitored through our cloud based monitoring platform 

as part of our nonorganic growth we have completed three acquisitions during 2018 and 2019 each of which address our growth in the area of smart energy technology and power optimization 

in july 2018 we acquired the assets of a business for the development manufacturing and sale of upss for the aggregate amount of 121 million we purchased substantially all of the assets of gamatronic electronic ltd’s “gamatronic” including its intellectual property brand and tangible assets in october 2018 we also purchased the shares of gamatronic uk limited a uk wholly owned subsidiary of gamatronic responsible for the sale of these ups products in the uk for approximately 10 million net of cash acquired jointly the “gamatronic acquisition” 

in october 2018 we closed an acquisition the “kokam acquisition” of 745 of kokam co ltd “kokam” a provider of lithiumion cells batteries and energy storage solutions for approximately 825 million usd net of cash acquired since the kokam acquisition and to date we have increased our shareholdings in kokam to 100 at a cost of approximately 21 million headquartered in south korea kokam was founded in 1989 and has been manufacturing lithiumion cells and providing reliable safe highperformance solutions for the past twentynine years kokam provides battery solutions for a widevariety of industries including ess ups ev and the marine market 

in january 2019 we completed the acquisition the “smre acquisition” of a majority stake approximately 57 of smre spa “smre” for a total of approximately 73 million net of cash acquired out of which approximately 42 million was paid in cash and approximately 35 million was paid in shares of solaredge common stock since the smre acquisition and as of december 31 2019 we have increased our shareholdings in smre to approximately 999 at a cost of approximately 67 million founded in 1999 and headquartered in italy smre provides innovative integrated powertrain technology and electronics for light goods vehicles and light commercial vehicles as well as for emotorcycles  smre has more than fifteen years of experience developing endtoend emobility solutions for electric and hybrid vehicles used in motorcycles commercial vehicles and trucks these solutions include integrated highperforming powertrains with emotor motor drive gearbox battery bms chargers vehicle control unit sand software for electric vehicles 

limitations of traditional pv system technologies and the value proposition of our optimized inverter technology 

historically the solar pv industry used traditional string and central inverter architectures to harvest pv solar power however traditional inverter architectures result in energy losses as well as systemic challenges in design flexibility safety and monitoring over the years microinverter technology was introduced in an attempt to resolve these challenges but this technology has certain inherent limitations we believe that our dc optimized inverter system consisting of an inverter and distributed power optimizers best addresses all of these challenges 

our system allows for superior power harvesting and module management relative to traditional inverter systems by deploying power optimizers at each pv module while maintaining a competitive system cost by keeping the ac inversion and grid interaction centralized using a simplified dc‑ac inverter the entire system is monitored through our cloud‑based monitoring platform that enables reduced system om costs our system enables each pv module to operate at its own maximum power point known as mpp rather than a system‑wide average enabling dynamic response to real‑world conditions such as atmospheric conditions pv module aging soiling and shading and offering improved energy yield relative to traditional inverter systems in addition to higher efficiency our system’s installed cost per watt is competitive with traditional inverter systems of leading manufacturers and generally lower than comparable microinverter systems of leading manufacturers furthermore our architecture allows for complex rooftop system designs reliability and enhanced safety capabilities which meets applicable safety regulations known as rapid shutdown in the united states 

traditional inverter architecture  a solar pv system consists of pv modules which produce direct current “dc” power when exposed to sunlight an inverter which transforms the dc power into alternating current “ac” power that is required by the electricity grid and associated cabling fuse boxes and mounting hardware traditionally solar pv systems connected strings of solar pv modules to one or more inverters for this energy conversion 

traditional inverter architecture still constitutes the vast majority of the pv inverter market especially for larger commercial and utility installations however traditional inverter architecture suffers from significant inefficiencies leading to suboptimal power generation these challenges include 

•

module mismatch traditional inverter systems are unable to consistently produce maximum energy from pv modules each pv module in a system has a unique power production profile driven by differences in manufacturing and installation parameters the architecture of traditional inverter systems does not allow each pv module to operate at its unique mpp when pv modules are wired in series in a traditional inverter architecture the entire string’s output is reduced sometimes correlated directly to the output of the lowest‑performing pv module on the string output reduction can result from subtle variations in pv module composition atmospheric conditions soiling individual pv module locations and orientations or varying levels of pv module degradation over time 

•

partial shading many real‑world factors can cause a subset of the pv modules in a system to be partially shaded which can significantly affect the power output of the entire string for instance electric wires a chimney or even adjacent solar panels may cast a shadow during particular hours of the day or debris may accumulate this partial shading reduces the yield of a traditional solar pv system by decreasing or in extreme cases eliminating power output from the shaded modules overall losses to system production from such partial shading can range from small to substantial

dynamic maximum power point tracking loss the mpp of a pv module shifts constantly throughout the day as a result of atmospheric conditions a traditional inverter system’s inability to coordinate output on a module‑by‑module basis makes it difficult for the system to respond dynamically to the shifting mpp this inability to respond to the shifting mpp can reduce the potential power output of a traditional solar pv system by 3‑10 

in addition to power losses the traditional inverter architecture also has system design installation and operational challenges including 

•

rooftop system design complexities a traditional inverter system requires each string to be of the same length use the same type of pv modules and be positioned at the same angle toward the sun consequently rooftop asymmetries and obstructions result in either wasted roof space or inefficient duplication of system components 

•

safety hazards traditional inverter systems cannot shut down the dc output voltage at the pv module level the dc cables from these modules carry high voltages as long as the sun is shining even when the traditional inverter or the grid connection has been shut down this poses serious risks to installers fire fighters and anyone else who performs work on or around the installation such safety hazards have recently prompted heightened safety installation and operation procedures and regulations in a growing number of geographies compliance with which increases the cost of traditional pv systems 

•

no module level monitoring a traditional inverter system cannot track power output temperature or any other attribute of a single pv module consequently a system operator cannot perform remote diagnostics track performance of pv system components or receive alerts about individual pv module status and may be unaware of specific module‑level problems or breakdowns 

the first generation of module level power electronics “mlpe” was the microinverter this technology scaled down the traditional inverter to a size and power appropriate to a single pv module by creating control and monitoring at the module level microinverters solved certain challenges of the traditional inverter system architecture however microinverter architecture has its own limitations such as 

•

higher initial cost per watt and limited economies of scale microinverters perform all the functionality of the traditional inverter but at each pv module and consequently a microinverter system has a higher initial upfront cost of components relative to traditional inverter architecture in addition as every pv module must have its own microinverter the cost per watt of a microinverter system does not decrease with scale as such microinverters are generally more expensive than traditional inverter systems on a cost per watt basis for residential installations and not economically viable relative to traditional inverter systems for large commercial and utility installations 

•

energy storage pv solar energy systems are increasingly being paired with batteries either to offer backup functionalities due to grid instability or to provide increased selfconsumption with the evolution of subsidies this is leading to the inverter becoming an important factor in managing and controlling energy storage batteries store energy only in its dc form but due to their architecture standard string inverters and microinverters require multiple inversions from dc to ac and then back to dc power before storing energy into the battery this not only results in energy loss during the conversion process but also means the inverter acts as a bottleneck and limiting factor for energy storage 

•

grid code compliance with the growing penetration of solar energy many utilities in individual us states and europe have adopted new sets of grid codes to preserve the stability of the electric grid these grid codes require solar pv inverters to respond dynamically to variances in grid‑wide voltage which typically requires inverter hardware and software to be reengineered in most cases adaptation to these new grid codes would require added costs and complexities limiting the ability of microinverters to address some markets 

the solaredge solution our dc optimized inverter system maximizes power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system and providing comprehensive and advanced safety features our solution consists of inverters power optimizers a communication device which enables access to our cloud based monitoring platform and addresses a broad range of solar market segments from residential solar installations to commercial and small utility‑scale solar installations additional smart energy features and hardware that can be added to our solution includes a battery pack for storage of energy and a home energy automation system which enables greater savings for the system owner 

the key advantages of our solution include 

•

maximized pv module power output our power optimizers provide module‑level mpp tracking and real‑time adjustments of current and voltage to the optimal working point of each individual pv module this enables each pv module to continuously produce its maximum power potential independent of other modules in the same string thus minimizing module mismatch and partial shading losses by performing these adjustments at a very high rate our power optimizers also solve the dynamic mpp losses associated with traditional inverters 

•

optimized architecture with economies of scale our system shifts certain functions of the traditional inverter to our power optimizers while keeping the dc to ac function and grid interaction in our inverter as a result our inverter is smaller more efficient more reliable and less expensive than inverters used in traditional inverter systems the cost savings that we have achieved on the inverter enable our system to be priced at a cost per watt that is comparable with traditional inverter systems of leading manufacturers as a pv system grows in size our inverter benefits from economies of scale making our technology viable for large commercial and utility‑scale applications 

•

enhanced system design flexibility unlike a traditional inverter system that requires each string to be the same length use the same type of pv modules and be positioned at the same angle toward the sun our system allows significant design flexibility by enabling the installer to place pv modules in uneven string lengths and on multiple roof facets this design flexibility 

•

increases the amount of the available roof that can be utilized for power production unlike traditional inverter systems our system does not require each string to be the same length use the same type of pv modules or be positioned at the same angle toward the sun as a result our system is significantly less prone to wasted roof space resulting from rooftop asymmetries and obstructions 

•

reduces the number of field change orders for example some installers use remote tools to estimate the size and configuration of an installation in connection with the customer acquisition process this is especially common for high‑volume residential arrays where an exhaustive survey of rooftop obstructions would be uneconomical in some cases installers discover that their preliminary design based on remote tools cannot be implemented due to unexpected shading or other obstructions with traditional inverter system designs an obstructed module may require a significant system redesign and a modification of the customer contract to take into account the changed system design our dc optimized inverter solution enables an installer to compensate or adjust for most obstructions without materially changing the original design or requiring a modification to the customer contract 

•

reduced balance of system costs our dc optimized inverter system allows significantly longer strings to be connected to the same inverter as compared to a traditional inverter system this minimizes the cost of cabling fuse boxes and other ancillary electric components these factors together result in easier installation with shorter design times and a lower initial cost per watt while enabling larger installations per rooftop 

•

continuous monitoring and control to reduce operation and maintenance costs our cloud‑based monitoring platform provides full data visibility at the module level string level inverter level and system level the data can be accessed remotely by any web‑enabled device allowing comprehensive analysis immediate fault detection and alerts these monitoring features reduce om costs for the system owner by identifying and locating faults enabling remote testing and reducing field visits 

•

enhanced safety we have incorporated module‑level safety mechanisms in our system to protect installers electricians and firefighters each power optimizer is configured to reduce output to 1 volt unless the power optimizer receives a fail‑safe signal from a functioning inverter as a result if the inverter is shut down eg for system maintenance due to malfunction in the event of a fire or otherwise the dc voltage throughout the system is reduced to a safe level our dc optimized inverters comply with the applicable safety requirements of the areas in which they are sold providing incremental cost savings to installers by eliminating the need for additional hardware such as dc breakers switches or fire‑proof ducts required by traditional inverter systems in the us the solaredge safedc feature is compliant with nec 2014  nec 2017 rapid shutdown functionality section 69012 solaredge inverters also have a builtin protection designed to mitigate the effects of some arcing faults that may pose a risk of fire in compliance with the ul1699b arc detection standard 

•

high reliability solar pv systems are typically expected to operate for at least 25 years under harsh outdoor conditions high reliability is critical and is facilitated by systems and components that have low heat generation solid and stable materials and an absence of moving parts we have designed our system to meet these stringent requirements our power optimizers dissipate much less heat than microinverters because no dc‑ac inversion occurs at the module level as a result less heat is dissipated beneath the pv module which improves lifetime expectancy and reliability of our power optimizers our power optimizers’ high switching frequency allows the use of ceramic capacitors with a low fixed rate of aging and a proven life expectancy in excess of 25 years further we use automotive‑grade application specific integrated circuits “asics” that embed many of the required electronics into the asic this reduces the number of components and consequently the potential points of failure 

•

energy storage our dc optimized inverter system allows solar energy to be directly stored in batteries without any conversion thereby eliminating energy losses that are associated with such conversions and improving the roi of pv associated battery systems 

•

energy management strategically located at the intersection between pv home usage and the grid inverters are well positioned to act as smart energy managers our smart inverters incorporate the management of pv energy battery storage smart devices and grid interaction by enabling smart energy management in our inverter system owners can not only store solar energy but also control the timing of their pv energy consumption in order to increase their energy independence take advantage of lower timeofuse rates reduce electric bills and improve overall system roi 

•

distributed energy generation as the electric grid transitions from one based on centralized power stations to a network of distributed renewable energy sources our inverter acts as a local control system that can manage the energy resources underlying such distributed network our inverters are a key part of developing a distributed and interactive grid that can help support grid stability one such example is inverterenabled charging and discharging of batteries as part of a virtual power plant to help manage the load on the grid and grid stability

solaredge software we offer a variety of professional software tools from system design to monitoring 

our “designer app” is a free webbased tool that helps solar professionals to plan build and validate our residential and commercial systems from inception to installation 

our “mapper app” provides solaredge installers with an efficient streamlined process for registering the physical layout of new pv sites in the solaredge monitoring platform installers use the mapper app to scan solaredge power optimizer and inverter barcodes creating a virtual map of the pv site in the monitoring platform to help facilitate remote diagnostics 

making installations quick and simple our “setapp” is used to activate and configure solaredge inverters during commissioning directly through a smartphone 

our cloud‑based monitoring platform collects power voltage current and system data sent from our inverters and power optimizers and allows users to view the data at the module level string level inverter level and system level from any browser or from most smart phones and tablets the monitoring software continuously analyzes data and flags potential problems the monitoring software includes features which are used on a routine basis by integrators installers maintenance staff and system owners to improve a solar pv system’s performance by maximizing solar power harvesting and reducing om costs by increasing system up‑time and detecting pv module performance issues more effectively connection to the monitoring server is completed during installation by the installer the installer then receives full access to system data through the monitoring software and can select the amount of data to be shared with the system owner

smart energy management there are currently two separate energy technology industries that exist today solar energy production and automation technology inverters are taking on an expanded role in energy management and automation and in order to address these market needs we are developing and providing automation products this line of products when used with the solaredge solution is designed to allow system owners to increase selfconsumption by shifting energy usage to match peak solar pv production as well as offer a convenient wireless control option over various building andor home devices an example of this solution would be using excess solar pv energy to heat water or the ability to remotely turn on or off certain power sources such as lighting or electrical appliances the introduction of these products is dependent upon certification and region specific needs and as such these products are not yet available in all of the geographies in which solaredge operates 

grid services as pv and storage continue to proliferate around the world energy production is transitioning from a centralized system to a distributed network model where energy is produced close to the location in which it is consumed and stored this model creates an opportunity for new interconnected and decentralized energy networks offering improved grid reliability and stability new energy services and reduction of grid infrastructure costs solaredge grid services deliver near realtime aggregative control and data reporting enabling the pooling of distributed energy resources — photovoltaic systems battery storage electric vehicle chargers and loads — in the cloud for the creation of virtual power plants the solaredge grid services and vpp solution provides sophisticated management platforms to enable realtime aggregated control of available energy resources to meet everchanging supply needs and demand in 2019 solaredge generated revenues from selling grid services in the us europe and australia including services provided to independent system operators energy retailers national installers and others 

product roadmap 

our products reflect the innovation focus and capabilities of our technology departments our core product roadmap is divided into five categories power optimizers inverters software energy storage and smart energy management 

power optimizers we currently sell our third generation power optimizer which was designed for fully automated assembly and which is based on our third generation asic a key element of our reliability strategy and a significant differentiator relative to our competitors is our use of proprietary asics to control among other things our power optimizer’s power conversion safety features and pv module monitoring instead of using large numbers of discrete components our power optimizer uses a single proprietary asic thus reducing the total number of components in an electrical circuit and thereby improving reliability in june 2017 we unveiled our fourth generation power optimizer which uses fourth generation asic and incorporates a new safety mechanism for pv systems in addition we are also continuing to develop the necessary subsystems for the fifth generation asic which will be used in our fifth generation power optimizer each new asic generation reduces the number of components required and meaningfully improved the efficiency of the power optimizer the efficiency improvement reduces the energy losses which in turn reduces the amount of heat dissipation this enables design of a more costeffective and usually smaller enclosure and also keeps the electronics cooler thereby improving the power optimizer’s reliability 

inverters our inverter roadmap is intended to serve three purposes i expand addressable market by developing new and larger inverters designed specifically for larger commercial installations and utility‑scale projects ii improve the electronics to increase the total power throughput without changing the existing enclosure thereby reducing the actual cost per watt and increasing economies of scale and iii improve ease of installation by integrating additional functionality required in certain installations in order to reduce costs of additional hardware and subcontractors’ labor costs

our technology 

we have drawn on our expertise in the fields of power electronics magnetic design mechanical and heat dissipation capabilities control loops and algorithms and power line communications to design and develop what we believe to be the most advanced commercial solutions for harvesting power from solar pv systems our advanced technologies are explained in more detail below 

as part of our growth strategy we have acquired companies that have technologies that can leverage our expertise in power electronics and power optimization by combining acquired resources with our current research and development teams we are expanding our activity into other essential areas such as emobility battery storage and energy storage systems 

power optimizers 

our power optimizers are dcdc step upstep down buck‑boost converters designed and developed to operate in harsh outdoor environments at very high conversion efficiency our power optimizers include proprietary power electronics customized to efficiently convert power from the pv module to the inverter the components are selected and the conversion topology is designed for the power optimizer specifications and the power optimizer design is verified for consistent performance and reliability in numerous lab tests and simulations 

a key factor in the performance of our power optimizer is determined by the digital control algorithms and closed‑loop control mechanism the power optimizer’s control is built into our advanced asic which is responsible for all critical digital control functions of the power optimizer including detailed power analysis digital control of the power conversion subsystem power line communications and networking since each power optimizer handles the power and voltage of a single module we are able to reach a high degree of semiconductor integration by leveraging low cost silicon in standard semiconductor packages as a result much of the functionality of our power optimizer can be integrated into a standard asic instead of use of discrete electronic components resulting in lower costs and higher reliability 

the asic performs the critical power analysis and power conversion control functions of the power optimizer the power analysis functions process the state and working parameters at the power optimizer’s input and output and together with advanced digital control and state machine logic control the power conversion function in addition our digital control system uses technology that allows the solar pv installation to anticipate and adapt to changing operating conditions and to protect itself against system anomalies 

each power optimizer in the array is connected to the inverter by a power line communications networking link our power line communications link uses a proprietary networking technology that we developed utilizing the existing dc wiring between the power optimizers and the inverter to transmit and receive data between these devices 

inverters 

our inverter is designed for single‑stage dcac conversion using our inverter in combination with the power optimizers allows the inverter control loop to maintain a regulated dc voltage level at its input thereby allowing for long uneven and multi‑faceted strings while also enabling custom cost–efficient and reliable inverter design and component selection all of the power components as well as the main magnetic components for our inverters can then be optimized for dcac inversion at high efficiency 

our inverters’ digital control algorithms are implemented using programmable digital signal processors which allow for flexibility and adaptation of control loops for various grids and for the requirements and standards of different grid operators across geographies we have already implemented the control mechanisms necessary to support advanced grid codes and standards that are required to support high penetration of solar energy into utility grids 

manufacturing 

we have designed our manufacturing processes to produce high quality products at competitive costs the strategy is threefold outsource automate and localize we currently contract to have our solar products manufactured by two of the world’s leading global electronics manufacturing service providers jabil circuit inc “jabil” and flex ltd “flex” by using contract manufacturers rather than building our own manufacturing infrastructure we are able to access advanced manufacturing equipment processes skills and capacity on a “capital light” budget our contract manufacturers are responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products except with regard to endofline testing equipment and other specific manufacturing equipment utilized in assembling our products or subcomponents which are financed and owned by the company we expect to continue this funding arrangement in the future with respect to any expansions to such existing lines further contracting with global providers such as jabil and flex gives us added flexibility to manufacture certain products in china and vietnam closer to target markets in asia and the north american west coast as well as other products in hungary closer to target markets in europe and the north american east coast potentially increasing responsiveness to customers while reducing costs and delivery times during the year ended december 31 2019 we opened a new manufacturing site in vietnam which is expected to reach full production capacity in the second quarter of 2020 in july 2017 we executed a long term lease agreement for 10000 square meters in israel intended for the establishment of a manufacturing facility for the production of product prototypes manufacturing and the development of proprietary manufacturing and testing equipment the facility is anticipated to reach full production capacity in the third quarter of 2020 

we have developed propriety automated assembly lines for the manufacturing of our power optimizers these assembly lines currently operating in all of our manufacturing facilities enable the manufacturing of more than 4000 optimizers per machine per day we invest resources in additional automated assembly lines as well as in automated machinery for subassembly and selfmanufacturing of certain components used in our products and we own and are responsible for funding all of the capital expenses related thereto the current and expected capital expenses associated with these automated assembly lines and other machinery is funded out of our cash flows 

we source our raw materials through various component manufacturers and invest resources in continued costreduction efforts as well as verifying second and third sources so as to limit dependence on sole suppliers 

our korean subsidiary kokam has a manufacturing facility for lithiumion cells and batteries that has the capacity to manufacture up to 150 mwh per annum 

reliability and quality control 

our power optimizers are either connected to each pv module by installers or embedded in each pv module by pv module manufacturers our power optimizers are designed to be as reliable as the pv module itself and capable of withstanding the same operating and environmental conditions 

our reliability methodology includes a multi‑level plan with design analysis sub‑system testing of critical components by accelerated life testing and integrative testing of design prototypes by highly accelerated life testing and large sample groups as part of our reliability efforts we subject components to industry standard conditions and tests including in accelerated life chambers that simulate burn‑in thermal cycling damp‑heat and other stresses we also conduct out of box audits oba on our finished products online reliability tests ort are conducted on our optimizers and we test complete products in stress tests and in the field our rigorous testing processes have helped us to develop highly reliable products 

in order to verify the quality of each of our products when it leaves the manufacturing plant each component sub‑assembly and final product are tested multiple times during production these tests include automatic optical inspection in‑circuit testing board‑ functional testing safety testing and integrative stress testing we employ a serial number‑driven manufacturing process auditing and traceability system that allows us to control production line activities verify correct manufacturing processes and to achieve item‑specific traceability 

as a part of our quality and reliability approach failed products from the field are returned and subjected to root cause analysis the results of which are used to improve our product and manufacturing processes and design and further reduce our field failure rate

our dc optimized inverter system competes principally with products from traditional inverter manufacturers such as sma solar technology ag abb ltd and huawei technologies co ltd as well as from other chinese inverter manufacturers in the north american residential market we compete with traditional inverter manufacturers as well as microinverter manufacturers such as enphase energy inc in addition several new entrants to the mlpe market including low‑cost asian manufacturers have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped similar products we believe that our dc optimized inverter system offers significant technology and cost advantages that reflect a competitive differentiation over traditional inverter systems and microinverter technologies 

the markets for our lithiumion products are competitive as well and we compete with global cell and battery manufacturers in the ess market our energy storage solutions compete with products from global manufactures such as lg chem samsung sdi byd and panasonic 

in the ups market our ups products compete with products and solutions from global ups providers such as schneider electric eaton and vertiv 

the vehicle emobility market is dominated primarily by significant manufacturers such as robert bosch gmbh zf friedrichshafen ag dana incorporated and magna international as the global emobility market expands major automotive manufacturers such as toyota honda tesla general motors and ford have increased their investments in the electric and hybrid vehicle components in order to increase their market share 

government incentives 

us federal state and local government bodies as well as nonus government bodies provide incentives to owners end users distributors and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates tax credits lower vat rate and other financial incentives such as system performance payments payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar pv systems from property tax assessments the market for on‑grid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of these government subsidies and economic incentives which vary by geographic market and from time to time in general the amount and availability of these incentives and subsidies to encourage the development of solar pv energy have been declining and are expected to continue to decline 

import tariffs 

escalating trade tensions between the united states and china have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions including tariffs applicable to some of our products in january 2018 a tariff on imported solar modules and cells was adopted in the united states the tariff which does not apply directly to our products except possibly with respect to power optimizers that are embedded onto solar panels in china was initially set at 30 with a gradual reduction over four years to 15 in addition in july 2018 a 10 tariff on a long list of products imported from china including inverters and power optimizers was adopted in the united states under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 and became effective on september 24 2018 in june 2019 the us trade representative “ustr” increased the rate of such tariffs from 10 to 25 on january 15 2020 the united states and china entered into an initial trade deal which preserves the 2018 tariffs and indicates additional sanctions may be imposed if china breaches the terms of the deal 

in order to mitigate the negative effect of increased tariffs in the third quarter of 2019 we raised the price of our products sold in the us despite the price increases the tariffs had a net negative effect on our gross margins in response to the increased tariffs we increased our manufacturing capabilities at our vietnam manufacturing facility during the fourth quarter of 2019 and we expect to continue to increase the capacity during 2020 

seasonality 

the solar energy market is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations affected by weather for example during the winter months in europe and the northeastern us where the climate is particularly cold and snowy it is typical to see a decline in pv installations and this decline can impact the timing of orders for our products 

employees 

as of december 31 2019 we had 2431 full‑time employees of these full‑time employees 755 were engaged in research and development 416 in sales and marketing 1031 in operations production and support and 229 in general and administrative capacities of our employees 1161 were based in israel 295 were based in korea 235 were based in the us 185 were based in china 197 were based in italy and an additional 358 were based elsewhere

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in particular forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties some of which cannot be predicted or quantified see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

risks related to our business and our industry 

we cannot be certain that we will sustain our current level of profitability in the future 

we achieved a net profit of 842 million 1280 million and 1450 million in the years ended december 31 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively this high growth rate in profitability may not be sustainable over time while we continue to grow our market share our revenue growth is not expected to grow at the same pace that it has in past years in addition our revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons many of which are outside our control including a decline in demand for our products increased competition a decrease in the growth of the solar industry or our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities if we fail to maintain sufficient revenue to support our operations we may not be able to sustain profitability

in addition we expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business including in connection with recent or future acquisitions as well as ongoing marketing and developing our products development of our own manufacturing facilities expanding into new product markets and geographies maintaining and enhancing our research and development operations and hiring additional personnel we do not know whether our revenues will grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs or the extent of these expenses or their impact on our results of operations

the rapidly evolving and competitive nature of the solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects our entry into other adjacent markets through recent acquisitions is new and highly competitive and it is difficult to evaluate our future in these new markets as well 

much of our growth has occurred in recent periods the rapidly evolving and competitive nature of the solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects in addition we have limited insight into emerging trends that may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects our recent acquisitions in adjacent markets such as upss ess and emobility are new to us and these are highly competitive markets in which we will need to compete we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries including unpredictable and volatile revenues and increased expenses as we continue to grow our business

the viability and demand for solar energy solutions ups solutions ess and emobility products and in turn our products may be affected by many factors outside of our control including

•

cost competitiveness reliability and performance of solar pv systems compared to conventional and nonsolar renewable energy sources and products 

•

availability and amount of government subsidies and incentives to support the development and deployment of solar energy solutions 

•

the extent to which the electric power industry and broader energy industries are deregulated to permit broader adoption of solar electricity generation 

•

prices of traditional carbonbased energy sources 

•

levels of investment by endusers of solar energy products which tend to decrease when economic growth slows and 

•

the emergence continuance or success of or increased government support for other alternative energy generation technologies and products 

if we do not manage these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully our business and results of operations will suffer

if demand for solar energy solutions does not continue to grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our business and results of operations will suffer 

our solution is utilized in solar pv installations as a result our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years and we cannot be certain that consumers and businesses with respect to distributed solar solutions or utilities with respect to utilityscale solar projects will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to grow our business if demand for solar energy solutions fails to develop sufficiently demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business 

federal state local and foreign government bodies provide incentives to owners end users distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments payments of renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar pv systems from property tax assessments the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market because our customers’ sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business for example in 2015 the us congress passed a multiyear extension to the solar investment tax credit itc such extension helped exponentially grow the us solar market as of january 1 2020 the itc is being gradually reduced from 30 percent to 26 percent for both residential and commercial in 2020 and is expected to reach 10 percent for commercial only in 2023 the reduction in the itc could reduce the demand for solar energy solutions in the us which would have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

in general subsidies and incentives may expire on a particular date end when the allocated funding is exhausted or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase or as a result of legal challenges the adoption of new statutes or regulations or the passage of time these reductions or terminations often occur without warning 

in addition several jurisdictions have adopted renewable portfolio standards which mandate that a certain portion of electricity delivered by utilities to customers come from a set of eligible renewable energy resources by a certain compliance date some programs further specify that a portion of the renewable energy quota must be from solar electricity under some programs a utility can receive a “credit” for renewable energy produced by a third party by either purchasing the electricity directly from the producer or paying a fee to obtain the right to renewable energy generated but used by the generator or sold to another party a renewable energy credit allows the utility to add this electricity to its renewable portfolio requirement total without actually expending the capital for generating facilities however there can be no assurances that such policies will continue for example in december 2015 nevadas public utilities commission increased the fixed service charge for netmetered solar customers and lowered compensation for net excess solar generation proposals to extend compliance deadlines reduce targets or repeal standards have also been introduced in a number of states reduction or elimination of renewable portfolio standards or successful efforts to meet current standards could harm or halt the growth of the solar pv industry and our business

changes in the us trade environment including the recent imposition of import tariffs could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenues results of operations or cash flows 

escalating trade tensions between the united states and china have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions including tariffs applicable to certain of our products in january 2018 a tariff on imported solar modules and cells was adopted in the united states the tariff which does not apply directly to our products except possibly with respect to power optimizers that are embedded onto solar panels in china was initially set at 30 with a gradual reduction over four years to 15 in addition in july 2018 a 10 tariff on a long list of products imported from china including inverters and power optimizers was adopted in the united states under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 and became effective on september 24 2018 in june 2019 the ustr increased the rate of such tariffs from 10 to 25

on january 15 2020 the united states and china entered into an initial trade deal which preserves the bulk of the tariffs placed in 2018 and maintains a threat of additional sanctions should china breach the terms of the deal

in order to mitigate the negative effect of increased tariffs we raised the price of our products sold in the united states in the third quarter of 2019 despite the price increases the tariffs had a negative effect on our gross margins in response to the increased tariffs we focused efforts and resources on opening an additional manufacturing facility in vietnam the tariffs and the possibility of additional tariffs in the future have created uncertainty in the industry if the price of solar systems in the united states increases the use of solar systems could become less economically feasible and could reduce our gross margins or reduce the demand of solar systems manufactured and sold which in turn may decrease demand for our products additionally existing or future tariffs may negatively affect key customers suppliers and manufacturing partners such outcomes could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenues results of operations or cash flows and continuing uncertainty could cause sales volatility price fluctuations or supply shortages or cause our customers to advance or delay their purchase of our products it is difficult to predict what further traderelated actions governments may take which may include additional or increased tariffs and trade restrictions and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to such actions

changes to net metering policies may significantly reduce demand for electricity from solar pv systems and harm our business 

our business benefits from favorable net metering policies in most us states and some european countries in which our customers operate net metering allows a solar pv system owner to pay his or her local electric utility only for power usage net of production from the solar pv system transforming the conventional relationship between customers and traditional utilities system owners receive credit for the energy that the solar installation generates to offset energy usage at times when the solar installation is not generating energy under a net metering program the customer typically pays for the net energy used or receives a credit against future bills at the retail rate if more energy is produced than consumed in some locations customers are also reimbursed by the electric utility for net excess generation on a periodic basis

most us states have adopted some form of net metering however net metering programs have recently come under regulatory scrutiny in some us states due to challenges alleging that net metering policies inequitably shift costs onto nonsolar ratepayers by allowing solar ratepayers to sell electricity at rates that are too high for utilities to recoup their fixed costs we cannot assure you that the programs will not be significantly modified going forward

if the value of the credit that customers receive for net metering is significantly reduced endusers may be unable to recognize the same level of cost savings associated with net metering that current endusers enjoy the absence of favorable net metering policies or of net metering entirely or the imposition of new charges that only or disproportionately affect endusers that use net metering would significantly limit demand for solar pv systems that are sold by our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future growth

existing electric utility industry regulations and changes to regulations may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar pv systems that may significantly reduce demand for our products or harm our ability to compete 

federal state local and foreign government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry and internal policies and regulations promulgated by electric utilities heavily influence the market for electricity generation products and services these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and the interconnection of customerowned electricity generation and governments and utilities continuously modify these regulations and policies these regulations and policies could deter purchases of renewable energy products including solar pv systems sold by our customers this could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for our products for example utilities commonly charge fees to larger industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for backup purposes these fees could increase the cost to use solar pv systems sold by our customers and make them less desirable thereby harming our business prospects financial condition and results of operations in addition depending on the region electricity generated by solar pv systems competes most effectively with expensive peakhour electricity from the electric grid rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the utilities’ peak hour pricing policies or rate design such as to a flat rate could require the price of solar pv systems and their component parts to be lower in order to compete with the price of electricity from the electric grid

changes in current laws or regulations applicable to us or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the us europe or other jurisdictions in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations any changes to government or internal utility regulations and policies that favor electric utilities could reduce the competitiveness of solar pv systems sold by our customers and cause a significant reduction in demand for our products and services for example regulators in certain us states have been asked to consider proposals to assess fees on consumers purchasing energy from solar pv systems or imposing a new charge that would disproportionately impact solar pv system owners who utilize net metering either of which would increase the cost of solar pv energy to those consumers and could reduce demand for our products any similar government or utility policies adopted in the future that discourage the growth of solar pv systems could reduce demand for our products and services and adversely impact our growth in addition changes in our products or changes in export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid or other renewable energy resources would make the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and would likely lower sales of our products the price of electricity derived from the utility grid could decrease as a result of

•

construction of a significant number of new power generation plants including plants utilizing natural gas nuclear coal renewable energy or other generation technologies 

•

relief of transmission constraints that enable local centers to generate energy less expensively 

•

reductions in the price of natural gas 

•

utility rate adjustment and customer class cost reallocation 

•

energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce electricity consumption 

•

development of smartgrid technologies that lower the peak energy requirements of a utility generation facility 

•

development of new or lowercost energy storage technologies that have the ability to reduce a customer’s average cost of electricity by shifting load to offpeak times and 

•

development of new energy generation technologies that provide less expensive energy 

moreover technological developments in the solar components industry could allow our competitors and their customers to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be achieved by us and our customers which could result in reduced demand for our products

if the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations incorporating our systems is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed

an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a solar pv system and could reduce the demand for smart energy products and thus demand for our products 

many endusers depend on financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build or purchase a solar pv system as a result an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or their customers the endusers to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a solar pv system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our products which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of endusers install solar pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through financing an increase in interest rates could lower such enduser’s return on investment on a solar pv system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar pv systems and in each case could cause such endusers to seek alternative investments

the market for our products is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce power optimizers inverters solar pv system monitoring and other smart energy products which could negatively affect our results of operations and market share 

the market for solar pv solutions is highly competitive we principally compete with traditional inverter manufacturers as well as microinverter manufacturers currently our dc optimized inverter system competes with products from traditional inverter manufacturers and microinverter manufacturers as well as emerging technology companies offering alternative mlpe products over the past few years several new entrants to the inverter and mlpe market including lowcost asian manufacturers have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped products in markets in which we sell our products including most recently with respect to sales in australia and in europe we expect competition to intensify as new and existing competitors enter the market in addition there are several new entrants that are proposing solution to the rapid shutdown functionality which has become a regulatory requirement for pv rooftop solar systems in the united states if these new technologies are successful in offering a price competitive and technological attractive solution to the residential solar pv market this could make it more difficult for us to maintain market share

several of our existing and potential competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices for our products in order to compete effectively if we have to reduce our prices by more than we anticipated or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer

in addition competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than us may partner with other competitors to provide combined technologies and competing solutions and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may have a material adverse effect on demand for our offerings 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advances in other forms of distributed solar pv power generation storage solutions such as batteries the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could result in product obsolescence the loss of competitiveness of our products decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors

the solar industry has historically been cyclical and experienced periodic downturns 

our future success partly depends on continued demand for solar pv systems in the endmarkets we serve including the residential and commercial sectors in the united states and europe the solar industry has historically been cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns which may affect the demand for equipment that we manufacture the solar industry has undergone challenging business conditions in past years including downward pricing pressure for pv modules mainly as a result of overproduction and reductions in applicable governmental subsidies contributing to demand decreases although the solar industry has recovered from this downturn there is no assurance that the solar industry will not suffer significant downturns in the future which will adversely affect demand for our solar products and our results of operations

defects or performance problems in our products could result in loss of customers reputational damage and decreased revenue and we may face warranty indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products 

although our products meet our stringent quality requirements they may contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new generations are released errors defects or poor performance can arise due to design flaws defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties which can affect both the quality and the yield of the product in the first three quarters of 2019 we indeed experienced an increased number of singlephase inverter failures and heightened call center activity which we attributed to releasing new products and capabilities which is typically characterized by an initial period of stabilization until manufacturing processes are fully mature any actual or perceived errors defects or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products shipment delays rejection of our products damage to our reputation lost revenue diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and increases in customer service and support costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

furthermore defective components may give rise to warranty indemnity or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive from the affected products we offer a minimum 12year limited warranty for our inverters extendable to twenty five years for an additional cost and a 25year limited warranty for our power optimizers our limited warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship of our products under normal use and service conditions as a result we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold products and recognized revenue while we do have accrued reserves for warranty claims our estimated warranty costs for previously sold products may change to the extent future products are not compatible with earlier generation products under warranty our warranty accruals are based on our assumptions and we do not have a long history of making such assumptions as a result these assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our systems causing us to incur substantial unanticipated expense to repair or replace defective products in the future or to compensate customers for defective products our failure to accurately predict future claims could result in unexpected volatility in and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

if one of our products were to cause injury to someone or cause property damage including as a result of product malfunctions defects or improper installation then we could be exposed to product liability claims we could incur significant costs and liabilities if we are sued and if damages are awarded against us further any product liability claim we face could be expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention the successful assertion of a product liability claim against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages penalties or fines subject us to adverse publicity damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely affect sales of our products in addition product liability claims injuries defects or other problems experienced by other companies in the residential solar industry could lead to unfavorable market conditions for the industry as a whole and may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract new customers thus harming our growth and financial performance

if we do not forecast demand for our products accurately we may experience product shortages delays in product shipment excess product inventory or difficulties in planning expenses which will adversely affect our business and financial condition 

our products are manufactured according to our estimates of customer demand which requires us to make multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to demand from solar pv installers and distributors their end customers and general market conditions because we sell a large portion of our products to larger solar installers and various distributors who in turn sell to local installers who in turn sell to their end customers the system owner we have limited visibility as to end customer demand and it is difficult to forecast future enduser demand to plan our operations if we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are cancelled or shipments are delayed we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell conversely if we underestimate demand we may not have sufficient inventory to meet end customer demand or to ramp up production at our contract manufacturers in a timely manner or we could incur additional costs lose market share damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forego potential revenue opportunities for example in late 2017 and during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2019 we had high customer demand and certain component shortages which forced us to shorten transportation time from our factories in china by using air freight rather than less expensive ocean freight

we face risks related to actual or threatened health epidemics and other outbreaks which could significantly disrupt our manufacturing and operations 

our business could be adversely impacted by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in wuhan china any widespread outbreak of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments could cause disruption to our suppliers and contract manufacturers located in china and elsewhere and have a material and adverse effect on our business operations our suppliers and manufacturers could be disrupted by worker absenteeism quarantines office and factory closures disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure or other travel or healthrelated restrictions if our suppliers or manufacturers are so affected our supply chain manufacturing and product shipments will be delayed which could adversely affect our business operations and customer relationships in addition the macroeconomic effects of the coronavirus outbreak in china and other markets could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and likely impact our operating results our business is also highly dependent on travel of our sales operations quality and reliability and other managers and employees limitations placed on travel both to china and other regions in asia or elsewhere could significantly limit our ability to continue to market our products establish relationships with new customers lead training of installers and oversee and maintain quality control of our manufacturing lines although the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on our business and operations remains uncertain the continued spread of the coronavirus or the occurrence of other epidemics and the imposition of related public health measures and travel restrictions may adversely impact our business financial condition operating results and cash flows

we are dependent on ocean transportation to deliver our products in a cost efficient manner if we are unable to use ocean transportation to deliver our products our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 

we rely on commercial ocean transportation for the delivery of a large percentage of our products to our customers we also rely on more expensive air transportation when ocean transportation is not available or compatible with the delivery time requirements of our customers or when we are unable to meet the growing volume demands of our customers and need to accelerate delivery times our ability to deliver our products via ocean transportation could be adversely impacted by shortages in available cargo capacity changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling pricing payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel taxes and labor disruptions to ports and other shipping facilities as a result of the coronavirus or other epidemics and other factors such as labor strikes and work stoppages not within our control if we are unable to use ocean transportation and are required to substitute more expensive air transportation our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted

we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers 

while we are developing our own internal manufacturing capabilities we rely upon our contract manufacturers to manufacture all of our products we mainly rely on two contract manufacturers any change in our relationship with our contract manufacturers or changes to contractual terms of our agreements with the contract manufacturers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs even once we begin manufacturing in our facility in northern israel the expected production volumes will not be sufficient to relive our significant dependence on our contract manufacturers in addition we will remain heavily dependent on suppliers of the components needed for our manufacturing

the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues as a result fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner in addition the facilities in which our products are manufactured are located outside of the us currently in china vietnam and hungary the location of these facilities outside of key markets such as the us increases shipping time thereby causing a long lead time between manufacturing and delivery

if any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers an alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms including price any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers or increase our shipping costs to make up for delays in manufacturing which in turn could reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers and damage our reputation with local installers and potential endusers and cause us to forego potential revenue opportunities

we may experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations 

our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise such processes involve a number of precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched identified and properly addressed and rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques andor expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased warranty reserve increased production and logistical costs and delays any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for key components and raw materials in our products to adequately meet anticipated demand due to the limited number of such suppliers any cessation of operations or production or any shortage delay price change imposition of tariffs or duties or other limitation on our ability to obtain the components and raw materials we use could result in sales delays higher costs associated with air shipments cancellations and loss of market share 

we depend on limited or single source suppliers for certain key components and raw materials used to manufacture our products making us susceptible to quality issues shortages and price changes any of these limited or single source suppliers could stop producing our components or supplying our raw materials cease operations or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with one or more of our competitors as a result these suppliers could stop selling to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all because there are a limited number of suppliers of solar pv system components emobility components and raw materials used to manufacture our products including for manufacturing lithiumion batteries it may be difficult to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative components or raw materials on commercially reasonable terms and our ability to satisfy customer demand may be adversely affected transitioning to a new supplier or redesigning a product to accommodate a new component manufacturer would result in additional costs and delays these outcomes could harm our business or financial performance

managing our supplier and contractor relationships is particularly difficult when we are introducing new products and when demand for our products is increasing especially if demand increases more quickly than we expect

any interruption in the supply of limited source components or raw materials for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers could result in lost revenue or higher expenses associated with increased air shipments required to meet customer demand in a timely manner and would harm our business

for example during 2017 2018 and to a lesser extent in 2019 the solar industry suffered from component shortages which affected our ability to timely receive components within lead time and caused an extension of certain lead times by our suppliers this shortages resulted in a delay in cost reduction activities which negatively impacted our gross margin as well as necessitated expedited air shipments that had an impact on our operating margins

failure by our contract manufacturers or our component or raw material suppliers to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations may adversely affect our business 

we do not control our contract manufacturers or suppliers or their business practices accordingly we cannot guarantee that they follow ethical business practices such as fair wage practices and compliance with environmental safety and other local laws a lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative manufacturers or suppliers which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products product shortages or other disruptions of our operations violation of labor or other laws by our manufacturers or suppliers or the divergence of a supplier’s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the us or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and harm our business

our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter which could make our future performance difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations for a particular period to fall below expectations resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock 

our quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the future we have experienced seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in the past as a result of seasonal fluctuations in our customers’ business for example our customers’ and endusers’ ability to install solar energy systems is affected by weather as for example during the winter months in europe and the northeastern us such installation delays can impact the timing of orders for our products further given that we are operating in an industry that is affected by fluctuations as a result of economic factors such as tariff changes the true extent of these fluctuations may have been masked by our recent growth rates and consequently may not be readily apparent from our historical results of operations and may be difficult to predict our financial performance sales working capital requirements and cash flow may fluctuate and our past quarterly results of operations may not be good indicators of future performance any substantial decrease in revenues would have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price

we rely on distributors and large installers to assist in selling our products and the failure of these customers to perform as expected could reduce our future revenue 

we currently sell a substantial percentage of our products through distributors who in turn sell to local installers and through direct sales to large installers we do not have exclusive arrangements with these third party distributors and large installers many of our distributors also market and sell products from our competitors and all of our large installer customers also use products from our competitors these distributors and large installers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and with little or no notice further these distributors and large installers may fail to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors termination of agreements with current distributors or large installers failure by these distributors or large installers to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new distributor or large installer relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and results of operations

the loss of one or more members of our senior management team or other key personnel or our failure to attract additional qualified personnel may adversely affect our business and our ability to achieve our anticipated level of growth 

we depend on the continued services of our senior management team including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and other key personnel each of whom would be difficult to replace the loss of any such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to implement our business strategy in august 2019 we announced the untimely death of mr guy sella our chairman chief executive officer and cofounder while the company’s short term performance has continued as planned and on target we cannot ensure that his loss will not negatively impact the long term strategy execution and continued innovative planning of our company which was led in large part by him

all of our employees including our senior management are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time we do not maintain keyperson insurance for any of our employees including senior management

additionally our ability to attract qualified personnel including senior management and key technical personnel is critical to the execution of our growth strategy competition for qualified senior management personnel and highly skilled individuals with technical expertise is extremely intense and we face challenges identifying hiring and retaining qualified personnel in all areas of our business in addition integrating new employees into our team could prove disruptive to our operations require substantial resources and management attention and ultimately prove unsuccessful our failure to attract and retain qualified senior management and other key technical personnel could limit or delay our strategic efforts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects

if we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and unfair competition laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions with our customers suppliers employees and others to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we may be subject to claims that our ip rights are invalid or not enforceable our assertion of ip rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us which could harm our business our inability to enforce our ip rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and business

we have applied for patents in the us europe and china some of which have been issued we cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology and any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to among other things rebrand or redesign our affected products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the us we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated infringed or otherwise violated

our intellectual property may be stolen or infringed upon in fact as further detailed in item 3 – “legal proceedings” we are engaged in a number of legal proceedings related to intellectual property litigation proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings may occur including monetary damages or injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products or requiring other remedies these lawsuits are intended to protect our significant investment in our intellectual property but they also may consume management and financial resources for long periods of time and may not result in favorable outcome for us which may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert management’s attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate 

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry from time to time we may also be subject to claims of intellectual property right infringement and related litigation and if we gain greater recognition in the market we face a higher risk of being the subject of claims that we have violated others’ intellectual property rights for example in september 2018 our german subsidiary solaredge technologies gmbh received a complaint filed by sma solar technology ag the complaint filed in the district court düsseldorf germany alleges that solaredges 125kw  276kw inverters infringe two of plaintiff’s patents in november 2019 the first instance court accepted the claim of infringement for one of the two patents and we have filed an appeal to the appeals court dusseldorf and are challenging the validity of the allegedly infringed patent in the german patent court also in november 2019 the first instance court stayed the infringement proceedings regarding the other one of the two patents since it considered it to be highly likely that the patent would be invalid although we are certain that we have meritorious defenses to the claims responding to such claims can be time consuming can divert management’s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses in litigation or settlement while we believe that our products and technology do not infringe in any material respect upon any valid intellectual property rights of third parties we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims if we do not successfully defend or settle an intellectual property claim we could be liable for significant monetary damages and could be prohibited from continuing to use certain technology business methods content or brands to avoid a prohibition we could seek a license from the applicable third party which could require us to pay significant royalties increasing our operating expenses if a license is not available at all or not available on reasonable terms we may be required to develop or license a nonviolating alternative either of which could require significant effort and expense if we cannot license or develop a nonviolating alternative we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our offerings and may be unable to effectively compete any of these results would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

we may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees which could result in litigation and adversely affect our business 

we enter into agreements with our employees pursuant to which they agree that any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement are assigned to us or owned exclusively by us depending on the jurisdiction without the employee retaining any rights a significant portion of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees in the course of their employment for us under the israeli patent law 57271967 the “patent law” inventions conceived by an employee during the scope of his or her employment with a company are regarded as “service inventions” which belong to the employer absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer giving the employee service invention rights the patent law also provides that if there is no such agreement between an employer and an employee the israeli compensation and royalties committee the “committee” a body constituted under the patent law shall determine whether the employee is entitled to remuneration for his or her inventions recent decisions by the committee and the israeli supreme court have created uncertainty in this area as the israeli supreme court held that employees may be entitled to remuneration for their service inventions despite having specifically waived any such rights further the committee has not yet determined the method for calculating this committeeenforced remuneration although our employees have agreed that any rights related to their inventions are owned exclusively by us we may face claims demanding remuneration in consideration for such acknowledgement as a consequence of such claims we could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to our current andor former employees or be forced to litigate such claims which could negatively affect our business

the loss of or events affecting one of our major customer could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

for the year ended december 31 2019 our major customer which is also our largest customer was consolidated electrical distributors inc ced and accounted for 204 of our revenues our next five largest customers for the year ended december 31 2019 together accounted for 291 of our revenues our customers’ decisions to purchase our products are influenced by a number of factors outside of our control including retail energy prices and government regulation and incentives among others in addition these customers may decide to no longer use our products and services for other reasons which may be out of our control although we have agreements with some of our largest customers these agreements do not have longterm purchase commitments and are generally terminable by either party after a relatively short notice period the loss of or events affecting one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

consolidations in the solar industry among our current or potential customers or distributors may adversely affect our competitive position 

there has been an increase in consolidation activity among distributors large installers and other strategic partners in the solar industry for example in june 2016 tesla motors tsla announced that it had submitted a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of solarcity corporation in june 2018 enphase energy enph announced its acquisition of sunpower’s spwr microinverter business this trend could further increase our reliance on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales and may negatively impact our competitive position in the solar market

our planned expansion into new geographic markets or new product lines or services could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks 

in the year ended december 31 2019 we sold our products in different countries including the us belgium france germany israel italy the netherlands the united kingdom australia japan korea sweden poland and brazil among others we have in the past and may in the future evaluate opportunities to expand into new geographic markets and introduce new product offerings and services that are a natural extension of our existing business we also may from time to time engage in acquisitions of businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our market position enable us to enter attractive markets expand our technological capabilities or provide synergy opportunities for example we intend to continue to introduce new products targeted at large commercial and utilityscale installations and to continue to expand into other international markets

our success operating in these new geographic or product markets or in operating any acquired business will depend on a number of factors including our ability to develop solutions to address the requirements of the large commercial and utilityscale solar pv markets timely qualification and certification of new products for large commercial and utilityscale solar pv installations acceptance of power optimizers in solar pv markets in which they have not traditionally been used our ability to manage increased manufacturing capacity and production and our ability to identify and integrate any acquired businesses

further we expect these new solar pv markets and the additional markets we have entered as a result of our recent acquisitions to have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products and our success will depend on our ability to adapt properly to these differences these differences may include differing regulatory requirements including tax laws trade laws labor regulations tariffs export quotas customs duties or other trade restrictions limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection international political or economic conditions restrictions on the repatriation of earnings longer sales cycles warranty expectations product return policies and cost performance and compatibility requirements in addition expanding into new geographic markets will increase our exposure to presently existing risks such as fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and difficulties and increased expenses in complying with us and foreign laws regulations and trade standards including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” 

failure to develop and introduce these new products successfully to successfully integrate acquired businesses or to otherwise manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to sustain profitability

if we fail to manage our recent and future growth effectively we may be unable to execute our business plan maintain high levels of customer service or adequately address competitive challenges 

we have experienced significant growth in recent periods with our annual product sales growing rapidly from approximately 152500 inverters and approximately 36 million power optimizers in the fiscal year ending june 30 2015 to annual product sales exceeding 664000 inverters and 157 million power optimizers in the year ended december 31 2019 we intend to continue to expand our business significantly within existing and new markets this growth has placed and any future growth may place a significant strain on our management operational and financial infrastructure in particular we will be required to expand train and manage our growing employee base and scale and otherwise improve our it infrastructure in tandem with that headcount growth our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers as well as manage multiple geographic locations

our current and planned operations personnel customer support it information systems and other systems and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth and may require us to make additional unanticipated investment in our infrastructure our success and ability to further scale our business will depend in part on our ability to manage these changes in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot manage our growth we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures this could also result in declines in quality or customer satisfaction increased costs difficulties in introducing new offerings or other operational difficulties any failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our business and reputation

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

although our financial results are reported in us dollars 487 of our revenues in the year ended december 31 2019 were generated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition a significant portion of our operating expenses are accrued in new israeli shekels primarily related to payroll and to a lesser extent the euro and other currencies our profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and to a lesser extent the new israeli shekel korean won and other currencies in which we generate revenues incur expenses and maintain cash balances foreign currency fluctuations may also affect the prices of our products our prices are denominated primarily in us dollars if there is a significant devaluation of a particular currency the prices of our products will increase relative to the local currency and may be less competitive despite our efforts to minimize foreign currency risks primarily by maintaining cash balances in new israeli shekels significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values in particular a significant change in the relative values of the euro and to a lesser extent the new israeli shekel korean won and other currencies against the us dollar could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition

from time to time we may enter into forward contracts to hedge the exchange impacts on assets and liabilities denominated in israeli shekels euros and other currencies as of december 31 2019 we had no derivative instruments we may use derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts and put and call options to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on accounts receivable and forecast cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies we may not be able to purchase derivative instruments adequate to fully insulate ourselves from foreign currency exchange risks

additionally our hedging activities may also contribute to increased losses as a result of volatility in foreign currency markets if foreign exchange currency markets continue to be volatile such fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations in future periods also the volatility in the foreign currency markets may make it difficult to hedge our foreign currency exposures effectively

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain like many other multinational corporations we are subject to tax in multiple jurisdictions both in the us and outside the us our determination of our tax liability may be subject to audit and review by applicable tax authorities any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could affect our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities these reserves may prove to be insufficient

in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated or by the incurrence of losses in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items

various levels of government such as us federal and state legislatures and international organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” and the european union are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax rate and may even create a double taxation event

any unauthorized access to or disclosure or theft of personal information we gather store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation 

our business and operations may be impacted by data security breaches and cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to confidential data we receive store and use certain personal information of our customers and the endusers of our customers’ solar pv systems including names addresses email addresses credit information and energy production statistics we also store and use personal information of our employees we take steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the personal information we collect store and transmit however we have been subject to cybersecurity attacks and other information technology system disruptions in the past and there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we and our suppliers or vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures 

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee or contractor error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business particularly in light of the european general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act which came into effect january 1 2020 if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information were to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws 

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws however we currently operate in and intend to further expand into many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our entry into certain jurisdictions requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from us standards it is possible that our employees subcontractors agents and partners may take actions in violation of our policies and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us to criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation

third parties might attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network or seek to compromise our products and services 

from time to time we face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology it systems additionally malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide we or our products may be a target of computer hackers organizations or malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products employees and customers or interrupt our systems or those of our customers or others from time to time we encounter intrusions or attempts at gaining unauthorized access to our network to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations however there can be no guarantee that such impacts will not be material in the future while we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network and products and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools andor changes to our products we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats in addition to intentional thirdparty cybersecurity breaches the integrity and confidentiality of company and customer data may be compromised as a result of human error product defects or technological failures cybersecurity breaches whether successful or unsuccessful and other it system interruptions including those resulting from human error and technological failures could result in our incurring significant costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems reduced inventory value providing modifications to our products and services defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties

our entry into business engagements with military bodies as our customers in the lithiumion battery and energy storage business embodies a risk for potentially largescale and uncapped liability 

as a result of the kokam acquisition a small portion of our business involves the sale of products to military customers our sales to military customers often involve standard form contracts which are less subject to negotiation than the agreements we enter into in our ordinary course of business in particular certain of these contracts involve unlimited damages provisions that could result in largescale liabilities

we may not have sufficient insurance coverage to cover business continuity 

we rely on a limited number of contracted manufacturers to manufacture our products as well as on component manufacturers which are sometimes a single source as a result a sustained or repeated interruption in the manufacturing of our products by such outsourced providers due to fire flood war pandemic or nature disasters andor an interruption in the provision of the required components for our business by these components manufacturers may interfere with our ability to sell our products to our customers in a timely manner the described nature of our business and our size makes it difficult to insure some or all of such possible loss of profit which may adversely affect our financial results

our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments in particular we may not succeed in making additional acquisitions or be effective in integrating such acquisitions 

as part of our growth strategy we have made a significant number of acquisitions we may continue to make acquisitions and investments in the future as part of our growth strategy we frequently evaluate the tactical or strategic opportunities available related to complementary businesses products or technologies there can be no assurance that we will be successful in making additional acquisitions even if we are successful in making additional acquisitions integrating an acquired company’s business into our operations or investing in new technologies may 1 result in unforeseen operating difficulties and large expenditures and 2 absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business both of which may result in the loss of key customers or personnel and expose us to unanticipated liabilities further we may not be able to retain the key employees that may be necessary to operate the business we acquire and we may not be able to attract in a timely manner new skilled employees and management to replace them

we may not be able to consummate acquisitions or investments that we have identified as crucial to the implementation of our strategy for other commercial or economic reasons further we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals including those of competition authorities and foreign investment authorities in countries where we seek to consummate acquisitions or make investments for those and other reasons we may ultimately fail to consummate an acquisition even if we announce the intended acquisition

if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected 

due to our latest acquisitions goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 2037 million or approximately 136 of our total assets as of december 31 2019 we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment and we assess on an asneeded basis whether there have been impairments in our other intangible assets we make assumptions and estimates in this assessment which are complex and often subjective these assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts to the extent that the factors described above change we could be required to record additional noncash impairment charges in the future which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the manufacturing assembly storage transportation and disposal of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate such as rohs restriction of hazardous substance reach registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals weee waste electrical and electronic equipment directive conflict minerals regulation california’s proposition 65 known as the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 kreach korean reach and more failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in regulatory fines penalties and legal liabilities suspension of production of our products adjustments or alterations to our manufacturing processes and damage to our reputation all of which may adversely impact our business and financial condition and result of operations

lithiumion used in our battery cells and packs can potentially catch fire or vent smoke and cause damage or injury 

the battery cells and packs produced by our subsidiary kokam make use of lithiumion cells we regularly test our products and take safety measures when manufacturing selling and installing battery cells and packs however due to the high energy density of lithiumion cells mishandling inappropriate storage noncompliance with safety instructions or field failures can potentially cause a battery cell to rapidly release its stored energy which may in turn cause a thermal event that can ignite nearby materials including other lithiumion cells as the use of lithiumion batteries becomes more widespread these events may occur more often causing damage to property injury lawsuits and adverse publicity which may adversely affect our reputation results of operations or financial condition

risks related to operations in israel 

conditions in israel affect our operations and may limit our ability to develop produce and sell our products 

although we are incorporated in delaware our headquarters and research and development center are located in israel accordingly political economic and military conditions in israel directly affect us israel has been involved in a number of armed conflicts and has been the target of terrorist activity ongoing state of hostility varying in degree such as rocket fire from the gaza strip including against civilian targets has occurred on an irregular basis disrupting daytoday civilian activity and negatively affecting business conditions israel also faces threats from hezbollah militants in lebanon and others we cannot predict whether or when such armed conflicts or attacks may occur or the extent to which such events may impact us any future armed conflict political instability or violence in the region may impede our ability to manage our business effectively or to engage in research and development or may otherwise adversely affect our business or operations in the event of war we may be forced to cease operations which may cause delays in the distribution and sale of our products some of our directors executive officers and employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and are subject to being called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances in the event that our principal executive office is damaged as a result of hostile action or hostilities otherwise disrupting the ongoing operation of our offices our ability to operate could be materially adversely affected 

additionally several countries principally in the middle east restrict doing business with israeli companies and additional countries and groups may impose similar restrictions if hostilities in israel or political instability in the region continue or increase if recent regime changes and civil wars in neighboring states result in the establishment of fundamentalist islamic regimes or governments more hostile to israel or if egypt or jordan abrogates its respective peace treaty with israel israel could be subject to additional political economic and military confines and our operations and ability to sell our products to countries in the region could be materially adversely affected these restrictions may limit materially our ability to obtain manufactured components and raw materials or to sell our products 

any hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners or significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the tax benefits that are available to us under israeli law require us to meet various conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future which could increase our costs and taxes 

our israeli subsidiary was eligible for certain tax benefits provided to “benefited enterprises” under the israeli law for the encouragement of capital investments 1959 the “investments law” beginning in january 2019 and with respect to its taxable results from 2019 onwards our israeli subsidiary further elected to apply the terms of the investments law as per “preferred enterprise” or “preferred technological enterprise” “pte” in order to remain eligible for the tax benefits for “benefited enterprises” with respect to our israeli subsidiary’s taxable results until 2018 and with respect to its taxable results from 2019 for “preferred enterprise” or “preferred technological enterprise” we must continue to meet certain conditions stipulated in the investments law and its regulations as amended if these tax benefits are reduced cancelled or discontinued our israeli taxable income would be subject to regular israeli corporate tax rates and we may be required to refund any tax benefits that we have already received plus interest and penalties thereon the standard corporate tax rate for israeli companies was 24 in 2017 and decreased further to 23 as of january 1 2018 and onward additionally if we increase our activities outside of israel through acquisitions or otherwise through our israeli subsidiary our existing or expanded activities might not be eligible for inclusion in existing or future israeli tax benefit programs the israeli government may furthermore independently determine to reduce phase out or eliminate entirely the benefit programs under the investments law regardless of whether we then qualify for benefits under those programs at the time which would also adversely affect our global tax rate and our results of operations 

it may be difficult to enforce a judgment of a us court against our officers and directors to assert us securities laws claims in israel or to serve process on our officers and directors 

the majority of our directors and executive officers reside outside of the us and most of our assets and most of the assets of these persons are located outside of the us consequently a judgment obtained against any of these persons including a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws may not be collectible in the us it also may be difficult for you to effect service of process on these persons in the us or to assert us securities law claims in original actions instituted in israel israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of us securities laws on the grounds that israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim in addition even if an israeli court hears a claim it may determine that israeli law and not us law is applicable to the claim if us law is found to be applicable the content of applicable us law must be proven as a fact by expert witnesses which can be a time consuming and costly process further an israeli court may not enforce a judgment awarded by a us or other nonisraeli court certain matters of procedure will also be governed by israeli law there is little binding case law in israel that addresses these matters as a result of the difficulty associated with enforcing a judgment against any of these persons in israel you may not be able to obtain or enforce a judgment against many of our directors and executive officers

•

changes in accounting principles 

further the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies in addition the stock prices of many renewable energy companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial cost and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

the price of our common stock could decline if securities analysts or other third parties publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or if one or more of our analysts ceases to cover us or to regularly publish reports about us 

the trading of our common stock is likely to be influenced by the reports and research that industry or securities analysts publish about us our business our market or our competitors if one or more securities or industry analysts downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price would likely decline if one or more securities or industry analysts ceases to cover the company or fails to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may believe advantageous these provisions include 

•

authorizing “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt 

•

providing for a classified board of directors with staggered threeyear terms which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors

•

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in june and july 2018 we filed three lawsuits for patent infringement against huawei technologies co ltd a chinese entity huawei technologies düsseldorf gmbh a german entity and wattkraft solar gmbh a german distributor for huawei the lawsuits filed in the mannheim district court in germany assert unauthorized use of patented technology and are intended to protect solaredge’s significant investment in its innovative dc optimized inverter technology seeking monetary damages an injunction and recall of infringing huawei inverters from the german market the lawsuit is intended to prevent the defendants from selling any multilevel inverters infringing upon solaredge’s pv inverter technology protected in the asserted patents in germany in november 2019 one of the patents underlying one of the lawsuits was revoked by the european patent office and as such the relevant parallel infringement proceedings have been stayed in the other two lawsuits hearings were held and in one of the proceedings the claim was dismissed and we have appealed to a higher court the third lawsuit is pending a court appointed expert opinion we intend to continue to vigorously fight to protect our patented technology 

in may 2019 we were served with three lawsuits by huawei technologies co ltd a chinese entity “huawei” against the companys two chinese subsidiaries and its equipment manufacturer in china the lawsuits filed in the guangzhou intellectual property court allege infringement of three patents and ask for an injunction of manufacture use sale and offer for sale and damage awards of approximately 43 million we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted by huawei and intend to continue to vigorously defend against these lawsuits 

in october 2019 we announced that we filed three lawsuits in china against huawei the lawsuits filed in the regional courts of jinan and shenzhen in china cite unauthorized use of patented technology and are intended to protect solaredge’s significant investment in its innovative dc optimized inverter technology seeking damages and an injunction the lawsuits are intended to prevent huawei from manufacturing and selling any products infringing upon solaredge’s patented pv inverter and power optimizer technology 

in september 2018 our german subsidiary solaredge technologies gmbh received a complaint filed by a competitor sma solar technology ag “sma” the complaint filed in the district court düsseldorf germany alleges that solaredges 125kw  276kw inverters infringe two of plaintiff’s patents in its complaint sma requests inter alia an injunction and a determination for a claim for damages for sales in germany sma also asserts a value in dispute of five million euros for both patents in november 2019 the first instance court accepted the claim of infringement for one of the two patents and we have filed an appeal to the appeals court dusseldorf and are challenging the validity of the allegedly infringed patent in the german patent court also in november 2019 the first instance court stayed the infringement proceedings regarding the other one of the two patents since it considered it to be highly likely that the patent would be invalid we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit 

in august 2019 we were served with a lawsuit by certain former shareholders of smre against the company’s italian subsidiary that purchased the shares of smre in the tender offer which followed the smre acquisition the lawsuit asks for damages of approximately 3 million representing the difference between the amount for which they tendered their shares 6 euro per share and 67 euros per share we believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit 

in addition in the normal course of business we may from time to time be named as a party to various legal claims actions and complaints including as a result of initiating such legal claims action or complaints on behalf of the company it is impossible to predict with certainty whether any resulting liability would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the sections of this annual report on form 10k captioned “selected financial data” and “business” and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form 10k in addition to historical financial information the following discussion and analysis contains forward‑looking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward‑looking statements as a result of many factors including those discussed under the sections of this annual report captioned “special note regarding forward‑looking statements” and “risk factors” 

overview 

established in 2006 we developed a dc optimized inverter solution that changed the way power is harvested and managed in photovoltaic known as pv systems our direct current or dc optimized inverter system maximizes power generation while lowering the cost of energy produced by the pv system for improved return on investment or roi additional benefits of the dc optimized inverter system include providing comprehensive and advanced safety features improved design flexibility and improved operating and maintenance or om with modulelevel and remote monitoring the typical solaredge optimized inverter system consists of our inverters power optimizers a communication device which enables access to a cloud based monitoring platform and in many cases additional smart energy management solutions our solutions address a broad range of solar market segments from residential solar installations to commercial and small utility‑scale solar installations since we began commercial shipments in 2010 we have shipped approximately 162 gigawatts “gw” of our dc optimized inverter systems and our products have been installed in solar pv systems in 133 countries 

since introducing the optimized inverter solution in 2010 solaredge has expanded its activity to other areas of smart energy technology both through organic growth and through acquisitions by leveraging worldclass engineering capabilities and with a relentless focus on innovation solaredge now offers energy solutions which include not only residential commercial and large scale pv systems but also product offerings in the areas of energy storage systems or ess and backup electric vehicle or ev components and charging capabilities home energy management grid services and virtual power plants lithiumion batteries and uninterrupted power supply known as ups solutions 

we are a leader in the global modulelevel power electronics market according to ihs and as of december 31 2019 we have shipped approximately 499 million power optimizers and 21 million inverters more than 138 million installations many of which may include multiple inverters are currently connected to and monitored through our cloud‑based monitoring platform as of december 31 2019 we have shipped approximately 162 gw of our dc optimized inverter systems 

we primarily sell our products directly to large solar installers epcs and indirectly to thousands of smaller solar installers through large distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers our sales strategy focuses on top‑tier customers in markets where electricity prices irradiance amount of sunlight and government policies make solar pv installations economically viable we also sell our power optimizers to several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules 

in the year ended december 31 2019 one customer accounted for 204 of our revenues and our top three customers all distributors together represented 354 of our revenues today we address a broad range of energy market segments through our diversified product offering including residential commercial and large scale pv energy storage and backup solutions emobility home energy management grid services and virtual power plants batteries and uninterrupted power supply ups solutions 

our revenues were 6070 million 9372 million and 14257 million for fiscal 2017 fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 respectively gross margins were 354 341 and 336 for fiscal 2017 fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 respectively net profits were 842 million 1288 million and 1465 million fiscal 2017 fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 respectively 

we continue to focus on our long‑term growth and profitability we believe that our market opportunity is large and that the transition from traditional inverter architecture to dc optimized inverter architecture will continue as the architecture of choice for distributed solar installations globally we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this market trend additionally we are expanding our offering with products such as storage inverters for increased selfconsumption and backup evcharging inverters smart meters smart energy devices sockets water heater controllers wireless relay aimed to increase our average revenue per installation arpi we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to acquire new customers in our existing markets and in adjacent markets grow internationally and drive additional revenue we aim to increase market share in the ci segment and penetrate the utility segment through specialized product development we expect to continue to invest in research and development to enhance our product offerings and develop new costeffective solutions 

we believe that our strategy for continued growth in the solar market results in an efficient operating base with relatively low expenses that will enable profitability on lower revenues relative to our competitors we believe that our sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long‑term as we continue to grow due to economies of scale with this increased operating leverage we expect our gross and operating margins to increase in the longterm with respect to our penetration of nonsolar businesses in which we have invested we expect that we will need to make significant research and development sales and marketing investments before making those businesses profitable 

performance measures 

in managing our business and assessing financial performance we supplement the information provided by the financial statements with other operating metrics these operating metrics are utilized by our management to evaluate our business measure our performance identify trends affecting our business and formulate projections we use metrics relating to yearly shipments inverters shipped power optimizers shipped and megawatts shipped to evaluate our sales performance and to track market acceptance of our products from year to year we use metrics relating to monitoring systems monitored and megawatts monitored to evaluate market acceptance of our products and usage of our solution 

we provide the “megawatts shipped” metric which is calculated based on nameplate capacity shipped to show adoption of our system on a nameplate capacity basis nameplate capacity shipped is the maximum rated power output capacity of an inverter and corresponds to our financial results in that higher total capacities shipped are generally associated with higher total revenues however revenues increase with each additional unit not necessarily each additional mw of capacity sold accordingly we also provide the “inverters shipped” and “power optimizers shipped” operating metrics 

key components of our results of operations 

the following discussion describes certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations 

revenues 

we generate revenues from the sale of dc optimized inverter systems for solar pv installations which include power optimizers inverters ev chargers smart energy devices our cloud‑based monitoring platform as well as grid services our customer base mainly includes distributors large solar installers wholesalers epcs and pv module manufacturers in addition following our recent acquisitions we also generate revenues from the sale of lithiumion cells batteries and energy storage solutions ups systems machinery and ev powertrain solutions for electric vehicles 

our revenues from the sale of solarrelated products are affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our dc optimized inverter systems the volume and average selling price of our systems is driven by the supply and demand for our products changes in the product mix between our residential and commercial products the customer mix between large and small customers the geographical mix of our sales sales incentives end‑user government incentives seasonality and competitive product offerings revenues from the sale of kokam’s products are affected by the type of product sold cell battery or system and the type of the battery that is sold revenues from the sale of ups products and smre products are affected by the changes in the volumes customers’ size and average selling prices of the products we sell 

our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to expand our market share in each of the geographies in which we compete expand our global footprint to new evolving markets grow our production capabilities to meet demand continue to develop and introduce new and innovative products that address the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers and expansion of the new businesses we acquired 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues consists primarily of product costs including purchases from our contract manufacturers and other suppliers as well as costs related to shipping customer support product warranty personnel depreciation of test and manufacturing equipment hosting services for our cloud‑based monitoring platform and other logistics services our product costs are affected by technological innovations such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions economies of scale resulting in lower component costs and improvements in production processes and automation some of these costs primarily personnel and depreciation of test and manufacturing equipment are not directly affected by sales volume

with respect to liion batteries cost of revenues consists primarily of materials costs labor costs associated with the manufacturing variable utility and operational costs related to the cell and battery factories depreciation and other fixed costs

except for the manufacturing and assembly activities related to our newly acquired businesses we outsource our manufacturing to third‑party manufacturers and negotiate product pricing on a quarterly basis our third‑party manufacturers are responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products except with regard to endofline testing equipment and the automated assembly lines for our power optimizers and the equipment for the manufacturing of subassemblies as further described below which resulted in capital expenditures of 136 million 90 million and 232 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the year ended december 31 2018 and the year ended december 31 2019 respectively we expect to continue this funding arrangement in the future with respect to any expansions to such existing lines we also procure strategic and critical components from various approved vendors on behalf of our contract manufacturers in fiscal 2019 higher than anticipated demand for our solar products has exceeded the production capacities of these manufacturers and we were required to use air freight rather than less expensive ocean freight to deliver the majority of our products the expansion of current manufacturing sites by our contract manufacturers as well as our own manufacturing site is anticipated to allow us to reduce these expenses in 2020 as well as to build sufficient inventory to continue our growth without the need to ship substantial amounts of products by air

in 2017 2018 and 2019 global shortages in power components used in our products and in other industries such as electrical motor drives and uninterrupted power systems ups caused disruptions to our ongoing manufacturing this phenomenon combined with increased demand for our products required us to use expensive air shipments in order to meet our delivery schedule which negatively affected our gross profit we expect component shortages to continue to affect us in upcoming quarters a combination of increased component safety stocks qualification of additional suppliers and increased capacity of our existing vendors coupled with continued expansion of the current manufacturing sites by our contract manufacturers and the development and deployment of our proprietary automated assembly line described below will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our forecasted demands with lower shipment volumes of products by air freight 

we completed development and manufacturing our proprietary automated assembly lines for our power optimizers additionally we manufacture subassemblies such as cables and magnetics and own significant amounts of equipment in connection with such manufacturing activities we expect to continue to invest in additional automated assembly lines in the future we have designed and are responsible for funding all of the capital expenses associated with existing and future automated assembly lines the current and expected capital expenses associated with these automated assembly lines will be funded out of our cash flows generation

key components of our logistics supply channel consist of third party distribution centers in the us europe australia and japan finished goods are either shipped to our customers directly from our contract manufacturers or shipped to thirdparty distribution centers and then finally shipped to our customers

cost of revenues also includes our operations and support department costs the operations department is responsible for production management such as planning procurement supply chain production methodologies and machinery planning logistics management and manufacturing support to our contract manufacturers as well as the quality assurance of our products our support department provides customer and technical support at various levels through our call centers around the world as well as second and thirdlevel support services which are provided by support personnel located in our headquarters our full‑time employee headcount in our operations production and support departments has grown from 348 as of december 31 2017 to 663 as of december 31 2018 and to 1031 as of december 31 2019

part of the increase in our cost of revenues is derived from an increase in tariffs on chinese made products sold in the us 

gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices product costs product mix customer mix geographical mix shipping method warranty costs and seasonality

operating expenses 

operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing general and administrative and other expenses personnel‑related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories and include salaries benefits payroll taxes commissions and stock‑based compensation our full‑time employee headcount in our research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative departments has grown from 660 as of december 31 2017 to 1074 to as of december 31 2018 and to 1400 as of december 31 2019 we expect to continue to hire significant numbers of new employees to support our growth the timing of these additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses in any particular period both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue we expect to continue to invest substantial resources to support our growth and anticipate that each of the following categories of operating expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts for the foreseeable future

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses include personnel‑related expenses such as salaries benefits stock‑based compensation and payroll taxes our research and development employees are engaged in the design and development of power electronics semiconductors software power line communications networking and chemistry our research and development expenses also include third‑party design and consulting costs materials for testing and evaluation asic development and licensing costs depreciation expense and other indirect costs we devote substantial resources to ongoing research and development programs that focus on enhancements to and cost efficiencies in our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation thereby maintaining our competitive position 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel‑related expenses such as salaries sales commissions benefits payroll taxes and stock‑based compensation these expenses also include travel fees of independent consultants trade shows marketing costs associated with the operation of our sales offices and other indirect costs the expected increase in sales and marketing expenses is due to an expected increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel and the expansion of our global sales and marketing footprint enabling us to increase our penetration of new markets in the year ended december 31 2019 382 of our revenues were generated from europe 476 of our revenues are generated from the usa and 142 of our revenues are generated from row in the year ended december 31 2018 32 of our revenues were generated from europe 539 of our revenues are generated from the usa and 141 of our revenues were generated from row in the year ended december 31 2017 327 of our revenues were generated from europe 575 of our revenues were generated from the usa and 98 of our revenues were generated from row we currently have a sales presence in the us canada france germany italy the netherlands the united kingdom israel turkey japan australia china sweden poland india belgium korea brazil and taiwan we intend to continue to expand our sales presence to additional countries 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits and stock‑based compensation related to our executives finance human resources information technology and legal organizations travel expenses facilities costs fees for professional services and registration fees related to being a publiclytraded company professional services consist of audit and legal costs remuneration to board members insurance information technology and other costs general and administrative expenses also include allowance for doubtful accounts in the event of uncollectable account receivables balances

other expenses 

other expenses consist primarily of losses related to the sale of an smre subsidiary originally acquired as part of the smre acquisition stock‑based compensation related to the untimely death of mr guy sella our founder who had served as ceo and chairman of the board of directors until shortly before his passing on august 25 2019 modification of psus terms originally granted as part of the smre acquisition and a legal claim acquired as part of the kokam acquisition which was settled in arbitration 

nonoperating expenses 

financial income expenses

our functional currency is the us dollar with respect to certain of our subsidiaries the functional currency is the applicable local currency financial expenses net is net of financial income which consists primarily of the effect of foreign exchange differences between the us dollar and the new israeli shekel the euro the korean won and other currencies related to our monetary assets and liabilities and the realization of gain from hedging transactions 

taxes on income 

we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we operate

in the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded net income tax expenses of 198 million for federal and state tax in the us which consists of 199 million current income tax expenses and 01 million deferred tax in the year ended december 31 2018 we recorded net income tax expenses of 126 million for federal and state tax in the us which consists of 139 million current income tax expenses and 13 million deferred tax benefit in the year ended december 31 2019 we recorded net income tax expenses of 67 million for federal and state tax in the us which consists of 101 million current income tax expenses and 34 million deferred tax benefit

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was signed into law making significant changes to us income tax law these changes include but are not limited to a corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 effective for tax years 2018 onwards created new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings and certain relatedparty payments 

due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the tax act we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2017 as we collected and prepared necessary data and interpreted the additional guidance issued by the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies we made adjustments over the course of 2018 to the provisional amounts including refinements to deferred taxes the accounting for the tax effects of the tax act was completed as of december 31 2018 

the tax act required us to pay us income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to us income tax at a rate of 155 to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets and 8 on the remaining earnings the company has elected to pay its transition tax over an eightyear period as provided in the tax act

solaredge technologies ltd our israeli subsidiary is taxed under israeli law income not eligible for benefits under the investments law is taxed at the corporate tax rate amendments of the israeli income tax ordinance new version 1961 the “tax ordinance” decreased the corporate tax rate to 23 command 24 starting january 1 2018 

our israeli subsidiary elected tax year 2012 as a year of election for “benefited enterprise” under the israeli investments law which provides certain benefits including tax exemptions and reduced tax rates income not eligible for benefited enterprise benefits is taxed at the then prevailing regular corporate tax rate upon meeting the requirements under the israeli investments law income derived from productive activity under the benefited enterprise status would subject to certain terms and limits will be exempt from tax for two years from the year in which the israeli subsidiary first generated taxable income because solaredge technologies ltd utilized all of its losses carryforwards in the six months ended in december 31 2016 and as it was granted an approval by the israeli tax authorities “ita” in this regard the twoyear tax exemption has ended on december 31 2018

the investment law was amended in 2005 and was further amended as of january 1 2011 and in august 2013 the “2011 amendment” the 2011 amendment canceled the availability of the benefits granted in accordance with the provisions of the investments law prior to 2011 and instead introduced new benefits for income generated by a “preferred company” through its “preferred enterprise” both as defined in the 2011 amendment under the 2011 amendment income derived by preferred companies from preferred enterprise would be subject to a uniform rate of corporate tax for an unlimited period as opposed to the incentives prior to the 2011 amendment that were limited to income from approved or benefited enterprise during the respective benefits period according to the 2011 amendment considering the rates as amended in the 2017 amendment as defined herein the tax rate applicable to such income referred to as “preferred income” would be 75 in areas in israel that are designated as development zone a and 16 elsewhere in israel in the year 2017 and thereafter under the transitional provisions of the 2011 amendment companies may elect to irrevocably implement the 2011 amendment while waiving benefits provided under the legislation prior to the 2011 amendment or keep implementing the legislation prior to the 2011 amendment

in december 2016 amendment 73 to the investments law the “2017 amendment was published according to the 2017 amendment special tax tracks for technological enterprises have been introduced which are subject to rules that were issued by the israeli ministry of finance a technological preferred enterprise as defined in the 2017 amendment that is located in the central region of israel will be subject to tax at a rate of 12 on profits deriving from intellectual property in development zone a  a tax rate of 75

on june 14 2017 the encouragement of capital investments regulations preferred technological income and capital gain for technological enterprise 2017 the “regulations” were published the regulations describe inter alia the mechanism used to determine the calculation of the benefits under the pte regime and determine certain requirements relating to documentation of intellectual property for the purpose of the pte according to these provisions a company that complies with the terms under the pte regime may be entitled to certain tax benefits with respect to certain income generated during the company’s regular course of business and derived from the preferred intangible asset as determined in the investments law excluding certain portion of income as prescribed therein

as of january 2019 solaredge technologies ltd elected to implement the 2011 and 2017 amendments starting as of tax year 2019 under the pte regime with respect to our business activities in israel we expect that solaredge technologies ltd will be entitled to an effective tax at a rate of 123

our production facilities in israel are not located in development zone a solaredge technologies ltd is in the final stages of developing its own manufacturing facilities in israel which will be located in a development zone a

the law for the encouragement of industry taxes 1969 the “industry encouragement law” provides certain tax benefits for an ‘industrial company’ as such term is defined in the industry encouragement law an industrial company is entitled to certain tax benefits including inter alia i amortization over an eightyear period of the cost of purchased knowhow and patents and rights to use a patent and knowhow which are used for the development or advancement of the company and ii accelerated depreciation rates on equipment and buildings eligibility for benefits under the industry encouragement law is not subject to receipt of prior approval from any governmental authority we believe that our israeli subsidiary currently qualifies as an industrial company however there can be no assurance that it will continue to so qualify or that the benefits described above will be available to it in the future furthermore the ita may determine that we do not qualify as an industrial company which could entail a loss of the benefits that relate to that status

israeli tax law section 20a of the tax ordinance allows under certain conditions a tax deduction for certain research and development expenses as prescribed in the tax ordinance for the year in which they are paid subject to appropriate approval by the relevant israeli government ministry determined by the field of research expenses incurred in scientific research that are not approved by the relevant israeli government ministry will be deductible over a threeyear period commencing from the tax year in which they are paid our israeli subsidiary did not obtain to date such approval

revenues 

 

revenues increased by 4884 million or 521 in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to i an increase in the number of inverters and power optimizers sold with significant growth in revenues coming from europe the us and israel ii price increases on products sold in the us intended to offset the newly imposed tariffs on china made products and iii revenues from the new businesses we acquired which includes sales of ups units batteries storage systems and products sold by smre in an aggregate amount of 890 million in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 230 million in the year ended december 31 2018 revenues from outside of the us comprised 524 of our revenues in 2019 as compared to 461 in 2018 

the number of power optimizers sold increased by approximately 43 million units or 382 from approximately 114 million units in 2018 to approximately 157 million units in 2019 the number of inverters sold increased by approximately 210000 units or 463 from approximately 454000 units in 2018 to approximately 664000 units in 2019 in addition we increased prices in the us in 2019 in order to offset the impact of the increase in tariffs on goods made in china that became effective june 1 2019 this increase in selling prices was partially offset by the devaluation of the euro and the australian dollar compared to the us dollar negatively impacting our us dollar denominated average selling price “asp” overall and primarily due to the factors detailed above our asp per watt for units shipped increased by 0005 or 23 in 2019 compared to 2018 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

 

cost of revenues increased by 3283 million or 531 in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to 

• 

an increase in the volume of products sold 

• 

increased customs tariffs shipment and logistics costs of 677 million attributed to the change in tariff rates on chinese made products imported into the us from 10 to 25 as well as an increase in air shipments due to increased product demand which required us to increase manufacturing capacity and expedite shipments for timely delivery 

•

an increase in warranty expenses and warranty accruals of 243 million associated primarily with the rapid increase of products in our install base this increase was partially offset by various cost reductions on the different elements of our warranty expenses which include the cost of the products shipment and other related expenses 

• 

inclusion of variable costs related to the assembly of ups products manufacturing of kokam and smre products in an aggregate amount of 569 million in 2019 compared to 197 million for 2018 as gamatronic and kokam were partially represented in our results for the year ended december 31 2018 and smre was acquired in january of 2019

lower gross profit from our ups products battery solutions and smre products and underutilization of kokam’s manufacturing facilities 

• 

increased actual support costs related to our warranty obligations and 

• 

amortization of intangible assets and cost of product adjustment related to the gamatronic acquisition the kokam acquisition and the smre acquisition 

these were partially offset by

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “gaap” the preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 

revenue recognition 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted the accounting standards codification 606 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not substantially completed as of january 1 2018 as a result of this adoption we revised our accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed below 

we generate revenues from the sale of dc optimized inverter systems for solar pv installations which include our power optimizers inverters and cloud‑based monitoring platform as well as other solar related products ups systems lithiumion cells batteries energy storage solutions ev powertrain solutions and machinery our worldwide customer base includes large solar installers distributors epcs pv module manufacturers utility companies and other customers our products are fully functional at the time of shipment to the customer and do not require production modification or customization with the exception of some ups and ess systems that require installation and commissioning we recognize revenue under the core principle that transfer of control to the customers should be depicted in an amount reflecting the consideration we expect to receive in revenue in order to achieve that core principle we apply the following fivestep approach 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied provisions for rebates sales incentives and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded 

we generally sell our products to our customers pursuant to a customer’s standard purchase order and our customary terms and conditions we do not offer rights to return our products other than for normal warranty conditions and as such revenue is recorded upon shipment of products to customers and transfer of title and risk of loss under standard commercial terms we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine that appropriate credit limits are established prior to the acceptance and shipment of an order 

we provide our full web‑based monitoring platform for our solar products free of charge and revenues associated with the service since that date are being recognized ratably over 25 years in the absence of third party comparable pricing for such service management determines the revenue levels of this service based on the costs associated with providing the service plus appropriate margins that reflect management’s best estimate of the selling price these revenues are minimal and we do not expect this to become a significant source of revenue in the near future 

the most significant impact of the standard on our financial statements relates to advance payments received for performance obligations that extend for a period greater than one year applying the new standard such performance obligations are those that include a financing component specifically i warranty extension services ii cloudbased monitoring and iii communication services 

we recognize financing component expenses in our consolidated statement of income in relation to advance payments for performance obligations that extend for a period greater than one year these financing component expenses are reflected in our deferred revenues balance the cumulative adjustments have decreased the retained earnings by 39 million while increasing the deferred revenues by the same amount 

product warranty 

we provide a standard limited product warranty for our solar products against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions our standard warranty period is 25 years for our power optimizers 12 years for our inverters and 10 years for our storage interface other products are sold with standard limited warranties that typically range in duration from one to ten years and in some cases for a longer period in certain cases customers can purchase an extended warranty for ups products and our battery storage products that exceed the standard warranty period in addition customers can purchase extended warranties for inverters that increase the warranty period to up to 25 years 

our products are designed to meet the warranty periods and our reliability procedures cover component selection design accelerated life cycle tests and endofmanufacturing line testing however since our history in selling power optimizers and inverters is substantially shorter than the warranty period the calculation of warranty provisions is inherently uncertain 

we accrue for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based on anticipated warranty claims and actual historical warranty claims experience warranty provisions computed on a per‑unit sold basis are based on our best estimate of such costs and are included in our cost of revenues the warranty obligation is determined based on actual and predicted failure rates of the products cost of replacement and service and delivery costs incurred to correct a product failure our warranty obligation requires management to make assumptions regarding estimated failure rates and replacement costs 

in order to predict the failure rate of each of our products we have established a reliability model based on the estimated mean time between failures “mtbf” the mtbf represents the average elapsed time predicted for each product unit between failures during operation applying the mtbf failure rate over our install base for each product type and generation allows us to predict the number of failed units over the warranty period and estimates the costs associated with the product warranty predicted failure rates are updated periodically based on data returned from the field and new product versions as are replacement costs which are updated to reflect changes in our actual production costs for our products subcontractors’ labor costs and actual logistics costs 

since the mtbf model does not take into account additional non‑systematic failures such as failures caused by workmanship or manufacturing or design‑related issues and since warranty claims are at times opened for cases in which the error has been triggered by an improper installation we have developed a supplemental model to predict such cases and recognize the associated expenses ratably over the expected claim period this model which is based on actual root cause analysis of returned products identification of the causes of claims and time until each identified problem is revealed allows us to better predict actual warranty expenses and is updated periodically based on our experience taking into account the installed base of approximately 498 million power optimizers and approximately 21 million inverters as of december 31 2019 

if actual warranty costs differ significantly from these estimates adjustments may be required in the future which could adversely affect our gross profit and results of operations warranty obligations are classified as shortterm and longterm warranty obligations based on the period in which the warranty is expected to be claimed the warranty provision short and longterm was 788 million as of december 31 2017 1218 million as of december 31 2018 and 1726 million as of december 31 2019 

inventory valuation 

our inventories comprise sellable finished goods raw materials bought for own manufacturing or on behalf of our contract manufacturers and faulty units returned under our warranty policy 

sellable finished goods and raw material inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based on the moving average cost method certain factors could affect the realizable value of our inventories including market and economic conditions technological changes existing product changes mainly due to cost reduction activities and new product introductions we consider historic usage expected demand anticipated sales price the effect of new product introductions product obsolescence product merchantability and other factors when evaluating the value of inventories inventory write‑downs are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and their estimated fair market value inventory write‑downs are recorded as cost of revenues in the accompanying statements of operations and were 14 million 09 million and 45 million in the year ended december 31 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively 

faulty products returned under our warranty policy are often refurbished and used as replacement units such products are written off upon receipt 

we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions that we use to record inventory at the lower of cost or market however if estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

business combination 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require our management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired technology and other intangible assets their useful lives and discount rates our management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

intangible and other long lived assets 

we evaluate the recoverability of finitelived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any impairment charges during the year ended december 31 2019 

acquired identifiable finitelived intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis or accelerated method over the estimated useful lives of the assets we believe the basis of amortization approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized over their estimated useful lives we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of finitelived intangible assets in case we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance is amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life 

goodwill 

goodwill reflects the excess of the consideration transferred including the fair value of any contingent consideration and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree over the assigned fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired goodwill is not amortized and is assigned to reporting units and tested for impairment at least on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 

the goodwill impairment test is performed according to the following principles 

1 an initial qualitative assessment may be performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 

2 if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying mount a quantitative fair value test is performed an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value is recognized 

we complete the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for the reporting unit on october 1 of each year and accordingly determines whether goodwill should be impaired as of december 31 2019 no impairment of goodwill has been identified 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 “income taxes” asc 740 which prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc 740 asc 74010 contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that on an evaluation of the technical merits the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 cumulative probability likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates customer concentrations and interest rates we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

approximately 374 412 and 487 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 the year ended december 31 2018 and the year ended december 31 2019 respectively were earned in non‑us dollar denominated currencies principally the euro our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located primarily the us dollar and new israeli shekel and to a lesser extent the euro and korean won our new israeli shekel‑denominated expenses consist primarily of personnel and overhead costs our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 427 million for the year ended december 31 2019 a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the new israeli shekel and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 135 million for the year ended december 31 2019 a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2019 between the korean won and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 12 million for the year ended december 31 2019 

for purposes of our consolidated financial statements local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the us dollar on the balance sheet date and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rate as of the date of the transaction or at the average exchange rate to the us dollar during the reporting period 

to date we have used derivative financial instruments specifically foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign currency risks by hedging a portion of our account receivable balances denominated in euros expected to be paid within six months our foreign currency forward contracts are expected to mitigate exchange rate changes related to the hedged assets we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of 1878 million and 2238 at the end of the year ending december 31 2018 and the year ended december 31 2019 respectively which was held for working capital purposes we had availableforsale marketable securities with an estimated fair value of 1929 million and 2110 million on december 31 2018 and december 31 2019 respectively in addition we had bank deposits of 98 million and 50 million as of december 31 2018 and december 31 2019 respectively we had restricted bank deposits of 16 million and 276 million as of december 31 2018 december 31 2019 respectively 

as of december 31 2019 we had no outstanding forward contracts or put and call options or derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on accounts receivable and forecast cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies we may not be able to purchase derivative instruments adequate to fully insulate ourselves from foreign currency exchange risks and over the past year we have incurred losses as a result of exchange rate fluctuations on exposures that have not been covered by our hedging strategy 

additionally our hedging activities may also contribute to increased losses as a result of volatility in foreign currency markets if foreign exchange currency markets continue to be volatile such fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations in future periods also the volatility in the foreign currency markets may make it difficult to hedge our foreign currency exposures effectively 

concentrations of major customers 

our trade accounts receivables potentially expose us to a concentration of credit risk with our major customers for the year ended december 31 2019 one major customer accounted for 204 of our total revenues and as of december 31 2019 one major customer accounted for approximately 321 of our consolidated trade receivables balance for the year ended december 31 2018 one major customer accounted for 194 of total revenues and as of december 31 2018 two major customers accounted for approximately 413 of our consolidated trade receivables balance we currently do not foresee a credit risk associated with these receivables 

inflation 

we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the last three years if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

commodity price risk 

we are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials including copper which are used in our products prices of these raw materials may be affected by supply restrictions or other market factors from time to time and we do not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate commodity risk significant price changes for these raw materials could reduce our operating margins if we are unable to recover such increases from our customers and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

introduction

 

we have invented an intelligent inverter solution that has changed the way power is harvested and managed in a solar pv system our direct current “dc” optimized inverter system is designed to maximize power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system and providing comprehensive and advanced safety features supporting increased pv proliferation the solaredge system consists of our power optimizers inverters communication and smart energy management solutions and a cloud based monitoring platform solaredges solutions address a broad range of solar market segments from residential solar installations to commercial and small utility‑scale solar installations since we began commercial shipments in 2010 we have shipped approximately 106 gigawatts “gw” of our dc optimized inverter systems and our products have been installed in solar pv systems in 133 countries

 

historically the solar pv industry used traditional string and central inverter architectures to harvest pv solar power however traditional inverter architectures result in energy losses as well as systemic challenges in design flexibility safety and monitoring in recent years microinverter technology was introduced in an attempt to resolve these challenges but this technology has certain inherent limitations we believe that our dc optimized inverter system consisting of an inverter and distributed power optimizers best addresses all of these challenges

 

our system allows for superior power harvesting and module management relative to traditional inverter systems by deploying power optimizers at each pv module while maintaining a competitive system cost by keeping the ac inversion and grid interaction centralized using a simplified dc‑ac inverter the entire system is monitored through our cloud‑based monitoring platform that enables reduced system operation and maintenance “om” costs our system enables each pv module to operate at its own maximum power point “mpp” rather than a system‑wide average enabling dynamic response to real‑world conditions such as atmospheric conditions pv module aging soiling and shading and offering improved energy yield relative to traditional inverter systems in addition to higher efficiency our system’s installed cost per watt is competitive with traditional inverter systems of leading manufacturers and generally lower than comparable microinverter systems of leading manufacturers furthermore our architecture allows for complex rooftop system designs and enhanced safety and reliability our technology and system architecture are protected by 147 awarded patents and 200 patent applications filed worldwide as of december 31 2018 we also have protection for some of our batteryrelated technology through kokam with 143 awarded patents and 9 pending applications

 

we primarily sell our products indirectly to thousands of solar installers through large distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers and directly to large solar installers and engineering procurement and construction firms “epcs” our customers include leading providers of solar pv systems to residential and commercial end users key solar distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers as well as several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules

 

we were founded in 2006 and began commercial shipments in 2010 as of december 31 2018 we have shipped approximately 341 million power optimizers and 14 million inverters more than 920000 installations many of which may include multiple inverters are currently connected to and monitored through our cloud based monitoring platform

 

in july 2018 we closed an asset purchase agreement the gamatronic acquisition” with gamatronic electronics ltd “gamatronic” acquiring the assets of a business for the development manufacturing and sale of uninterruptible power supply systems also known as upss for the aggregate amount of 121 million we purchased substantially all of gamatronic’s assets including its intellectual property brand and tangible assets in october 2018 we also purchased the shares of gamatronic uk limited a uk wholly owned subsidiary of gamatronic responsible for the sale of these ups products in the uk for approximately 10 million net of cash acquired

 

in october 2018 we closed an acquisition the “kokam acquisition” of 745 of kokam co ltd “kokam” a provider of lithiumion cells batteries and energy storage solutions for approximately 825 million usd net of cash acquired since the kokam acquisition and to date we have increased our shareholdings in kokam to approximately 940 headquartered in south korea kokam was founded in 1989 and has been manufacturing lithiumion cells and providing reliable safe highperformance solutions for the past twentynine years kokam provides battery solutions for a widevariety of industries including energy storage systems also known as ess ups electric vehicles ev aerospace and the marine market

limitations of traditional pv system technologies

 

a solar pv system consists of pv modules which produce direct current “dc” power when exposed to sunlight an inverter which transforms the dc power into alternating current “ac” power that is required by the electricity grid and associated cabling fuse boxes and mounting hardware traditionally solar pv systems connected strings of solar pv modules to one or more inverters for this energy conversion

 

traditional inverter architecture still constitutes the vast majority of the pv inverter market especially for larger commercial and utility installations however traditional inverter architecture suffers from significant inefficiencies leading to suboptimal power generation these challenges include

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition to power losses the traditional inverter architecture also has system design installation and operational challenges including

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first generation of module level power electronics “mlpe” was the microinverter this technology scaled down the traditional inverter to a size and power appropriate to a single pv module by creating control and monitoring at the module level microinverters solved certain challenges of the traditional inverter system architecture however microinverter architecture has its own limitations such as

 

 

 

 

 

the solaredge solution

 

our dc optimized inverter system maximizes power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system and providing comprehensive and advanced safety features our solution consists of our power optimizers inverters and cloud‑based monitoring platform and addresses a broad range of solar market segments from residential solar installations to commercial and small utility‑scale solar installations additional features and hardware that can be added to our solution includes a battery pack for storage of energy generated and a home energy automation system which enables greater savings for the system owner

 

the key advantages of our solution include

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our products

 

our basic solution consists of a dc power optimizer an inverter and a cloudbased monitoring platform that operate as a single integrated system

 

solaredge power optimizer   our dc power optimizer is a highly reliable and efficient dc‑to‑dc converter which is connected by installers to each pv module or embedded by pv module manufacturers into their modules as part of the manufacturing process our power optimizer increases energy output from the pv module to which it is connected by continuously tracking the mpp of each module and controlling its working point the power optimizer’s ability to track the mpp of each pv module and its ability to increase or decrease its output voltage enables the inverter’s input voltage to remain fixed under a large variety of string configurations this feature enhances flexibility in pv system designs enabling use of different string lengths in a single pv system connected to the same inverter use of pv panels situated on multiple orientations connected to the same inverter and using varied pv module types in the same string in addition our power optimizers monitor the performance of each pv module and communicates this data to our inverter using our proprietary power line communication in turn the inverter transmits this information to our monitoring server each power optimizer is equipped with our proprietary safety mechanism which automatically reduces the output voltage of each power optimizer to 1v unless the power optimizer receives a fail‑safe signal from a functioning inverter as a result if the inverter is shut down eg for system maintenance due to malfunction in the event of a fire or otherwise the dc voltage throughout the system is reduced to a safe level

 

our power optimizers are designed to withstand high temperatures and harsh environmental conditions and contain multiple bypass features that localize failures and enable continued system operation in the vast majority of cases of power optimizer failure our power optimizers are compatible with the vast majority of modules on the market today and carry a 25‑year product warranty our power optimizers are designed to be used with our inverters as well as third party inverters to provide power optimization monitoring and safety features can also be achieved with third party inverters by adding supplemental communications hardware during fiscal 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 the year ended december 31 2017 and the year ended december 31 2018 revenues derived from the sale of power optimizers represented 500 480 473 and 461 of total revenues respectively

 

solaredge inverter   our dc‑to‑ac inverters contain sophisticated digital control technology with efficient power conversion architecture resulting in superior solar power harvesting and high reliability and are designed to work exclusively with our dc power optimizers a proprietary power line communication receiver is integrated into each inverter receiving data from our power optimizers storing this data and transmitting it to our monitoring server when an internet connection exists since each string which is equipped with our power optimizers provides fixed input voltage to our inverter the inverter is able to operate at its highest efficiency at all times and therefore is more cost‑efficient energy efficient and reliable like our power optimizers our inverters are designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions since the power rating of an inverter determines how many pv modules it can serve larger installations require inverters with higher power ratings we currently offer our second generation of inverters which come in two models a one‑phase inverter designed to address the residential market 1 kilowatt “kw” to 114 kw which includes our hdwave technology and our newly introduced inverterintegrated electric vehicle ev charger and a three‑phase inverter designed to address the residential market in certain european countries and the commercial market 4 kw to 100 kw in june 2017 we introduced an extended commercial solution that consists of various inverters sized 55kw 825kw and 100kw these inverters are designed for commercial installations reduce the number of required inverters and increase the system return on investment the vast majority of our inverters are sold with a 12‑year warranty that is extendable to 20 or 25 years for an additional cost during fiscal 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 the year ended december 31 2017 and the year ended december 31 2018 revenues derived from the sale of inverters represented 457 469 479 and 445 of total revenues respectively

 

ev charging inverter solaredges ev charging inverter offers homeowners the ability to charge electric vehicles up to six times faster than a standard level 1 charger through an innovative solar boost mode that utilizes grid and pv charging simultaneously this inverter is the worlds first ev charger with an integrated pv inverter reducing the hassle of installing separately a standalone ev charger and a pv inverter the ev charging inverter eliminates the need for additional wiring conduit and a breaker installation by installing an ev charger that is integrated with an inverter no additional dedicated circuit breaker is needed saving space and ruling out a potential upgrade to the main distribution panel

 

storedge solutions our storedge solution is a dc coupled solution that is used to increase energy independence and maximize selfconsumption for homeowners by utilizing a battery which is sold separately by third party manufacturers to store and supply power as needed the solution is based on a single inverter for both solar pv and storage our storedge solution is designed to provide smart energy functions such as maximizing selfconsumption timeofuse programming for desired hours of the day and home energy backup solutions to optimize selfconsumption the battery is charged and discharged to meet consumption needs and reduce the amount of power purchased from the grid with a backup solution unused solar pv power is stored in a battery and used during a power outage or when solar pv production is insufficient when there is a power outage a combination of solar pv power and battery is used to power important sources such as the refrigerator communication devices lighting and ac outlets our proprietary monitoring platform provides visibility into battery status solar pv production and selfconsumption while offering easy maintenance with remote access to inverter and battery software existing solaredge systems can be upgraded to our storedge solution

solaredge monitoring software   our cloud‑based monitoring platform collects power voltage current and system data sent from our inverters and power optimizers and allows users to view the data at the module level string level inverter level and system level from any browser or from most smart phones and tablets the monitoring software continuously analyzes data and flags potential problems the monitoring software includes features which are used on a routine basis by integrators installers maintenance staff and system owners to improve a solar pv system’s performance by maximizing solar power harvesting and reducing om costs by increasing system up‑time and detecting pv module performance issues more effectively connection to the monitoring server is completed during installation by the installer the installer then receives full access to system data through the monitoring software and can select the amount of data to be shared with the system owner

 

smart energy management   there are currently two separate energy technology industries that exist today solar energy production and automation technology inverters are taking on an expanded role in energy management and automation and in order   to address these market needs we are developing and providing automation products this line of products when used with the solaredge solution is designed to allow system owners to increase selfconsumption by shifting energy usage to match peak solar pv production as well as offer a convenient wireless control option over various building andor home devices an example of this solution would be using excess solar pv energy to heat water or the ability to remotely turn on or off certain power sources such as lighting or electrical appliances the introduction of these products is dependent upon certification and region specific needs and as such these products are not yet available in all of the geographies in which solaredge operates

 

grid services as pv and storage continue to proliferate around the world energy production is transitioning from a centralized system to a distributed network model where energy is produced close to the location in which it is consumed and stored this model creates an opportunity for new interconnected and decentralized energy networks offering improved grid reliability and stability new energy services and reduction of grid infrastructure costs solaredge grid services deliver near realtime aggregative control and data reporting enabling the pooling of distributed energy resources — photovoltaic systems battery storage electric vehicle chargers and loads — in the cloud for the creation of virtual power plants the solaredge grid services and vpp solution provides sophisticated management platforms to enable realtime aggregated control of available energy resources to meet everchanging supply needs and demand

 

product roadmap

 

our products reflect the innovation focus and capabilities of our technology departments our core product roadmap is divided into five categories power optimizers inverters monitoring services energy storage and smart energy management

 

power optimizers   we currently sell our third generation power optimizer which was designed for fully automated assembly and which is based on our third generation asic a key element of our reliability strategy and a significant differentiator relative to our competitors is our use of proprietary asics to control among other things our power optimizer’s power conversion safety features and pv module monitoring instead of using large numbers of discrete components our power optimizer uses a single proprietary asic thus reducing the total number of components in an electrical circuit and thereby improving reliability in june 2017 we unveiled our fourth generation optimizer which uses fourth generation asic and incorporates a new safety mechanism for pv systems in addition we are also continuing to develop the necessary subsystems for the fifth generation asic which will be used in our fifth generation power optimizer each new asic generation reduces the number of components required and meaningfully improved the efficiency of the power optimizer the efficiency improvement reduces the energy losses which in turn reduces the amount of heat dissipation this enables design of a more costeffective and usually smaller enclosure and also keeps the electronics cooler thereby improving the power optimizer’s reliability

 

inverters   our inverter roadmap is intended to serve three purposes i expand addressable market by developing new and larger inverters designed specifically for larger commercial installations and utility‑scale projects ii improve the electronics to increase the total power throughput without changing the existing enclosure thereby reducing the actual cost per watt and increasing economies of scale and iii improve ease of installation by integrating additional functionality required in certain installations in order to reduce costs of additional hardware and subcontractors’ labor costs as part of our inverter roadmap we plan to apply our hdwave technology to threephase inverters and we are in the development process for doing so

 

monitoring services   our cloud‑based monitoring platform is continuously growing by the amount of data aggregated we are continuously developing tools to accommodate our growth and further enhance our service offering specifically we plan to increase data compression in order to enable support for a rapidly increasing number of field systems while using low‑cost equipment in addition we plan to improve our reporting systems and enable users to obtain self‑generated customized reports we also expect to expand algorithms that detect and pinpoint problems that can affect power production in field systems we further plan to add more capabilities through our public application program interface to allow users to build and integrate our system into their own systems and to allow users to build and share useful applications based on monitoring data gathered by our software

 

electric vehicle charging in 2018 we further expanded our business by offering our ev charging solutions the first offered product in this respect is a residential solar inverter that integrates an ev charger this product addresses the growing market for evs and the need for a higher power charging solution while maintaining control over electricity costs and maximizing selfconsumption

our technology

 

we have drawn on our expertise in the fields of power electronics magnetic design mechanical and heat dissipation capabilities control loops and algorithms and power line communications to design and develop what we believe to be the most advanced commercial solutions for harvesting power from solar pv systems our advanced technologies are explained in more detail below

 

power optimizers

 

our power optimizers are dcdc step upstep down buck‑boost converters designed and developed to operate in harsh outdoor environments at very high conversion efficiency our power optimizers include proprietary power electronics customized to efficiently convert power from the pv module to the inverter the conversion topology and components are all designed for the power optimizer specifications and verified for consistent performance and reliability in numerous lab tests and simulations

 

a key factor in the performance of our power optimizer is determined by the digital control algorithms and closed‑loop mechanism the power optimizer’s control is built into our advanced asic which is responsible for all critical digital control functions of the power optimizer including detailed power analysis digital control of the power conversion subsystem and power line communications and networking since each power optimizer handles the power and voltage of a single module we are able to reach a high degree of semiconductor integration by leveraging low cost silicon in standard semiconductor packages as a result much of the functionality of our power optimizer can be integrated into a standard asic instead of discrete electronic components resulting in lower costs and higher reliability

 

the asic performs the critical power analysis and power conversion control functions of the power optimizer the power analysis function processes the status and working parameters at the power optimizer’s input and output and together with advanced digital control and state machine logic controls the power conversion function in addition our digital control system uses technology that allows the solar pv installation to anticipate and adapt to changing operating conditions and protect against system anomalies

 

each power optimizer in the array is connected to the inverter by a power line communications networking link our power line communications link uses a proprietary networking technology that we developed utilizing the existing dc wiring between the power optimizers and the inverter to transmit and receive data between these devices

 

inverters

 

our inverter is designed for single‑stage dcac conversion using our inverter in combination with the power optimizers will allow the control loop to maintain a fixed dc voltage level at its input thereby allowing for longer uneven and multi‑faceted strings while also enabling custom cost–efficient and reliable inverter design and component selection all of the power components as well as the main magnetic components for our inverters can then be optimized for dcac inversion at high efficiency

 

the digital control algorithms of our inverters are implemented using programmable digital signal processors which allow for flexibility and adaptation of control loops for various grids and for the requirements and standards of various grid operators across geographies we have already implemented the control mechanisms necessary to support advanced grid codes and standards that are required to support high penetration of solar energy into the grid

 

manufacturing

 

we have designed our manufacturing processes to produce high quality products at competitive costs the strategy is threefold outsource automate and localize we currently contract to have our solar products manufactured by three of the world’s leading global electronics manufacturing service providers jabil circuit inc celestica llc and flextronics industrial ltd while the contract with celestica will terminate as of may 1 2019 by using contract manufacturers rather than building our own manufacturing infrastructure we are able to access advanced manufacturing equipment processes skills and capacity on a “capital light” budget our contract manufacturers are responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products except with regard to endofline testing equipment and other specific manufacturing equipment utilized in assembling our products or subcomponents which are financed and owned by the company we expect to continue this funding arrangement in the future with respect to any expansions to such existing lines further contracting with global providers such as jabil celestica and flextronics gives us added flexibility to manufacture certain products in china closer to target markets in asia and the north american west coast as well as other products in romania and hungary closer to target markets in europe and the north american east coast potentially increasing responsiveness to customers while reducing costs and delivery times in july 2017 we executed a long term lease agreement for 10000 square meters in israel intended for the establishment of a manufacturing facility for the production of product prototypes manufacturing and the development of proprietary manufacturing and testing equipment the facility is still under development

 

we have developed propriety automated assembly lines for the manufacturing of our power optimizers these assembly lines currently operating in all of our manufacturing facilities enable the manufacturing of more than 4000 optimizers per machine per day we invest resources in additional automated assembly lines as well as in automated machinery for subassembly and selfmanufacturing of certain components used in our products and we own and are responsible for funding all of the capital expenses related thereto the current and expected capital expenses associated with these automated assembly lines and other machinery are not significant and will be funded out of our cash flows in addition we are in the process of designing an automatic assembly line for the production of embedded optimizers

 

we source our raw materials through various component manufacturers and invest resources in continued costreduction efforts as well as verifying second and third sources so as to limit dependence on sole suppliers

 

reliability and quality control

 

our power optimizers are either connected to each pv module by installers or embedded in each pv module by pv module manufacturers our power optimizers are designed to be as reliable as the pv module itself and capable of withstanding the same operating and environmental conditions

 

our reliability methodology includes a multi‑level plan with design analysis sub‑system testing of critical components by accelerated life testing and integrative testing of design prototypes by highly accelerated life testing and large sample groups as part of our reliability efforts we subject components to industry standard conditions and tests including in accelerated life chambers that simulate burn‑in thermal cycling damp‑heat and other stresses we also conduct out of box audits oba on our finished products online reliability tests ort are conducted on our inverters and we test complete products in stress tests and in the field our rigorous testing processes have helped us to develop highly reliable products

 

in order to verify the quality of each of our products when it leaves the manufacturing plant each component sub‑assembly and final product are tested multiple times during production these tests include automatic optical inspection in‑circuit testing board‑ functional testing safety testing and integrative stress testing we employ a serial number‑driven manufacturing process auditing and traceability system that allows us to control production line activities verify correct manufacturing processes and to achieve item‑specific traceability

 

as a part of our quality and reliability approach failed products from the field are returned and subjected to root cause analysis the results of which are used to improve our product and manufacturing processes and design and further reduce our field failure rate

 

certifications

 

our products and systems comply with the applicable regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are sold as well as all other major markets around the world these include safety regulations electromagnetic compatibility standards and grid compliance

 

research and development

 

we devote substantial resources to research and development with the objective of developing new products and systems adding new features to existing products and systems and reducing unit costs of our products and systems our development strategy is to identify features products and systems for both software and hardware that reduce the cost and improve the effectiveness of our solutions for our customers we measure the effectiveness of our research and development by metrics including product unit cost efficiency reliability power output and ease of use

 

we have a strong research and development team with wide‑ranging experience in power electronics semiconductors power line communications and networking and software engineering in addition many members of our team have expertise in solar technologies as of december 31 2018 our research and development organization had a headcount of 598 employees including kokam

 

intellectual property

 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies information processes and know‑how we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws in the us and similar laws in other countries confidentiality agreements and procedures and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology as of december 31 2018 solaredge had 102 issued us patents 45 issued non‑us patents 85 patent applications pending for examination in the us and 114 patent applications pending for examination in other countries all of which are related to us applications a majority of our patents relate to dc power optimization and dc to ac conversion for alternative energy power systems power system monitoring and control and management systems our issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2024 and 2035 as of december 31 2018 kokam had 14 issued us patents 60 issued patents in korea and additional 92 issued patents in other countries additionally as of december 31 2018 kokam had 15 patent applications pending for examination worldwide

 

we continually assess opportunities to seek patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages

 

we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests with respect to proprietary know‑how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we believe that many elements of our manufacturing processes involve proprietary know‑how technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes test equipment designs algorithms and procedures

 

all of our research and development personnel are required to enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us

 

our customers and business partners are required to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans

 

competition

 

the markets for our solar products are competitive and we compete with manufacturers of traditional inverters and manufacturers of other mlpe the principal areas in which we compete with other companies include

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our dc optimized inverter system competes principally with products from traditional inverter manufacturers such as sma solar technology ag abb ltd and huawei technologies co ltd as well as from other chinese inverter manufacturers in the north american residential market we compete with traditional inverter manufacturers as well as microinverter manufacturers such as enphase energy inc in addition several new entrants to the mlpe market including low‑cost asian manufacturers have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped similar products we believe that our dc optimized inverter system offers significant technology and cost advantages that reflect a competitive differentiation over traditional inverter systems and microinverter technologies

 

the markets for our lithiumion products are competitive as well and we compete with global cell and battery manufacturers in the ess market our energy storage solutions compete with products from global manufactures such as lg chem samsung sdi byd and panasonic

 

in the ups market our ups products compete with products and solutions from global ups providers such as schneider electric eaton and emerson

 

government incentives

 

us federal state and local government bodies as well as nonus government bodies provide incentives to owners end users distributors and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar pv systems from property tax assessments the market for on‑grid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of these government subsidies and economic incentives which vary by geographic market and from time to time in general the amount and availability of these incentives and subsidies to encourage the development of solar pv energy have been declining and are expected to continue to decline

 

import tariffs

 

the us government has proposed new or higher tariffs on specified imported products originating from china in response to what it characterizes as unfair trade practices and china has responded by proposing new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from the united states in january 2018 a tariff on imported solar modules and cells was adopted in the united states the tariff which does not apply directly to our products except possibly with respect to power optimizers that are embedded onto solar panels in china was initially set at 30 with a gradual reduction over four years to 15 in addition in july 2018 a 10 tariff on a long list of products imported from china including inverters and power optimizers was adopted in the united states under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 and became effective on september 24 2018

 

an additional increase of the tariffs to 25 was expected to take effect on january 1 2019 however following a meeting held between us president trump and chinese president xi jinping on december 1 2018 president trump indicated that he would postpone increasing the tariff rate to 25 on certain chinese goods the parties agreed to endeavor on a 90day period until march 1 2019 to discuss the restructuring of china’s trade policies and come to an agreement on february 24 2019 us president trump has announced that considering progress in trade talks with china the united states is planning to delay the additional tariffs that were scheduled to begin on march 1 2019

 

it is uncertain what effect if any these tariffs may have on the price of solar systems in the united states if the price of solar systems in the us increases it would likely reduce the number of solar systems manufactured and sold which in turn may decrease demand for our products

 

seasonality

 

the solar energy market is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations affected by weather for example during the winter months in europe and the northeastern us where the climate is particularly cold and snowy it is typical to see a decline in pv installations and this decline can impact the timing of orders for our products

 

employees

 

as of december 31 2018 we had 1737 full‑time employees of these full‑time employees 598   were engaged in research and development 323 in sales and marketing 663 in operations production and support and 153 in general and administrative capacities of our employees 924 were based in israel 266 were based in korea 183 were based in the us 103 were based in china 55 were based in germany and an additional 206 were based elsewhere

 

none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced any employmentrelated work stoppages and we consider relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors

 

risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in particular forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties some of which cannot be predicted or quantified see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements”

 

risks related to our business and our industry

 

we cannot be certain that we will sustain our current level of profitability in the future

 

we achieved a net profit of 766 million 254 million 842 million and 1280 million in fiscal 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 the year ended december 31 2017 and the year ended december 31 2018 respectively our revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons many of which are outside our control including a decline in demand for our products increased competition a decrease in the growth of the solar industry or our market share or our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities if we fail to maintain sufficient revenue to support our operations we may not be able to sustain profitability

 

in addition we expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business including in connection with recent or future acquisitions as well as ongoing marketing and developing our products development of our own manufacturing facilities expanding into new product markets and geographies maintaining and enhancing our research and development operations and hiring additional personnel we do not know whether our revenues will grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs or the extent of these expenses or their impact on our results of operations

 

the rapidly evolving and competitive nature of the solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects our entry into other adjacent markets through recent acquisitions is new and highly competitive and it is difficult to evaluate our future in these new markets as well

 

much of our growth has occurred in recent periods the rapidly evolving and competitive nature of the solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects in addition we have limited insight into emerging trends that may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects our recent acquisitions in adjacent markets such as upss and ess are new to us and these are highly competitive markets in which we will need to compete we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries including unpredictable and volatile revenues and increased expenses as we continue to grow our business

 

the viability and demand for solar energy solutions ups solutions and ess products and in turn our products may be affected by many factors outside of our control including

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we do not manage these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully our business and results of operations will suffer

 

if demand for solar energy solutions does not continue to grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our business and results of operations will suffer

 

our solution is utilized in solar pv installations as a result our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years and we cannot be certain that consumers and businesses with respect to distributed solar solutions or utilities with respect to utilityscale solar projects will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to grow our business if demand for solar energy solutions fails to develop sufficiently demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business

 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business  

federal state local and foreign government bodies provide incentives to owners end users distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments payments of renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar pv systems from property tax assessments the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market because our customers’ sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business for example in august 2015 the united kingdom’s department of energy and climate change decc launched a consultation on the future of the feedin tariffs fits scheme the consultation reduced the levels of fit effective february 2016 under the new fit scheme uk solar installations have significantly dropped these subsidies and incentives may expire on a particular date end when the allocated funding is exhausted or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase or as a result of legal challenges the adoption of new statutes or regulations or the passage of time these reductions or terminations often occur without warning

 

in addition several jurisdictions have adopted renewable portfolio standards which mandate that a certain portion of electricity delivered by utilities to customers come from a set of eligible renewable energy resources by a certain compliance date some programs further specify that a portion of the renewable energy quota must be from solar electricity under some programs a utility can receive a “credit” for renewable energy produced by a third party by either purchasing the electricity directly from the producer or paying a fee to obtain the right to renewable energy generated but used by the generator or sold to another party a renewable energy credit allows the utility to add this electricity to its renewable portfolio requirement total without actually expending the capital for generating facilities however there can be no assurances that such policies will continue for example in december 2015 nevadas public utilities commission increased the fixed service charge for netmetered solar customers and lowered compensation for net excess solar generation proposals to extend compliance deadlines reduce targets or repeal standards have also been introduced in a number of states reduction or elimination of renewable portfolio standards or successful efforts to meet current standards could harm or halt the growth of the solar pv industry and our business

 

changes in the us trade environment including the recent imposition of import tariffs could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenues results of operations or cash flows

 

the us government recently proposed new or higher tariffs on specified imported products originating from china in response to what it characterizes as unfair trade practices and china has responded by proposing new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from the united states in january 2018 a tariff on imported solar modules and cells was adopted in the united states the tariff which tariff does not apply directly to our products except possibly with respect to power optimizers that are embedded onto solar panels in china was initially set at 30 with a gradual reduction over four years to 15 in addition in july 2018 a 10 tariff on a long list of products imported from china including inverters and power optimizers was adopted in the united states under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 and became effective on september 24 2018

 

an additional increase of the tariffs to 25 was expected to take effect on january 1 2019 however following a meeting held between on december 1 2018 us president trump and chinese president xi jinping on december 1 2018 met to discuss trade relations between the two countries following their meeting president trump indicated that he would postpone increasing the tariff rate to 25 on certain chinese goods currently covered under section 301 list 3 as notified by the us administration the parties agreed to endeavor on a 90day period until march 1 2019 to discuss the restructuring of china’s trade policies and come to an agreement on february 24 2019 us president trump has announced that considering progress in trade talks with china the united states is planning to delay the additional tariffs that were scheduled to begin on march 1 2019 

 

these tariffs and the possibility of additional tariffs in the future have created uncertainty in the industry concerning whether they will cause a material increase in the price of solar systems in the united states if the price of solar systems in the united states increases the use of solar systems could become less economically feasible and could reduce our gross margins or reduce the demand of solar systems manufactured and sold which in turn may decrease demand for our products additionally existing or future tariffs may negatively affect key customers suppliers and manufacturing partners such outcomes could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenues results of operations or cash flows and continuing uncertainty could cause sales volatility price fluctuations or supply shortages or cause our customers to advance or delay their purchase of our products

 

changes to net metering policies may significantly reduce demand for electricity from solar pv systems and harm our business

 

our business benefits from favorable net metering policies in several us states canadian provinces and european countries in which our customers operate net metering allows a solar pv system owner to pay his or her local electric utility only for power usage net of production from the solar pv system transforming the conventional relationship between customers and traditional utilities system owners receive credit for the energy that the solar installation generates to offset energy usage at times when the solar installation is not generating energy under a net metering program the customer typically pays for the net energy used or receives a credit against future bills at the retail rate if more energy is produced than consumed in some locations customers are also reimbursed by the electric utility for net excess generation on a periodic basis

 

most us states have adopted some form of net metering however net metering programs have recently come under regulatory scrutiny in some us states due to challenges alleging that net metering policies inequitably shift costs onto nonsolar ratepayers by allowing solar ratepayers to sell electricity at rates that are too high for utilities to recoup their fixed costs we cannot assure you that the programs will not be significantly modified going forward

 

if the value of the credit that customers receive for net metering is significantly reduced endusers may be unable to recognize the same level of cost savings associated with net metering that current endusers enjoy the absence of favorable net metering policies or of net metering entirely or the imposition of new charges that only or disproportionately affect endusers that use net metering would significantly limit demand for solar pv systems that are sold by our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future growth

 

existing electric utility industry regulations and changes to regulations may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar pv systems that may significantly reduce demand for our products or harm our ability to compete

 

federal state local and foreign government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry and internal policies and regulations promulgated by electric utilities heavily influence the market for electricity generation products and services these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and the interconnection of customerowned electricity generation and governments and utilities continuously modify these regulations and policies these regulations and policies could deter purchases of renewable energy products including solar pv systems sold by our customers this could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for our products for example utilities commonly charge fees to larger industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for backup purposes these fees could increase the cost to use solar pv systems sold by our customers and make them less desirable thereby harming our business prospects financial condition and results of operations in addition depending on the region electricity generated by solar pv systems competes most effectively with expensive peakhour electricity from the electric grid rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the utilities’ peak hour pricing policies or rate design such as to a flat rate could require the price of solar pv systems and their component parts to be lower in order to compete with the price of electricity from the electric grid

 

changes in current laws or regulations applicable to us or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the us europe or other jurisdictions in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations any changes to government or internal utility regulations and policies that favor electric utilities could reduce the competitiveness of solar pv systems sold by our customers and cause a significant reduction in demand for our products and services for example regulators in certain us states have been asked to consider proposals to assess fees on consumers purchasing energy from solar pv systems or imposing a new charge that would disproportionately impact solar pv system owners who utilize net metering either of which would increase the cost of solar pv energy to those consumers and could reduce demand for our products any similar government or utility policies adopted in the future that discourage the growth of solar pv systems could reduce demand for our products and services and adversely impact our growth in addition changes in our products or changes in export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects

 

decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid would make the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and would likely lower sales of our products the price of electricity derived from the utility grid could decrease as a result of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moreover technological developments in the solar components industry could allow our competitors and their customers to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be achieved by us and our customers which could result in reduced demand for our products

 

if the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations incorporating our systems is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed

 

an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a solar pv system and could reduce the demand for solar systems and thus demand for our products

 

many endusers depend on financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build or purchase a solar pv system as a result an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or their customers the endusers to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a solar pv system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our products which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of endusers install solar pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through financing an increase in interest rates could lower such enduser’s return on investment on a solar pv system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar pv systems and in each case could cause such endusers to seek alternative investments

 

the market for our products is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce power optimizer inverter and solar pv system monitoring products which could negatively affect our results of operations and market share

 

the market for solar pv solutions is highly competitive we principally compete with traditional inverter manufacturers as well as microinverter manufacturers currently our dc optimized inverter system competes with products from traditional inverter manufacturers and microinverter manufacturers as well as emerging technology companies offering alternative mlpe products several new entrants to the inverter and mlpe market including lowcost asian manufacturers have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped products in markets in which we sell our products including most recently with respect to sales in australia and in europe we expect competition to intensify as new and existing competitors enter the market

 

several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger have greater financial marketing distribution customer support and other resources are longer established and have better brand recognition further certain competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than us may partner with other competitors to provide combined technologies and competing solutions and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours in addition some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices for our products in order to compete effectively if we have to reduce our prices by more than we anticipated or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer

 

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may have a material adverse effect on demand for our offerings

 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advances in other forms of distributed solar pv power generation storage solutions such as batteries the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could result in product obsolescence the loss of competitiveness of our products decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors

 

our industry has historically been cyclical and experienced periodic downturns

 

our future success partly depends on continued demand for solar pv systems in the endmarkets we serve including the residential and commercial sectors in the united states and europe the solar industry has historically been cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns which may affect the demand for equipment that we manufacture the solar industry has undergone challenging business conditions in recent years including downward pricing pressure for pv modules mainly as a result of overproduction and reductions in applicable governmental subsidies contributing to demand decreases although the solar industry is experiencing a slow recovery there is no assurance that the solar industry will not suffer significant downturns in the future which will adversely affect demand for our solar products and our results of operations

 

defects or performance problems in our products could result in loss of customers reputational damage and decreased revenue and we may face warranty indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products

 

although our products meet our stringent quality requirements they may contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new generations are released errors defects or poor performance can arise due to design flaws defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties which can affect both the quality and the yield of the product any actual or perceived errors defects or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products shipment delays rejection of our products damage to our reputation lost revenue diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and increases in customer service and support costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

furthermore defective components may give rise to warranty indemnity or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive from the affected products we offer a minimum 12year limited warranty for our inverters and a 25year limited warranty for our power optimizers our limited warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship of our products under normal use and service conditions as a result we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold products and recognized revenue while we do have accrued reserves for warranty claims our estimated warranty costs for previously sold products may change to the extent future products are not compatible with earlier generation products under warranty our warranty accruals are based on our assumptions and we do not have a long history of making such assumptions as a result these assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our systems causing us to incur substantial unanticipated expense to repair or replace defective products in the future or to compensate customers for defective products our failure to accurately predict future claims could result in unexpected volatility in and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

 

if one of our products were to cause injury to someone or cause property damage including as a result of product malfunctions defects or improper installation then we could be exposed to product liability claims we could incur significant costs and liabilities if we are sued and if damages are awarded against us further any product liability claim we face could be expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention the successful assertion of a product liability claim against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages penalties or fines subject us to adverse publicity damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely affect sales of our products in addition product liability claims injuries defects or other problems experienced by other companies in the residential solar industry could lead to unfavorable market conditions for the industry as a whole and may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract new customers thus harming our growth and financial performance

 

if we do not forecast demand for our products accurately we may experience product shortages delays in product shipment excess product inventory or difficulties in planning expenses which will adversely affect our business and financial condition

 

our products are manufactured according to our estimates of customer demand which requires us to make multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to demand from solar pv installers and distributors their end customers and general market conditions because we sell a large portion of our products to larger solar installers and various distributors who in turn sell to local installers who in turn sell to their end customers the system owner we have limited visibility as to end customer demand and it is difficult to forecast future enduser demand to plan our operations if we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are cancelled or shipments are delayed we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell conversely if we underestimate demand we may not have sufficient inventory to meet end customer demand or to ramp up production at our contract manufacturers in a timely manner or we could incur additional costs lose market share damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forego potential revenue opportunities for example in late2017 and early 2018 we had high customer demand and certain component shortages which forced us to shorten transportation time from our factories in china by using air freight rather than less expensive ocean freight

 

we are dependent on ocean transportation to deliver our products in a cost efficient manner if we are unable to use ocean transportation to deliver our products our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted

 

we rely on commercial ocean transportation for the delivery of a large percentage of our products to our customers we also rely on more expensive air transportation when ocean transportation is not available or compatible with the delivery time requirements of our customers or when we are unable to meet the growing volume demands of our customers and need to accelerate delivery times our ability to deliver our products via ocean transportation could be adversely impacted by shortages in available cargo capacity changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling pricing payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel taxes and labor and other factors such as labor strikes and work stoppages not within our control if we are unable to use ocean transportation and are required to substitute more expensive air transportation our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted

 

we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers

 

we do not yet have internal manufacturing capabilities and currently rely upon our contract manufacturers to build all of our products one of our contract manufacturers is in the process of ramping up manufacturing during this period we mainly rely on one contract manufacturer any change in our relationship with our contract manufacturers or changes to contractual terms of our agreements with the contract manufacturers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs

 

the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues as a result fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner in addition the facilities in which our products are manufactured are located outside of the us currently in china romania and hungary the location of these facilities outside of key markets such as the us increases shipping time thereby causing a long lead time between manufacturing and delivery

 

if any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers an alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms including price any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers or increase our shipping costs to make up for delays in manufacturing which in turn could reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers and damage our reputation with local installers and potential endusers and cause us to forego potential revenue opportunities

 

we may experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations

 

our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise such processes involve a number of precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched identified and properly addressed and rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques andor expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased warranty reserve increased production and logistical costs and delays any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for key components and raw materials in our products to adequately meet anticipated demand due to the limited number of such suppliers any cessation of operations or production or any shortage delay price change imposition of tariffs or duties or other limitation on our ability to obtain the components and raw materials we use could result in sales delays higher costs associated with air shipments cancellations and loss of market share

 

we depend on limited or single source suppliers for certain key components and raw materials used to manufacture our products making us susceptible to quality issues shortages and price changes any of these limited or single source suppliers could stop producing our components or supplying our raw materials cease operations or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with one or more of our competitors as a result these suppliers could stop selling to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all because there are a limited number of suppliers of solar pv system components and raw materials used to manufacture our products it may be difficult to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative components or raw materials on commercially reasonable terms and our ability to satisfy customer demand may be adversely affected transitioning to a new supplier or redesigning a product to accommodate a new component manufacturer would result in additional costs and delays these outcomes could harm our business or financial performance

 

managing our supplier and contractor relationships is particularly difficult when we are introducing new products and when demand for our products is increasing especially if demand increases more quickly than we expect

any interruption in the supply of limited source components or raw materials for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers could result in lost revenue or higher expenses associated with increased air shipments required to meet customer demand in a timely manner and would harm our business

for example during 2017 and 2018 our industry suffered from a severe component shortages which affected our ability to timely receive components within lead time and caused an extension of certain lead times by our suppliers this shortages resulted in a delay in cost reduction activities which negatively impacted our gross margin as well as necessitated expedited air shipments that had an impact on our operating margins

 

failure by our contract manufacturers or our component or raw material suppliers to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations may adversely affect our business

 

we do not control our contract manufacturers or suppliers or their business practices accordingly we cannot guarantee that they follow ethical business practices such as fair wage practices and compliance with environmental safety and other local laws a lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative manufacturers or suppliers which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products product shortages or other disruptions of our operations violation of labor or other laws by our manufacturers or suppliers or the divergence of a supplier’s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the us or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and harm our business

 

our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter which could make our future performance difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations for a particular period to fall below expectations resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock

 

our quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the future we have experienced seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in the past as a result of seasonal fluctuations in our customers’ business for example our customers’ and endusers’ ability to install solar energy systems is affected by weather as for example during the winter months in europe and the northeastern us such installation delays can impact the timing of orders for our products further given that we are operating in an industry that is affected by fluctuations as a result of economic factors such as tariff changes the true extent of these fluctuations may have been masked by our recent growth rates and consequently may not be readily apparent from our historical results of operations and may be difficult to predict our financial performance sales working capital requirements and cash flow may fluctuate and our past quarterly results of operations may not be good indicators of future performance any substantial decrease in revenues would have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price

 

we rely on distributors and large installers to assist in selling our products and the failure of these customers to perform as expected could reduce our future revenue

 

we currently sell a substantial percentage of our products through distributors who in turn sell to local installers and through direct sales to large installers we do not have exclusive arrangements with these third party distributors and large installers many of our distributors also market and sell products from our competitors and all of our large installer customers also use products from our competitors these distributors and large installers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and with little or no notice further these distributors and large installers may fail to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors termination of agreements with current distributors or large installers failure by these distributors or large installers to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new distributor or large installer relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and results of operations

 

the loss of one or more members of our senior management team or other key personnel or our failure to attract additional qualified personnel may adversely affect our business and our ability to achieve our anticipated level of growth

 

we depend on the continued services of our senior management team including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and other key personnel each of whom would be difficult to replace the loss of any such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to implement our business strategy all of our employees including our senior management are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time we do not maintain keyperson insurance for any of our employees including senior management

 

additionally our ability to attract qualified personnel including senior management and key technical personnel is critical to the execution of our growth strategy competition for qualified senior management personnel and highly skilled individuals with technical expertise is extremely intense and we face challenges identifying hiring and retaining qualified personnel in all areas of our business in addition integrating new employees into our team could prove disruptive to our operations require substantial resources and management attention and ultimately prove unsuccessful our failure to attract and retain qualified senior management and other key technical personnel could limit or delay our strategic efforts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects

 

if we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our business and results of operations could be materially harmed

 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and unfair competition laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we have applied for patents in the us europe and china some of which have been issued we cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology and any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to among other things rebrand or redesign our affected products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the us we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated infringed or otherwise violated

 

in addition we have filed a lawsuit against huawei technologies co ltd a chinese entity huawei technologies düsseldorf gmbh a german entity and wattkraft solar gmbh a german distributor for huawei in the regional court of mannheim in germany asserting unauthorized use of our patented technology the lawsuit is intended to protect our significant investment in our intellectual property but it also may consume management and financial resources for long periods of time and as meritorious as we believe it to be may not result in favorable outcome for us

 

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert management’s attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate

 

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry from time to time we may also be subject to claims of intellectual property right infringement and related litigation and if we gain greater recognition in the market we face a higher risk of being the subject of claims that we have violated others’ intellectual property rights for example in september 2018 our german subsidiary solaredge technologies gmbh received a complaint filed by sma solar technology ag the complaint filed in the district court düsseldorf germany alleges that solaredges 125kw  276kw inverters infringe two of plaintiff’s patents although we are certain that we have meritorious defenses to the claims responding to such claims can be time consuming can divert management’s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses in litigation or settlement while we believe that our products and technology do not infringe in any material respect upon any valid intellectual property rights of third parties we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims if we do not successfully defend or settle an intellectual property claim we could be liable for significant monetary damages and could be prohibited from continuing to use certain technology business methods content or brands to avoid a prohibition we could seek a license from the applicable third party which could require us to pay significant royalties increasing our operating expenses if a license is not available at all or not available on reasonable terms we may be required to develop or license a nonviolating alternative either of which could require significant effort and expense if we cannot license or develop a nonviolating alternative we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our offerings and may be unable to effectively compete any of these results would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees which could result in litigation and adversely affect our business

 

we enter into agreements with our employees pursuant to which they agree that any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement are assigned to us or owned exclusively by us depending on the jurisdiction without the employee retaining any rights a significant portion of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees in the course of their employment for us under the israeli patent law 57271967 the “patent law” inventions conceived by an employee during the scope of his or her employment with a company are regarded as “service inventions” which belong to the employer absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer giving the employee service invention rights the patent law also provides that if there is no such agreement between an employer and an employee the israeli compensation and royalties committee the “committee” a body constituted under the patent law shall determine whether the employee is entitled to remuneration for his or her inventions recent decisions by the committee and the israeli supreme court have created uncertainty in this area as the israeli supreme court held that employees may be entitled to remuneration for their service inventions despite having specifically waived any such rights further the committee has not yet determined the method for calculating this committeeenforced remuneration although our employees have agreed that any rights related to their inventions are owned exclusively by us we may face claims demanding remuneration in consideration for such acknowledgement as a consequence of such claims we could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to our current andor former employees or be forced to litigate such claims which could negatively affect our business

 

the loss of or events affecting one of our major customers could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

for the year ended december 31 2018 three of our major customers accounted for 334  of our revenues our next five largest customers for the year ended december 31 2018 together accounted for 212 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2018 our largest customer was consolidated electrical distributors inc ced accounting for 194 of our revenues our customers’ decisions to purchase our products are influenced by a number of factors outside of our control including retail energy prices and government regulation and incentives among others in addition these customers may decide to no longer use our products and services for other reasons which may be out of our control although we have agreements with some of our largest customers these agreements do not have longterm purchase commitments and are generally terminable by either party after a relatively short notice period the loss of or events affecting one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example in april 2017 one of our customers sungevity filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy laws

consolidations in the solar industry among our current or potential customers or distributors may adversely affect our competitive position    

there has been an increase in consolidation activity among distributors large installers and other strategic partners in the solar industry for example in june 2016 tesla motors tsla announced that it had submitted a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of solarcity corporation scty in june 2018 enphase energy enph announced its acquisition of sunpower’s spwr mincroinverter business this trend could further increase our reliance on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales and may negatively impact our competitive position in the solar market

our planned expansion into new geographic markets or new product lines or services could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks

 

in the year ended december 31 2018 we sold our products in different countries including the us canada belgium france germany israel italy the netherlands the united kingdom australia japan korea taiwan sweden and china we have in the past and may in the future evaluate opportunities to expand into new geographic markets and introduce new product offerings and services that are a natural extension of our existing business we also may from time to time engage in acquisitions of businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our market position enable us to enter attractive markets expand our technological capabilities or provide synergy opportunities for example we intend to continue introduce new products targeted at large commercial and utilityscale installations and to continue to expand into other international markets

our success operating in these new geographic or product markets or in operating any acquired business will depend on a number of factors including our ability to develop solutions to address the requirements of the large commercial and utilityscale solar pv markets timely qualification and certification of new products for large commercial and utilityscale solar pv installations acceptance of power optimizers in solar pv markets in which they have not traditionally been used our ability to manage increased manufacturing capacity and production and our ability to identify and integrate any acquired businesses

 

further we expect these new solar pv markets to have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products and our success will depend on our ability to adapt properly to these differences these differences may include differing regulatory requirements including tax laws trade laws labor regulations tariffs export quotas customs duties or other trade restrictions limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection international political or economic conditions restrictions on the repatriation of earnings longer sales cycles warranty expectations product return policies and cost performance and compatibility requirements in addition expanding into new geographic markets will increase our exposure to presently existing risks such as fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and difficulties and increased expenses in complying with us and foreign laws regulations and trade standards including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa”

 

failure to develop and introduce these new products successfully or to otherwise manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to sustain profitability

 

if we fail to manage our recent and future growth effectively we may be unable to execute our business plan maintain high levels of customer service or adequately address competitive challenges

 

we have experienced significant growth in recent periods with our annual product sales growing rapidly from approximately 8400 inverters and approximately 181000 power optimizers in the fiscal year ending june 30 2011 our first full fiscal year of commercial shipments to annual product sales exceeding 456000 inverters and 114 million power optimizers in the year ended december 31 2018 we intend to continue to expand our business significantly within existing and new markets this growth has placed and any future growth may place a significant strain on our management operational and financial infrastructure in particular we will be required to expand train and manage our growing employee base and scale and otherwise improve our it infrastructure in tandem with that headcount growth our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers as well as manage multiple geographic locations

 

our current and planned operations personnel it information systems and other systems and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth and may require us to make additional unanticipated investment in our infrastructure our success and ability to further scale our business will depend in part on our ability to manage these changes in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot manage our growth we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures this could also result in declines in quality or customer satisfaction increased costs difficulties in introducing new offerings or other operational difficulties any failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our business and reputation

 

  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

 

although our financial results are reported in us dollars 412 of our revenues in the year ended december 31 2018 were generated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition a significant portion of our operating expenses are accrued in new israeli shekels primarily related to payroll and to a lesser extent the euro and other currencies our profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and to a lesser extent the new israeli shekel and other currencies in which we generate revenues incur expenses and maintain cash balances foreign currency fluctuations may also affect the prices of our products our prices are denominated primarily in us dollars if there is a significant devaluation of a particular currency the prices of our products will increase relative to the local currency and may be less competitive despite our efforts to minimize foreign currency risks primarily by entering into forwardhedging transactions to sell euro for us dollars at a predefined rate and maintaining cash balances in new israeli shekels significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values in particular a significant change in the relative values of the euro and to a lesser extent the new israeli shekel and other currencies against the us dollar could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition

 

from time to time we may enter into forward contracts to hedge the exchange impacts on assets and liabilities denominated in israeli shekels euros and other currencies as of december 31 2018 we had no derivative instruments we use derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts and put and call options to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on accounts receivable and forecast cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies we may not be able to purchase derivative instruments adequate to fully insulate ourselves from foreign currency exchange risks

 

additionally our hedging activities may also contribute to increased losses as a result of volatility in foreign currency markets if foreign exchange currency markets continue to be volatile such fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations in future periods also the volatility in the foreign currency markets may make it difficult to hedge our foreign currency exposures effectively

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities

 

the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain like many other multinational corporations we are subject to tax in multiple jurisdictions both in the us and outside the us our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable tax authorities any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could affect our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities these reserves may prove to be insufficient

 

in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated or by the incurrence of losses in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items

 

various levels of government such as us federal and state legislatures and international organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” and the european union are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax rate

any unauthorized access to or disclosure or theft of personal information we gather store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation

 

our business and operations may be impacted by data security breaches and cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to confidential data we receive store and use certain personal information of our customers and the endusers of our customers’ solar pv systems including names addresses email addresses credit information and energy production statistics we also store and use personal information of our employees we take steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the personal information we collect store and transmit but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we and our suppliers or vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures

 

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee or contractor error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business particularly in light of the european general data protection regulation gdpr which went into effect in may 2018 if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information were to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws

 

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws however we currently operate in and intend to further expand into many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our entry into certain jurisdictions requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from us standards it is possible that our employees subcontractors agents and partners may take actions in violation of our policies and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us to criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation

third parties might attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network or seek to compromise our products and services

from time to time we face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology it systems additionally malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide we or our products may be a target of computer hackers organizations or malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products employees and customers or interrupt our systems or those of our customers or others from time to time we encounter intrusions or attempts at gaining unauthorized access to our network to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations however there can be no guarantee that such impacts will not be material in the future while we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network and products and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools andor changes to our products we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats in addition to intentional thirdparty cybersecurity breaches the integrity and confidentiality of company and customer data may be compromised as a result of human error product defects or technological failures cybersecurity breaches whether successful or unsuccessful and other it system interruptions including those resulting from human error and technological failures could result in our incurring significant costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems reduced inventory value providing modifications to our products and services defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties 

our entry into business engagements with military bodies as our customers in the lithiumion battery and energy storage business embodies a risk for potentially largescale and uncapped liability

as a result of the kokam acquisition a small portion of our business involves the sale of products to military customers our sales to military customers often involve standard form contracts which are less subject to negotiation than the agreements we enter into in our ordinary course of business in particular certain of these contracts involve unlimited damages provisions that could result in largescale liabilities

 

we may not have sufficient insurance coverage to cover business continuity

we rely on a limited number of contracted manufacturers to manufacture our products as well as on component manufacturers which are sometimes a single source as a result a sustained or repeated interruption in the manufacturing of our products by such outsourced providers due to fire or nature disasters andor an interruption in the provision of the required components for our business by these components manufacturers may interfere with our ability to sell our products to our customers in a timely manner the described nature of our business and our size makes it difficult to insure some or all of such possible loss of profit which may adversely affect our financial results

our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments in particular we may not succeed in making additional acquisitions or be effective in integrating such acquisitions

as part of our growth strategy we have made a significant number of acquisitions we may continue to make acquisitions and investments in the future as part of our growth strategy we frequently evaluate the tactical or strategic opportunity available related to complementary businesses products or technologies there can be no assurance that we will be successful in making additional acquisitions even if we are successful in making additional acquisitions integrating an acquired company’s business into our operations or investing in new technologies may 1 result in unforeseen operating difficulties and large expenditures and 2 absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business both of which may result in the loss of key customers or personnel and expose us to unanticipated liabilities further we may not be able to retain the key employees that may be necessary to operate the business we acquire and we may not be able to attract in a timely manner new skilled employees and management to replace them

we may not be able to consummate acquisitions or investments that we have identified as crucial to the implementation of our strategy for other commercial or economic reasons further we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals including those of competition authorities and foreign investment authorities in countries where we seek to consummate acquisitions or make investments for those and other reasons we may ultimately fail to consummate an acquisition even if we announce the intended acquisition

if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected

due to our latest acquisitions goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 734 million or approximately 76 of our total assets as of december 31 2018 we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment and we assess on an asneeded basis whether there have been impairments in our other intangible assets we make assumptions and estimates in this assessment which are complex and often subjective these assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts to the extent that the factors described above change we could be required to record additional noncash impairment charges in the future which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

 

risks related to operations in israel

 

conditions in israel affect our operations and may limit our ability to develop produce and sell our products

 

although we are incorporated in delaware our headquarters and research and development center are located in israel accordingly political economic and military conditions in israel directly affect us israel has been involved in a number of armed conflicts and has been the target of terrorist activity ongoing state of hostility varying in degree such as rocket fire from the gaza strip including against civilian targets has occurred on an irregular basis disrupting daytoday civilian activity and negatively affecting business conditions israel also faces threats from hezbollah militants in lebanon and others we cannot predict whether or when such armed conflicts or attacks may occur or the extent to which such events may impact us any future armed conflict political instability or violence in the region may impede our ability to manage our business effectively or to engage in research and development or may otherwise adversely affect our business or operations in the event of war we and our israeli subcontractors and suppliers may cease operations which may cause delays in the distribution and sale of our products some of our directors executive officers and employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and are subject to being called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances in the event that our principal executive office is damaged as a result of hostile action or hostilities otherwise disrupting the ongoing operation of our offices our ability to operate could be materially adversely affected

 

additionally several countries principally in the middle east restrict doing business with israeli companies and additional countries and groups may impose similar restrictions if hostilities in israel or political instability in the region continue or increase if recent regime changes and civil wars in neighboring states result in the establishment of fundamentalist islamic regimes or governments more hostile to israel or if egypt or jordan abrogates its respective peace treaty with israel israel could be subject to additional political economic and military confines and our operations and ability to sell our products to countries in the region could be materially adversely affected these restrictions may limit materially our ability to obtain manufactured components and raw materials or to sell our products

 

any hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners or significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

the tax benefits that are available to us under israeli law require us to meet various conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future which could increase our costs and taxes

 

our israeli subsidiary is eligible for certain tax benefits provided to “benefited enterprises” under the israeli law for the encouragement of capital investments 1959 the “investments law” beginning in january 2019 and with respect to its taxable results from 2019 onwards our israeli subsidiary further elected to apply the terms of the investments law as per “ preferred enterprise” or “preferred technological enterprise” “pte”  in order to remain eligible for the tax benefits for “benefited enterprises” with respect to our israeli subsidiary’s taxable results until 2018 and with respect to its taxable results from 2019 for “ preferred enterprise” or “preferred technological enterprise” we must continue to meet certain conditions stipulated in the investments law and its regulations as amended if these tax benefits are reduced cancelled or discontinued our israeli taxable income would be subject to regular israeli corporate tax rates and we may be required to refund any tax benefits that we have already received plus interest and penalties thereon the standard corporate tax rate for israeli companies was increased to 265 in 2014 and 2015 decreased to 25 in 2016 decreased to 24 in 2017 and decreased further to 23 as of january 1 2018 additionally if we increase our activities outside of israel through acquisitions or otherwise our either existing or expanded activities might not be eligible for inclusion in existing or future israeli tax benefit programs the israeli government may furthermore independently determine to reduce phase out or eliminate entirely the benefit programs under the investments law regardless of whether we then qualify for benefits under those programs at the time which would also adversely affect our global tax rate and our results of operations

 

it may be difficult to enforce a judgment of a us court against our officers and directors to assert us securities laws claims in israel or to serve process on our officers and directors

 

the majority of our directors and executive officers reside outside of the us and most of our assets and most of the assets of these persons are located outside of the us consequently a judgment obtained against any of these persons including a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws may not be collectible in the us it also may be difficult for you to effect service of process on these persons in the us or to assert us securities law claims in original actions instituted in israel israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of us securities laws on the grounds that israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim in addition even if an israeli court hears a claim it may determine that israeli law and not us law is applicable to the claim if us law is found to be applicable the content of applicable us law must be proven as a fact by expert witnesses which can be a time consuming and costly process further an israeli court may not enforce a judgment awarded by a us or other nonisraeli court certain matters of procedure will also be governed by israeli law there is little binding case law in israel that addresses these matters as a result of the difficulty associated with enforcing a judgment against any of these persons in israel you may not be able to obtain or enforce a judgment against many of our directors and executive officers

 

risks related to the ownership of our common stock

 

we cannot assure you that our stock price will not decline or not be subject to significant volatility

 

the trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in march 2015 at a price of 1800 per share during the year ended december 31 2018 the reported high and low prices of our common stock has ranged from 3080 to 7074 per share the price of our stock may change in response to fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods and also may change in response to other factors including factors specific to companies in our industry many of which are beyond our control as a result our share price may experience significant volatility and may not necessarily reflect the value of our expected performance among other factors that could affect our stock price are

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    further the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies in addition the stock prices of many renewable energy companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial cost and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

 

the price of our common stock could decline if securities analysts or other third parties publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or if one or more of our analysts ceases to cover us or to regularly publish reports about us

 

the trading of our common stock is likely to be influenced by the reports and research that industry or securities analysts publish about us our business our market or our competitors if one or more securities or industry analysts downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price would likely decline if one or more securities or industry analysts ceases to cover the company or fails to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline

 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management

 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may believe advantageous these provisions include

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” which generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder becomes an “interested” stockholder

 

our certificate of incorporation includes a forum selection clause which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us

 

our certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder including any beneficial owner to bring i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or employees to us or to our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or iv any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine will be a state court located within the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware in all cases subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions this forum selection provision may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us it is also possible that notwithstanding the forum selection clause that is included in our certificate of incorporation a court outside of delaware   could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable

 

we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future

 

we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors subject to applicable laws and organizational documents after taking into account our financial condition results of operations capital requirements general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant as a result capital appreciation in the price of our common stock if any may be your only source of gain on an investment in our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings

 

in june 2018 we filed a lawsuit for patent infringement against huawei technologies co ltd a chinese entity huawei technologies düsseldorf gmbh a german entity and wattkraft solar gmbh a german distributor for huawei the lawsuit filed in the regional court of mannheim in germany asserts unauthorized use of patented technology and is intended to protect solaredge’s significant investment in its innovative dc optimized inverter technology seeking monetary damages an injunction and recall of infringing huawei inverters from the german market the lawsuit is intended to prevent the defendants from selling any multilevel inverters infringing upon solaredge’s pv inverter technology protected in the asserted patent in germany in july 2018 we announced the extension of this lawsuit to two additional solaredge patents covering its power optimizer technology

 

in june 2018 we were served with a complaint from a trustee of a former customer that filed for bankruptcy in the united states the lawsuit seeks to recover approximately 25 million based on theories of preferential and fraudulent transfers we believe we have valid defenses to the claims asserted in this lawsuit and we do not expect the outcome of the litigation matters to have a material adverse effect on our balance sheets statements of income or cash flows

 

on september 20 2018 our german subsidiary solaredge technologies gmbh received a complaint filed by competitor sma solar technology ag the complaint filed in the district court düsseldorf germany alleges that solaredges 125kw  276kw inverters infringe two of plaintiff’s patents in its complaint sma solar technology requests inter alia an injunction and a determination for a claim for damages for sales in germany plaintiff also asserts a value in dispute of five million euros for both patents we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit

 

in 2017 kokam received a claim for losses related to a fire that occurred at a plant of sc electric in the us to which kokam supplied products alleging that the damage was caused by a containertype ups manufactured by sc electric that contained batteries supplied by kokam the claim was originally for damages in the amount of approximately 4 million and following the kokam acquisition by us kokam received an amended claim for damages in the amount of approximately 12 million we have specific indemnification from the major selling shareholder of kokam in the amount of up to 5 million for losses that may be incurred relating to this claim kokam also has product liability insurance the claim has not developed into a lawsuit nor has kokam received the supporting documents substantiating the claimed amount we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit

 

in addition in the normal course of business we may from time to time be named as a party to various legal claims actions and complaints including as a result of initiating such legal claims action or complaints on behalf of the company it is impossible to predict with certainty whether any resulting liability would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the sections of this annual report on form 10k captioned “selected financial data” and “business” and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form 10k in addition to historical financial information the following discussion and analysis contains forward‑looking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward‑looking statements as a result of many factors including those discussed under the sections of this annual report captioned “special note regarding forward‑looking statements” and “risk factors”

 

overview

 

we are a leading provider of intelligent inverter solutions that are changing the way power is harvested and managed in solar pv systems our dc optimized inverter solution maximizes power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system our systems allow for superior power harvesting and module management by deploying power optimizers at each pv module while maintaining a competitive system cost by using a simplified dc‑ac inverter our systems are monitored through our cloud‑based monitoring platform that enables lower system operating and maintenance “om” costs we believe that these benefits along with our comprehensive and advanced safety features are highly valued by our customers

 

we are a leader in the global modulelevel power electronics “mlpe” market according to gtm research and as of december 31 2018 we have shipped approximately 341 million power optimizers and 14 million inverters more than 920000 installations many of which may include multiple inverters are currently connected to and monitored through our cloud‑based monitoring platform as of december 31 2018 we have shipped approximately 106 gw of our dc optimized inverter systems

 

we primarily sell our products directly to large solar installers epcs and indirectly to thousands of smaller solar installers through large distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers our sales strategy focuses on top‑tier customers in markets where electricity prices irradiance amount of sunlight and government policies make solar pv installations economically viable we also sell our power optimizers to several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules

 

in the year ended december 31 2018 one customer accounted for revenues of 194 and our top three customers all distributors together represented 334 of our revenues

 

we were founded in 2006 with the goal of addressing the lost power generation potential that is inherent in the use of traditional solar pv inverter technology thereby increasing the return on investment in solar pv systems the following is a chronology of some of our key milestones

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our revenues were 4898 million 2400 million 6070 million and 9372 million for fiscal 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 respectively gross margins were 310  337 354 and 341  for fiscal 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 respectively net profits were 766 million 254 million 842 million and 1288 million for fiscal 2016 for the six months ended december 31 2016 the fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 respectively

 

we continue to focus on our long‑term growth and profitability we believe that our market opportunity is large and that the transition from traditional inverter architecture to dc optimized inverter architecture will continue as the architecture of choice for distributed solar installations globally we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this market trend we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to acquire new customers in our existing markets grow internationally and drive additional revenue we also plan to expand our product offerings to further penetrate the large commercial and utility segments we expect to continue to invest in research and development to enhance our product offerings and develop new costeffective solutions

 

we believe that our strategy results in an efficient operating base with relatively low expenses that will enable profitability on lower revenues relative to our competitors we believe that our sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long‑term as we continue to grow due to economies of scale with this increased operating leverage we expect our gross and operating margins to increase in the long‑term we believe that it is too early to estimate the impact if any the newly adopted us tariff imposed on all imported solar modules and cells may have on the price of solar systems in the united states if the price of solar systems in the us increases it may reduce the number of solar systems manufactured and sold which in turn may decrease demand for our products

 

performance measures

 

in managing our business and assessing financial performance we supplement the information provided by the financial statements with other operating metrics these operating metrics are utilized by our management to evaluate our business measure our performance identify trends affecting our business and formulate projections we use metrics relating to yearly shipments inverters shipped power optimizers shipped and megawatts shipped to evaluate our sales performance and to track market acceptance of our products from year to year we use metrics relating to monitoring systems monitored and megawatts monitored to evaluate market acceptance of our products and usage of our solution

 

we provide the “megawatts shipped” metric which is calculated based on nameplate capacity shipped to show adoption of our system on a nameplate capacity basis nameplate capacity shipped is the maximum rated power output capacity of an inverter and corresponds to our financial results in that higher total capacities shipped are generally associated with higher total revenues however revenues increase with each additional unit not necessarily each additional mw of capacity sold accordingly we also provide the “inverters shipped” and “power optimizers shipped” operating metrics

 

key components of our results of operations

 

the following discussion describes certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations

 

revenues

 

we generate revenues from the sale of dc optimized inverter systems for solar pv installations which include power optimizers inverters and our cloud‑based monitoring platform our customer base mainly includes distributors large solar installers wholesalers epcs and pv module manufacturers in addition following the gamatronic acquisition and the kokam acquisition we also generate revenues from the sale of upss and l ithiumion cells batteries and energy storage solutions to endcustomers 

 

our revenues from the sale of solarrelated products are affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our dc optimized inverter systems the volume and average selling price of our systems is driven by the supply and demand for our products changes in the product mix between our residential and commercial products the customer mix between large and small customers the geographical mix of our sales sales incentives end‑user government incentives seasonality and competitive product offerings revenues from the sale of ups products are affected by the changes in the volumes sizes and average selling prices of the products we sell revenues from the sale of kokam’s products are affected by the type of product sold cell battery or system and the type of the battery that is sold

 

our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to expand our market share in each of the geographies in which we compete expand our global footprint to new evolving markets grow our production capabilities to meet demand and to continue to develop and introduce new and innovative products that address the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers our revenues from kokam are dependent on our ability to expand manufacturing capabilities and reducing costs

 

cost of revenues and gross profit

 

cost of revenues consists primarily of product costs including purchases from our contract manufacturers and other suppliers as well as costs related to shipping customer support product warranty personnel depreciation of test and manufacturing equipment hosting services for our cloud‑based monitoring platform and other logistics services our product costs are affected by technological innovations such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions economies of scale resulting in lower component costs and improvements in production processes and automation some of these costs primarily personnel and depreciation of test and manufacturing equipment are not directly affected by sales volume

 

with respect to kokam cost of revenues consists primarily of materials costs labor costs associated with the manufacturing variable utility and operational costs related to the cell and battery factories depreciation and other fixed costs

 

except for the kokam factories and final assembly of the ups systems we outsource our manufacturing to third‑party manufacturers and negotiate product pricing on a quarterly basis our third‑party manufacturers are responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products except with regard to endofline testing equipment and the automated assembly lines for our power optimizers as further described below which resulted in capital expenditures of 52 million 14 million 136 million and 90 million for fiscal 2016 for the six months ended december 31 2016 the year ended december 31 2017 and the year ended december 31 2018 respectively we expect to continue this funding arrangement in the future with respect to any expansions to such existing lines we also procure strategic and critical components from various approved vendors on behalf of our contract manufacturers at times higher than anticipated demand has exceeded the production capacities of these manufacturers in 2014 and early 2015 for example such production shortfalls as well as shortages in the supply of certain raw materials required us to use air freight rather than less expensive ocean freight to deliver the majority of our products the expansion of current manufacturing sites by our contract manufacturers allowed us to reduce these expenses in fiscal 2015 as well as to build sufficient inventory to continue our growth without the need to ship substantial amounts of products by air in 2016 we managed to continuously increase the efficiency of our supply chain reduce our reliance on air freight to a minimum and use ocean freight for the majority of our shipments

 

in 2017 and 2018 global shortages in power components used in our products and in other industries such as electrical motor drives and uninterrupted power systems ups caused disruptions to our ongoing manufacturing this phenomenon combined with increased demand for our products required us to use expensive air shipments in order to meet our delivery schedule which negatively affected our gross profit we expect component shortages to continue to affect us in upcoming quarters a combination of increased component safety stocks qualification of additional suppliers and increased capacity of our existing vendors coupled with continued expansion of the current manufacturing sites by our contract manufacturers and the development and deployment of our proprietary automated assembly line described below will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our forecasted demands with lower shipment volumes of products by air freight

 

we completed development and manufacturing our proprietary automated assembly lines for our power optimizers we expect to continue to invest in additional automated assembly lines in the future we have designed and are responsible for funding all of the capital expenses associated with existing and future automated assembly lines the current and expected capital expenses associated with these automated assembly lines will be funded out of our cash flows generation

 

key components of our logistics supply channel consist of third party distribution centers in the us europe australia and japan finished goods are either shipped to our customers directly from our contract manufacturers or shipped to thirdparty distribution centers and then finally shipped to our customers

 

cost of revenues also includes our operations and support department costs the operations department is responsible for production management such as planning procurement supply chain production methodologies and machinery planning logistics management and manufacturing support to our contract manufacturers as well as the quality assurance of our products our support department provides customer and technical support at various levels through our call centers around the world as well as second and thirdlevel support services which are provided by support personnel located in our headquarters our full‑time employee headcount in our operations production and support departments has grown from 175 as of june 30 2016 to 244 as of december 31 2016 to 348 as of december 31 2017 and to 663 as of december 31 2018

 

gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices product costs product mix customer mix geographical mix shipping method warranty costs and seasonality

 

operating expenses

 

operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnel‑related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories and include salaries benefits payroll taxes commissions and stock‑based compensation our full‑time employee headcount in our research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative departments has grown from 434 as of june 30 2016 to 475 as of december 31 2016 to 660 as of december 31 2017 and 1074 to as of december 31 2018 we expect to continue to hire significant numbers of new employees to support our growth the timing of these additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses in any particular period both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue we expect to continue to invest substantial resources to support our growth and anticipate that each of the following categories of operating expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts for the foreseeable future

 

research and development expenses net

 

research and development expenses net include personnel‑related expenses such as salaries benefits stock‑based compensation and payroll taxes our research and development employees are engaged in the design and development of power electronics semiconductors software power line communications and networking and chemistry our research and development expenses also include third‑party design and consulting costs materials for testing and evaluation asic development and licensing costs depreciation expense and other indirect costs we devote substantial resources to ongoing research and development programs that focus on enhancements to and cost efficiencies in our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation thereby maintaining our competitive position

 

research and development expenses are presented net of the amount of any grants we receive for research and development in the period in which we receive the grant we previously received grants and other funding from the binational industrial research and development foundation and the israel innovation authority the iia certain of those grants required us to pay royalties on sales of certain of our products which were recorded as cost of revenues as of december 31 2018 no such royalty obligations remained

 

sales and marketing expenses

 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel‑related expenses such as salaries sales commissions benefits payroll taxes and stock‑based compensation these expenses also include travel fees of independent consultants trade shows marketing costs associated with the operation of our sales offices and other indirect costs the expected increase in sales and marketing expenses is due to an expected increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel and the expansion of our global sales and marketing footprint enabling us to increase our penetration of new markets while most of our sales in fiscal 2012 the period beginning july 1 2011 and ending june 30 2012 were in europe sales in the us in absolute nominal value have grown steadily since fiscal 2012 with sales from the us generating revenue of 57 million compared to 5055 million in 2018 revenues generated in the us represented 682  668  575 and 539 of our revenues in fiscal 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 the year ended december 31 2017 and the year ended december 31 2018 respectively sales in europe which represented most of our sales until fiscal 2013 the period beginning july 1 2012 and ending june 30 2013 also increased and represented 227  252  327  and 320 of our revenues in fiscal 2016 in the six months ended december 31 2016 the year ended december 31 2017 and the year ended december 31 2018 respectively we currently have a sales presence in the us canada france germany italy the netherlands the united kingdom israel turkey japan australia china sweden poland india belgium korea and taiwan we intend to continue to expand our sales presence to additional countries

non‑operating expenses

 

financial income expenses

 

financial income expenses consists primarily of interest income interest expense gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations and hedging transactions

 

interest income consists of interest from our investment in available for sale marketable securities

 

interest expense consists of interest related to loans taken by kokam and advance payments received for performance obligations that extend for a period greater than one year as part of the adoption of accounting standard codification 606 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606

 

our functional currency is the us dollar with respect to certain of our subsidiaries the functional currency is the applicable local currency financial expenses net is net of financial income which consists primarily of the effect of foreign exchange differences between the us dollar and the new israeli shekel the euro and other currencies related to our monetary assets and liabilities and the realization of gain from hedging transactions

 

taxes on income

 

we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we operate

 

from incorporation through the end of fiscal 2014 we experienced operating losses and consequently accumulated a significant amount of operating loss carryforwards net in several jurisdictions by the end of fiscal 2015 we fully utilized our unused operating loss carryforwards with respect to us federal tax obligations in fiscal 2016 we recorded net income tax expenses of 04 million for federal and state tax in the us which consisted of 18 million current income tax expenses and 14 million deferred tax assets in the six months ended december 31 2016 we recorded net income tax expenses of 16 million for federal and state tax in the us which consisted of 11 million current income tax expenses and 05 million deferred tax liabilities in fiscal 2017 we recorded net income tax expenses of 198 million for federal and state tax in the us which consists of 199 million current income tax expenses and 01 million deferred tax in the year ended december 31 2018 we recorded net income tax expenses of 126 million for federal and state tax in the us which consists of 139 million current income tax expenses and 13 million deferred tax benefit

 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tcja” was signed into law making significant changes to the us income tax law changes include but are not limited to a corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 which we elected to pay over the eightyear period provided in the tcja additionally the tcja requires certain global intangible low taxed income  “ gilti ”  earned by controlled foreign corporations  “ cfcs ”  to be included in the gross income of the cfcs ’ us shareholder gaap allows us to either i treat taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “ period cost method ”  or ii factor such amounts into its measurement of deferred taxes the “ deferred method ” 

 

in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act “sab 118” which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date as a result we previously provided a provisional estimate of the effect of the tcja in its financial statements accordingly in 2017 we calculated our best estimate of the impact of the tcja in its year end income tax provision in accordance with its understanding of the tcja and guidance available as of the date of the respective filing and as a result we recorded 192 million as an additional income tax expense in the period in which the legislation was enacted

 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 upon further analyses of the tcja and proposed regulations by the us department of the treasury and the internal revenue service “irs” we completed our analysis to determine the effect of the tcja with respect to the onetime transition tax and recorded a reduction of 13 million as of december 31 2018 additionally we finalized our decision on treating the tax effects of gilti as a periodic expense evaluated the impact of the proposed regulations related to gilti and recorded a provision in the amount of 120 million for such gilti tax due to the timing of the tcja and the complexity in applying its provisions changes made in fourth quarter 2018 to our provisional amounts are based on our analysis of the tcja and additional guidance issued by the us treasury department irs fasb and other standardsetting and regulatory bodies

the investment law was amended in 2005 and was further amended as of january 1 2011 and in august 2013 the “2011 amendment” the 2011 amendment canceled the availability of the benefits granted in accordance with the provisions of the investments law prior to 2011 and instead introduced new benefits for income generated by a “preferred company” through its “preferred enterprise” both as defined in the 2011 amendment under the 2011 amendment income derived by preferred companies from preferred enterprise would be subject to a uniform rate of corporate tax for an unlimited period as opposed to the incentives prior to the 2011 amendment that were limited to income from approved or benefited enterprise during the respective benefits period according to the 2011 amendment considering the rates as amended in the 2017 amendment as defined herein the tax rate applicable to such income referred to as “preferred income” would be 75 in areas in israel that are designated as development zone a and 16 elsewhere in israel in the year 2017 and thereafter under the transitional provisions of the 2011 amendment companies may elect to irrevocably implement the 2011 amendment while waiving benefits provided under the legislation prior to the 2011 amendment or keep implementing the legislation prior to the 2011 amendment

in december 2016 amendment 73 to the investments law the “2017 amendment was published according to the 2017 amendment special tax tracks for technological enterprises have been introduced which are subject to rules that were issued by the israeli ministry of finance a technological preferred enterprise as defined in the 2017 amendment that is located in the central region of israel will be subject to tax at a rate of 12 on profits deriving from intellectual property in development zone a  a tax rate of 75

on june 14 2017 the encouragement of capital investments regulations preferred technological income and capital gain for technological enterprise 2017 the “regulations” were published the regulations describe inter alia the mechanism used to determine the calculation of the benefits under the pte regime and determine certain requirements relating to documentation of intellectual property for the purpose of the pte according to these provisions a company that complies with the terms under the pte regime may be entitled to certain tax benefits with respect to certain income generated during the company’s regular course of business and derived from the preferred intangible asset as determined in the investments law excluding certain portion of income as prescribed therein 

as of january 2019 solaredge technologies ltd elected to implement the 2011 amendment

our production facilities in israel are not located in development zone a

we are in the process of evaluation the applicability of the pte regime with respect to our business activities in israel pursuant to the 2017 amendment and the regulations and accordingly expect that solaredge technologies ltd will be entitled to an effective tax at a rate of 1399 under the 2017 amendment

 

the law for the encouragement of industry taxes 1969 the “industry encouragement law” provides certain tax benefits for an ‘industrial company’ as such term is defined in the industry encouragement law an industrial company is entitled to certain tax benefits including inter alia i amortization over an eightyear period of the cost of purchased knowhow and patents and rights to use a patent and knowhow which are used for the development or advancement of the company and ii accelerated depreciation rates on equipment and buildings eligibility for benefits under the industry encouragement law is not subject to receipt of prior approval from any governmental authority we believe that our israeli subsidiary currently qualifies as an industrial company however there can be no assurance that it will continue to so qualify or that the benefits described above will be available to it in the future furthermore the ita may determine that we do not qualify as an industrial company which could entail a loss of the benefits that relate to that status 

israeli tax law section 20a of the tax ordinance allows under certain conditions a tax deduction for certain research and development expenses as prescribed in the tax ordinance for the year in which they are paid subject to appropriate approval by the relevant israeli government ministry determined by the field of research expenses incurred in scientific research that are not approved by the relevant israeli government ministry will be deductible over a threeyear period commencing from the tax year in which they are paid our israeli subsidiary did not obtain to date such approval

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates

 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “gaap” the preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain

 

revenue recognition

 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted the accounting standards codification 606 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not substantially completed as of january 1 2018 as a result of this adoption we revised our accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed below

 

we generate revenues from the sale of dc optimized inverter systems for solar pv installations which include our power optimizers inverters and cloud‑based monitoring platform as well as other solar related products ups systems lithiumion cells batteries and energy storage solutions our worldwide customer base includes large solar installers distributors epcs pv module manufacturers utility companies and other customers our products are fully functional at the time of shipment to the customer and do not require production modification or customization with the exception of some ups and ess systems that require installation and commissioning we recognize revenue under the core principle that transfer of control to the customers should be depicted in an amount reflecting the consideration we expect to receive in revenue in order to achieve that core principle we apply the following fivestep approach 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied provisions for rebates sales incentives and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded

 

we generally sell our products to our customers pursuant to a customer’s standard purchase order and our customary terms and conditions we do not offer rights to return our products other than for normal warranty conditions and as such revenue is recorded upon shipment of products to customers and transfer of title and risk of loss under standard commercial terms we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine that appropriate credit limits are established prior to the acceptance and shipment of an order

 

we provide our full web‑based monitoring platform free of charge and revenues associated with the service since that date are being recognized ratably over 25 years in the absence of vendor‑specific objective evidence or third party comparable pricing for such service management determines the revenue levels of this service based on the costs associated with providing the service plus appropriate margins that reflect management’s best estimate of the selling price these revenues are minimal and we do not expect this to become a significant source of revenue in the near future

 

the most significant impact of the standard on our financial statements relates to advance payments received for performance obligations that extend for a period greater than one year applying the new standard such performance obligations are those that include a financing component specifically i warranty extension services ii cloudbased monitoring and iii communication services

 

we recognize financing component expenses in our consolidated statement of income in relation to advance payments for performance obligations that extend for a period greater than one year these financing component expenses are reflected in our deferred revenues balance the cumulative adjustments have decreased the retained earnings by 39 million while increasing the deferred revenues by the same amount

 

product warranty

 

we provide a standard limited product warranty for our solar products against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions our standard warranty period is 25 years for our power optimizers 12 years for our inverters and 10 years for our storage interface other products are sold with standard limited warranties that typically range in duration from one to ten years and in some cases for a longer period in certain cases customers can purchase an extended warranty for ups products and our battery storage products that exceed the standard warranty period and extended warranties for inverters that increase the warranty period to up to 25 years

 

our products are designed to meet the warranty periods and our reliability procedures cover component selection design accelerated life cycle tests and endofmanufacturing line testing however since our history in selling power optimizers and inverters is substantially shorter than the warranty period the calculation of warranty provisions is inherently uncertain

 

we accrue for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based on anticipated warranty claims and actual historical warranty claims experience warranty provisions computed on a per‑unit sold basis are based on our best estimate of such costs and are included in our cost of revenues the warranty obligation is determined based on actual and predicted failure rates of the products cost of replacement and service and delivery costs incurred to correct a product failure our warranty obligation requires management to make assumptions regarding estimated failure rates and replacement costs

 

in order to predict the failure rate of each of our products we have established a reliability model based on the estimated mean time between failures “mtbf” the mtbf represents the average elapsed time predicted for each product unit between failures during operation applying the mtbf failure rate over our install base for each product type and generation allows us to predict the number of failed units over the warranty period and estimates the costs associated with the product warranty predicted failure rates are updated periodically based on data returned from the field and new product versions as are replacement costs which are updated to reflect changes in our actual production costs for our products subcontractors’ labor costs and actual logistics costs

 

since the mtbf model does not take into account additional non‑systematic failures such as failures caused by workmanship or manufacturing or design‑related issues and since warranty claims are at times opened for cases in which the error has been triggered by an improper installation we have developed a supplemental model to predict such cases and recognize the associated expenses ratably over the expected claim period this model which is based on actual root cause analysis of returned products identification of the causes of claims and time until each identified problem is revealed allows us to better predict actual warranty expenses and is updated periodically based on our experience taking into account the installed base of approximately 341 million power optimizers and approximately 14 million inverters as of december 31 2018

 

if actual warranty costs differ significantly from these estimates adjustments may be required in the future which could adversely affect our gross profit and results of operations warranty obligations are classified as shortterm and longterm warranty obligations based on the period in which the warranty is expected to be claimed the warranty provision short and longterm was 512 million in fiscal 2016 584 million as of december 31 2016 788 million as of december 31 2017 and 1218 million as of december 31 2018

 

inventory valuation

 

our inventories comprise sellable finished goods raw materials bought for own manufacturing or on behalf of our contract manufacturers and faulty units returned under our warranty policy

 

sellable finished goods and raw material inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based on the moving average cost method certain factors could affect the realizable value of our inventories including market and economic conditions technological changes existing product changes mainly due to cost reduction activities and new product introductions we consider historic usage expected demand anticipated sales price the effect of new product introductions product obsolescence product merchantability and other factors when evaluating the value of inventories inventory write‑downs are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and their estimated fair market value inventory write‑downs are recorded as cost of revenues in the accompanying statements of operations and were 25 million 01 million 14 million and 09 million in fiscal 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 in the year ended december 31 2017 and in the year ended december 31 2018 respectively

 

faulty products returned under our warranty policy are often refurbished and used as replacement units in warranty cases such products are written off upon receipt

 

we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions that we use to record inventory at the lower of cost or market however if estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner we may be exposed to losses that could be material

 

business combination

 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require our management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired technology and other intangible assets their useful lives and discount rates our management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings

 

intangible and other long lived assets

 

we evaluate the recoverability of finitelived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any impairment charges during the year ended december 31 2018

 

acquired identifiable finitelived intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis or accelerated method over the estimated useful lives of the assets we believe the basis of amortization approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized over their estimated useful lives we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of finitelived intangible assets in case we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance is amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life

 

goodwill

 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in testing goodwill for impairment we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not than a twostep impairment test is performed we test goodwill for impairment under the twostep impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows forecasts of future cash flows are based on our management best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses that are based primarily on expected category expansion pricing and general economic conditions

 

we complete the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for the reporting unit on october 1 of each year and accordingly determines whether goodwill should be impaired as of december 31 2018 no impairment of goodwill has been identified

 

income taxes

 

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 “income taxes” asc 740 which prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse

 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc 740 asc 74010 contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that on an evaluation of the technical merits the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 cumulative probability likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates customer concentrations and interest rates we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes

 

foreign currency exchange risk

 

approximately 240 277 374 and 412 of our revenues for fiscal 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 the year ended december 31 2017 and the year ended december 31 2018 respectively were earned in non‑us dollar denominated currencies principally the euro our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located primarily the us dollar and new israeli shekel and to a lesser extent the euro our new israeli shekel‑denominated expenses consist primarily of personnel and overhead costs our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 235 million for the year ended december 31 2018 a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the new israeli shekel and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 90 million for the year ended december 31 2018

 

for purposes of our consolidated financial statements local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the us dollar on the balance sheet date and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rate as of the date of the transaction or at the average exchange rate to the us dollar during the reporting period

 

to date we have used derivative financial instruments specifically foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign currency risks by hedging a portion of our account receivable balances denominated in euros expected to be paid within six months our foreign currency forward contracts are expected to mitigate exchange rate changes related to the hedged assets we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes

 

we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of 750 million 1056 million 1647 million and 1933 million at the end of fiscal 2016 the year ending december 31 2016 the year ending december 31 2017 and the year ending december 31 2018 respectively which was held for working capital purposes in addition we had availableforsale marketable securities with an estimated fair value of 1187 million  1804 million and 1929 million on june 30 2016 december 31 2016 december 31 2017 and december 31 2018 respectively and shortterm bank deposit of 60 million as of december 31 2018 

 

we entered into forward contracts and put and call options to hedge the exchange impacts on assets and liabilities denominated in other than the us dollar as of december 31 2018 we had no outstanding forward contracts or put and call options we use derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on accounts receivable and forecast cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies we may not be able to purchase derivative instruments adequate to fully insulate ourselves from foreign currency exchange risks and over the past year we have incurred losses as a result of exchange rate fluctuations on exposures that have not been covered by our hedging strategy

 

additionally our hedging activities may also contribute to increased losses as a result of volatility in foreign currency markets if foreign exchange currency markets continue to be volatile such fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations in future periods also the volatility in the foreign currency markets may make it difficult to hedge our foreign currency exposures effectively

 

concentrations of major customers

 

our trade accounts receivables potentially expose us to a concentration of credit risk with our major customers for the year ended december 31 2018 one major customer accounted for 194 of total revenues and as of december 31 2018 two major customers accounted for approximately 413 of our consolidated trade receivables balance for the year ended december 31 2017 one major customer accounted for 148 of total revenues and as of december 31 2017 two major customers accounted for approximately 352 of our consolidated trade receivables balance we currently do not foresee a credit risk associated with these receivables

 

inflation

 

we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the last three years if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

 

commodity price risk

 

we are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials including copper which are used in our products prices of these raw materials may be affected by supply restrictions or other market factors from time to time and we do not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate commodity risk significant price changes for these raw materials could reduce our operating margins if we are unable to recover such increases from our customers and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 9a controls and procedures 

 

disclosure controls and procedures

 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of december 31 2018 in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs

 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles

 

management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018 management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework management’s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment

 

management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the purchased gamatronic business or the business of kokam co ltd that were acquired during 2018 and included in the 2018 consolidated financial statements of the company and constituted 101 and 108 of total and net assets respectively as of december 31 2018 and 24 of revenues for the year then ended our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the purchased gamatronic business or of kokam co ltd 

 

based on this assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors

 

our independent registered public accounting firm kost forer gabbay  kasierer a member of ernst  young independently assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in the firm’s attestation report which is incorporated by reference into part ii item 8 of this form 10k

 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how welldesigned and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

changes in internal control over financial reporting

 

following adoption of asc 606 guidance on january 1 2018 we implemented changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and the related control activities there were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting due to the adoption of this new standard

 

following the acquisition of kokam and gamatronics business we implemented new processes related to business combination and intangiblegoodwill and the related control activities

introduction

 

we have invented an intelligent inverter solution that has changed the way power is harvested and managed in a solar pv system our direct current “dc” optimized inverter system maximizes power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system and providing comprehensive and advanced safety features our system consists of our power optimizers inverters and cloud‑based monitoring platform and addresses a broad range of solar market segments from residential solar installations to commercial and small utility‑scale solar installations since we began commercial shipments in 2010 we have shipped approximately 67 gigawatts “gw” of our dc optimized inverter systems and our products have been installed in solar pv systems in 121 countries

 

historically the solar pv industry used traditional string and central inverter architectures to harvest pv solar power however traditional inverter architectures result in energy losses as well as systemic challenges in design flexibility safety and monitoring more recently microinverter technology was introduced in an attempt to resolve these challenges but this technology has certain inherent limitations we believe that our dc optimized inverter system consisting of an inverter and distributed power optimizers best addresses all of these challenges

 

our system allows for superior power harvesting and module management relative to traditional inverter systems by deploying power optimizers at each pv module while maintaining a competitive system cost by keeping the ac inversion and grid interaction centralized using a simplified dc‑ac inverter the entire system is monitored through our cloud‑based monitoring platform that enables reduced system operation and maintenance “om” costs our system enables each pv module to operate at its own maximum power point “mpp” rather than a system‑wide average enabling dynamic response to real‑world conditions such as atmospheric conditions pv module aging soiling and shading and offering improved energy yield relative to traditional inverter systems in addition to higher efficiency our system’s installed cost per watt is competitive with traditional inverter systems of leading manufacturers and generally lower than comparable microinverter systems of leading manufacturers furthermore our architecture allows for complex rooftop system designs and enhanced safety and reliability our technology and system architecture are protected by 121 awarded patents and 161 patent applications filed worldwide as of december 31 2017

 

we primarily sell our products indirectly to thousands of solar installers through large distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers and directly to large solar installers and engineering procurement and construction firms “epcs” our customers include leading providers of solar pv systems to residential and commercial end users key solar distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers as well as several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules

 

we were founded in 2006 and began commercial shipments in 2010 as of december 31 2017 we have shipped approximately 227 million power optimizers and 950000 inverters more than 560000 installations many of which may include multiple inverters are currently connected to and monitored through our cloud‑based monitoring platform

 

limitations of existing technologies

 

a solar pv system consists of pv modules which produce direct current “dc” power when exposed to sunlight an inverter which transforms the dc power into alternating current “ac” power that is required by the electricity grid and associated cabling fuse boxes and mounting hardware traditionally solar pv systems connected strings of solar pv modules to one or more inverters for this energy conversion

 

traditional inverter architecture still constitutes the vast majority of the pv inverter market especially for larger commercial and utility installations however traditional inverter architecture suffers from significant inefficiencies leading to suboptimal power generation these challenges include

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition to power losses the traditional inverter architecture also has system design installation and operational challenges including

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first generation of module level power electronics “mlpe” was the microinverter this technology scaled down the traditional inverter to a size and power appropriate to a single pv module by creating control and monitoring at the module level microinverters solved certain challenges of the traditional inverter system architecture however microinverter architecture has its own limitations such as

 

 

 

 

 

the solaredge solution

 

our dc optimized inverter system maximizes power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system and providing comprehensive and advanced safety features our solution consists of our power optimizers inverters and cloud‑based monitoring platform and addresses a broad range of solar market segments from residential solar installations to commercial and small utility‑scale solar installations additional features and hardware that can be added to our solution includes a battery pack for storage of energy generated and a home energy automation system which enables greater savings for the system owner we also recently announced the first inverterintegrated electric vehicle ev charger

 

the key advantages of our solution include

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our products

 

our basic solution consists of a dc power optimizer an inverter and a cloudbased monitoring platform that operate as a single integrated system

 

solaredge power optimizer   our dc power optimizer is a highly reliable and efficient dc‑to‑dc converter which is connected by installers to each pv module or embedded by pv module manufacturers into their modules as part of the manufacturing process our power optimizer increases energy output from the pv module to which it is connected by continuously tracking the mpp of each module and controlling its working point the power optimizer’s ability to track the mpp of each pv module and its ability to increase or decrease its output voltage enables the inverter’s input voltage to remain fixed under a large variety of string configurations this feature enhances flexibility in pv system designs enabling use of different string lengths in a single pv system connected to the same inverter use of pv panels situated on multiple orientations connected to the same inverter and using varied pv module types in the same string in addition our power optimizers monitor the performance of each pv module and communicates this data to our inverter using our proprietary power line communication in turn the inverter transmits this information to our monitoring server each power optimizer is equipped with our proprietary safety mechanism which automatically reduces the output voltage of each power optimizer to 1v unless the power optimizer receives a fail‑safe signal from a functioning inverter as a result if the inverter is shut down eg for system maintenance due to malfunction in the event of a fire or otherwise the dc voltage throughout the system is reduced to a safe level

 

our power optimizers are designed to withstand high temperatures and harsh environmental conditions and contain multiple bypass features that localize failures and enable continued system operation in the vast majority of cases of power optimizer failure our power optimizers are compatible with the vast majority of modules on the market today and carry a 25‑year product warranty our power optimizers are designed to be used with our inverters as well as third party inverters to provide power optimization monitoring and safety features can also be achieved with third party inverters by adding supplemental communications hardware during fiscal 2015 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 and the year ended december 31 2017 revenues derived from the sale of power optimizers represented 488 500 480 and 473 of total revenues respectively

 

solaredge inverter   our dc‑to‑ac inverters contain sophisticated digital control technology with efficient power conversion architecture resulting in superior solar power harvesting and high reliability and are designed to work exclusively with our dc power optimizers a proprietary power line communication receiver is integrated into each inverter receiving data from our power optimizers storing this data and transmitting it to our monitoring server when an internet connection exists since each string which is equipped with our power optimizers provides fixed input voltage to our inverter the inverter is able to operate at its highest efficiency at all times and therefore is more cost‑efficient energy efficient and reliable like our power optimizers our inverters are designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions since the power rating of an inverter determines how many pv modules it can serve larger installations require inverters with higher power ratings we currently offer our second generation of inverters which come in two models a one‑phase inverter designed to address the residential market 1 kilowatt “kw” to 114 kw which includes our hdwave technology and our newly introduced inverterintegrated electric vehicle ev charger and a three‑phase inverter designed to address the residential market in certain european countries and the commercial market 4 kw to 100 kw in june 2017 we introduced an extended commercial solution that consists of various inverters sized 55kw 825kw and 100kw these inverters are designed for commercial installations reduce the number of required inverters and increase the system return on investment the vast majority of our inverters are sold with a 12‑year warranty that is extendable to 20 or 25 years for an additional cost during fiscal 2015 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 and the year ended december 31 2017 revenues derived from the sale of inverters represented 483 457 469 and 479 of total revenues respectively

 

storedge® solutions our storedge solution is a dc coupled solution that is used to increase energy independence and maximize selfconsumption for homeowners by utilizing a battery which is sold separately by third party manufacturers to store and supply power as needed the solution is based on a single inverter for both solar pv and storage our storedge solution is designed to provide smart energy functions such as maximizing selfconsumption timeofuse programming for desired hours of the day and home energy backup solutions to optimize selfconsumption the battery is charged and discharged to meet consumption needs and reduce the amount of power purchased from the grid with a backup solution unused solar pv power is stored in a battery and used during a power outage or when solar pv production is insufficient when there is a power outage a combination of solar pv power and battery is used to power important sources such as the refrigerator communication devices lighting and ac outlets our proprietary monitoring platform provides visibility into battery status solar pv production and selfconsumption while offering easy maintenance with remote access to inverter and battery software existing solaredge systems can be upgraded to our storedge solution

solaredge monitoring software   our cloud‑based monitoring platform collects power voltage current and system data sent from our inverters and power optimizers and allows users to view the data at the module level string level inverter level and system level from any browser or from most smart phones and tablets the monitoring software continuously analyzes data and flags potential problems the monitoring software includes features which are used on a routine basis by integrators installers maintenance staff and system owners to improve a solar pv system’s performance by maximizing solar power harvesting and reducing om costs by increasing system up‑time and detecting pv module performance issues more effectively connection to the monitoring server is completed during installation by the installer the installer then receives full access to system data through the monitoring software and can select the amount of data to be shared with the system owner

power optimizers   we currently sell our third generation power optimizer which was designed for fully automated assembly and which is based on our third generation asic a key element of our reliability strategy and a significant differentiator relative to our competitors is our use of proprietary asics to control among other things our power optimizer’s power conversion safety features and pv module monitoring instead of using large numbers of discrete components our power optimizer uses a single proprietary asic thus reducing the total number of components in an electrical circuit and thereby improving reliability in june 2017 we unveiled our fourth generation optimizer which uses fourth generation asic and incorporates a new safety mechanism for pv systems in addition we are also continuing to develop the necessary subsystems for the fifth generation asic which will be used in our fifth generation power optimizer each new asic generation reduces the number of components required and meaningfully improved the efficiency of the power optimizer the efficiency improvement reduces the energy losses which in turn reduces the amount of heat dissipation this enables design of a more costeffective and usually smaller enclosure and also keeps the electronics cooler thereby improving the power optimizer’s reliability

 

inverters   our inverter roadmap is intended to serve three purposes i expand addressable market by developing new and larger inverters designed specifically for larger commercial installations and utility‑scale projects ii improve the electronics to increase the total power throughput without changing the existing enclosure thereby reducing the actual cost per watt and increasing economies of scale and iii improve ease of installation by integrating additional functionality required in certain installations in order to reduce costs of additional hardware and subcontractors’ labor costs as part of our inverter roadmap we plan to apply our hdwave technology to threephase inverters and we are in the development process for doing so

 

monitoring services   our cloud‑based monitoring platform is continuously growing by the amount of data aggregated we are continuously developing tools to accommodate our growth and further enhance our service offering specifically we plan to increase data compression in order to enable support for a rapidly increasing number of field systems while using low‑cost equipment in addition we plan to improve our reporting systems and enable users to obtain self‑generated customized reports we also expect to expand algorithms that detect and pinpoint problems that can affect power production in field systems we further plan to add more capabilities through our public application program interface to allow users to build and integrate our system into their own systems and to allow users to build and share useful applications based on monitoring data gathered by our software

 

energy storage and shifting   solaredge is working to continue to expand its thirdparty battery compatibility for the residential market for the commercial market we plan to expand our storedge product offering to the commercial and industrial sector

 

smart energy management there are currently two separate energy technology industries that exist today solar energy production and building automation technology we believe that inverters will be taking on an expanded role in energy management and automation and in conjunction with this assumption we are developing building automation products that can combine both of these industries this line of products when used with the solaredge solution will be designed to allow system owners to increase selfconsumption by shifting energy usage to match peak solar pv production as well as offer a convenient wireless control option over various building and home devices an example of this solution would be using excess solar pv energy to heat water or the ability to remotely turn on or off certain power sources such as lighting or electrical appliances the introduction of these products is dependent upon certification and region specific needs and as such cannot yet be specified

 

new products or product categories  we are evaluating opportunities to expand our product offerings and services to our customers we may from time to time develop new products or services that are a natural extension of our existing business or may engage in acquisitions of businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our market position enable us to enter attractive markets expand our technological capabilities or provide synergy opportunities

 

sales and marketing strategy

 

since commencing sales activities in early 2010 our strategy has been to focus on markets where electricity prices irradiance and government policies make solar pv installations economically viable today our products have been installed in over 120 countries including the us canada germany italy the netherlands the united kingdom israel australia japan singapore india taiwan south africa belgium france and china

 

we target our sales and marketing efforts to the largest distributors electrical equipment wholesalers epc contractors and installers in each of the countries where we operate in the us germany italy the united kingdom and australia our products are carried and actively sold by most of the top solar pv distributors as well as the largest electrical distribution companies that are active in solar pv we anticipate that an increasing percentage of solar pv equipment sales will also occur through electrical equipment wholesalers who sell to a broad range of electrical contractors and we are focused on cultivating these global relationships as of december 31 2017 according to the data available on our monitoring portal approximately 17200 installers around the world have installed solaredge solar pv systems we also sell our power optimizers to several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules

 

additionally we have a number of programs focused on educating installers and other industry professionals about our technology and we use a combination of road shows webinars and partner trainings to show them how best to design sell and implement our technology in their projects

 

our customers

 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from key solar distributors electrical equipment wholesalers and large installers in the us and worldwide in fiscal 2017 three of our customers represented 299  of our revenues out of these three customers consolidated electrical distributors inc ced a leading electricequipment wholesaler in the us was our largest customer and accounted for 148 of our revenues none of our other customers accounted for more than ten percent of our revenues in fiscal 2017

 

training and customer support

 

we offer our installer base a comprehensive package of customer support and training services which include pre‑sales support ongoing trainings and technical support before during and after installation we also provide customized support programs to pv module manufacturers large installers and distributors to help prioritize and track support issues thereby enabling short cycle times for issue resolution in 2017 we conducted approximately 160 training events in 17 countries with an aggregate of approximately 4100 attendees

 

we offer a wide variety of training including hands‑on and on‑demand video sessions and online product and training materials we support our commercial system customers with design consulting throughout their sales process and installation our technical support organization includes local expert teams call centers in the usa germany australia netherlands italy the united kingdom and israel and an online service portal our toll‑free call centers are open monday through friday from 900 am to 800 pm in every region in which we sell our products in addition customers can open and track support cases 247 utilizing our online portal all support cases are monitored via a customer relationship management system in order to ensure service track closure of all customer issues and further improve our customer service our call centers have access to our cloud‑based monitoring platform database which enables real‑time remote diagnostics

 

customer service and satisfaction has been a key component of our business and we expect it to continue to be integral to our success in the future we maintain high levels of customer engagement through our call centers in california germany and israel in addition to our call centers we have field service engineers located in the geographies where we are active and support our customers with commissioning of large projects introduction of new technologies and features and on‑the‑job training of new installers as of december 31 2017 our customer support and training organization consisted of 184 employees worldwide

 

our technology

 

we have drawn on our expertise in the fields of power electronics magnetic design mechanical and heat dissipation capabilities control loops and algorithms and power line communications to design and develop what we believe to be the most advanced commercial solutions for harvesting power from solar pv systems our advanced technologies are explained in more detail below

 

power optimizers

 

our power optimizers are dcdc step upstep down buck‑boost converters designed and developed to operate in harsh outdoor environments at very high conversion efficiency our power optimizers include proprietary power electronics customized to efficiently convert power from the pv module to the inverter the conversion topology and components are all designed for the power optimizer specifications and verified for consistent performance and reliability in numerous lab tests and simulations

 

a key factor in the performance of our power optimizer is determined by the digital control algorithms and closed‑loop mechanism the power optimizer’s control is built into our advanced asic which is responsible for all critical digital control functions of the power optimizer including detailed power analysis digital control of the power conversion subsystem and power line communications and networking since each power optimizer handles the power and voltage of a single module we are able to reach a high degree of semiconductor integration by leveraging low cost silicon in standard semiconductor packages as a result much of the functionality of our power optimizer can be integrated into a standard asic instead of discrete electronic components resulting in lower costs and higher reliability

 

the asic performs the critical power analysis and power conversion control functions of the power optimizer the power analysis function processes the status and working parameters at the power optimizer’s input and output and together with advanced digital control and state machine logic controls the power conversion function in addition our digital control system uses technology that allows the solar pv installation to anticipate and adapt to changing operating conditions and protect against system anomalies

 

each power optimizer in the array is connected to the inverter by a power line communications networking link our power line communications link uses a proprietary networking technology that we developed utilizing the existing dc wiring between the power optimizers and the inverter to transmit and receive data between these devices

 

inverters

 

our inverter is designed for single‑stage dcac conversion using our inverter in combination with the power optimizers will allow the control loop to maintain a fixed dc voltage level at its input thereby allowing for longer uneven and multi‑faceted strings while also enabling custom cost–efficient and reliable inverter design and component selection all of the power components as well as the main magnetic components for our inverters can then be optimized for dcac inversion at high efficiency

 

the digital control algorithms of our inverters are implemented using programmable digital signal processors which allow for flexibility and adaptation of control loops for various grids and for the requirements and standards of various grid operators across geographies we have already implemented the control mechanisms necessary to support advanced grid codes and standards that are required to support high penetration of solar energy into the grid

 

manufacturing

 

we have designed our manufacturing processes to produce high quality products at competitive costs the strategy is threefold outsource automate and localize we have outsourcing agreements with three of the world’s leading global electronics manufacturing service providers jabil circuit inc celestica llc and flextronics industrial ltd by using these contract manufacturers rather than building our own manufacturing infrastructure we are able to access advanced manufacturing equipment processes skills and capacity on a “capital light” budget our contract manufacturers are responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products except with regard to endofline testing equipment and other specific manufacturing equipment utilized in assembling our products or subcomponents which are financed and owned by the company we expect to continue this funding arrangement in the future with respect to any expansions to such existing lines further contracting with global providers such as jabil celestica and flextronics gives us added flexibility to manufacture certain products in china closer to target markets in asia and the north american west coast as well as other products in romania and hungary closer to target markets in europe and the north american east coast potentially increasing responsiveness to customers while reducing costs and delivery times in july 2017 we executed a long term lease agreement for 10000 square meters in israel intended for the establishment of a manufacturing facility for the production of product prototypes manufacturing and the development of proprietary manufacturing and testing equipment the facility is under development

 

we have developed propriety automated assembly lines for the manufacturing of our power optimizers these assembly lines currently operating in all of our manufacturing facilities enable the manufacturing of more than 4000 optimizers per machine per day we invest resources in additional automated assembly lines as well as in automated machinery for subassembly of certain components used in our products and we own and are responsible for funding all of the capital expenses related thereto the current and expected capital expenses associated with these automated assembly lines and other machinery are not significant and will be funded out of our cash flows in addition we are in the process of designing an automatic assembly line for the production of embedded optimizers

 

we source our raw materials through various component manufacturers and invest resources in continued costreduction efforts as well as verifying second and third sources so as to limit dependence on sole suppliers

 

reliability and quality control

 

our power optimizers are either connected to each pv module by installers or embedded in each pv module by pv module manufacturers our power optimizers are designed to be as reliable as the pv module itself and capable of withstanding the same operating and environmental conditions

 

our reliability methodology includes a multi‑level plan with design analysis sub‑system testing of critical components by accelerated life testing and integrative testing of design prototypes by highly accelerated life testing and large sample groups as part of our reliability efforts we subject components to industry standard conditions and tests including in accelerated life chambers that simulate burn‑in thermal cycling damp‑heat and other stresses we also conduct out of box audits oba on our finished products online reliability tests ort are conducted on our inverters and we test complete products in stress tests and in the field our rigorous testing processes have helped us to develop highly reliable products

 

in order to verify the quality of each of our products when it leaves the manufacturing plant each component sub‑assembly and final product are tested multiple times during production these tests include automatic optical inspection in‑circuit testing board‑ functional testing safety testing and integrative stress testing we employ a serial number‑driven manufacturing process auditing and traceability system that allows us to control production line activities verify correct manufacturing processes and to achieve item‑specific traceability

 

as a part of our quality and reliability approach failed products from the field are returned and subjected to root cause analysis the results of which are used to improve our product and manufacturing processes and design and further reduce our field failure rate

 

certifications

 

our products and systems comply with the applicable regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are sold as well as all other major markets around the world these include safety regulations electromagnetic compatibility standards and grid compliance

 

research and development

 

we devote substantial resources to research and development with the objective of developing new products and systems adding new features to existing products and systems and reducing unit costs of our products and systems our development strategy is to identify features products and systems for both software and hardware that reduce the cost and improve the effectiveness of our solutions for our customers we measure the effectiveness of our research and development by metrics including product unit cost efficiency reliability power output and ease of use

 

we have a strong research and development team with wide‑ranging experience in power electronics semiconductors power line communications and networking and software engineering in addition many members of our team have expertise in solar technologies as of december 31 2017 our research and development organization had a headcount of 367 employees our research and development expense net totaled 220 million 332 million 203 million and 550 million for fiscal 2015 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 and the year ended december 31 2017 respectively

 

intellectual property

 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies information processes and know‑how we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws in the us and similar laws in other countries confidentiality agreements and procedures and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology as of december 31 2017 we had 84 issued us patents 37 issued non‑us patents 83 patent applications pending for examination in the us and 78 patent applications pending for examination in other countries all of which are related to us applications a majority of our patents relate to dc power optimization and dc to ac conversion for alternative energy power systems power system monitoring and control and management systems our issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2024 and 2035 we continually assess opportunities to seek patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages

 

we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests with respect to proprietary know‑how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we believe that many elements of our manufacturing processes involve proprietary know‑how technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes test equipment designs algorithms and procedures

 

all of our research and development personnel are required to enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us

 

our customers and business partners are required to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans

 

competition

 

the markets for our products are competitive and we compete with manufacturers of traditional inverters and manufacturers of other mlpe the principal areas in which we compete with other companies include

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our dc optimized inverter system competes principally with products from traditional inverter manufacturers such as sma solar technology ag abb ltd and huawei technologies co ltd as well as from other new chinese inverter manufacturers in the north american residential market we compete with traditional inverter manufacturers as well as microinverter manufacturers such as enphase energy inc in addition several new entrants to the mlpe market including low‑cost asian manufacturers have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped similar products we believe that our dc optimized inverter system offers significant technology and cost advantages that reflect a competitive differentiation over traditional inverter systems and microinverter technologies

 

government incentives

 

us federal state and local government bodies as well as nonus government bodies provide incentives to owners end users distributors and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar pv systems from property tax assessments the market for on‑grid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of these government subsidies and economic incentives which vary by geographic market and from time to time in general the amount and availability of these incentives and subsidies to encourage the development of solar pv energy have been declining and are expected to continue to decline

 

import tariffs

 

on january 22 2018 a tariff was adopted in the us on imported solar modules and cells approving with limited changes the recommendation of the us international trade commission that was announced on october 31 2017 an initial 30 tariff was imposed on all imported solar modules and cells with a gradual reduction over four years to 15 these tariffs do not apply directly to our products it is uncertain what effect if any these tariffs may have on the price of solar systems in the united states if the price of solar systems in the us increases it would likely reduce the number of solar systems manufactured and sold which in turn may decrease demand for our products

 

seasonality

 

the solar energy market is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations affected by weather for example during the winter months in europe and the northeastern us where the climate is particularly cold and snowy it is typical to see a decline in pv installations and this decline can impact the timing of orders for our products

 

employees

 

as of december 31 2017 we had 1007 full‑time employees of these full‑time employees 367 were engaged in research and development 210 in sales and marketing 348 in operations and support and 82 in general and administrative capacities of our employees 606 were based in israel 143 were based in the us 83 were based in china 49 were based in germany and an additional 126 were based elsewhere

 

none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced any employmentrelated work stoppages and we consider relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors

tableend 

 

risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in particular forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties some of which cannot be predicted or quantified see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements”

 

risks related to our business and our industry

 

we cannot be certain that we will sustain our current level of profitability in the future

 

we achieved a net profit of 211 million 766 million 254 million and 842 million in fiscal 2015 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 and the year ended december 31 2017 respectively our revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons many of which are outside our control including a decline in demand for our products increased competition a decrease in the growth of the solar industry or our market share or our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities if we fail to maintain sufficient revenue to support our operations we may not be able to sustain profitability

 

in addition we expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business including in connection with marketing and developing our products development of our own manufacturing facilities expanding into new product markets and geographies maintaining and enhancing our research and development operations and hiring additional personnel we do not know whether our revenues will grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs and our limited operating history makes it difficult to assess the extent of these expenses or their impact on our results of operations

 

the rapidly evolving and competitive nature of our industry makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects

 

our first full fiscal year of commercial shipments was 2011 and much of our growth has occurred in recent periods this operating history combined with the rapidly evolving and competitive nature of our industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects in addition we have limited insight into emerging trends that may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries including unpredictable and volatile revenues and increased expenses as we continue to grow our business the viability and demand for solar energy solutions and in turn our products may be affected by many factors outside of our control including

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

if we do not manage these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully our business and results of operations will suffer

 

if demand for solar energy solutions does not continue to grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our business and results of operations will suffer

 

our solution is utilized in solar pv installations as a result our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years and we cannot be certain that consumers and businesses with respect to distributed solar solutions or utilities with respect to utilityscale solar projects will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to grow our business if demand for solar energy solutions fails to develop sufficiently demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business

 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business  

federal state local and foreign government bodies provide incentives to owners end users distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments payments of renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar pv systems from property tax assessments the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market because our customers’ sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business for example in august 2015 the united kingdom’s department of energy and climate change decc launched a consultation on the future of the feedin tariffs fits scheme the consultation reduced the levels of fit effective february 2016 under the new fit scheme uk solar installations have significantly dropped these subsidies and incentives may expire on a particular date end when the allocated funding is exhausted or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase or as a result of legal challenges the adoption of new statutes or regulations or the passage of time these reductions or terminations often occur without warning

 

in addition several jurisdictions have adopted renewable portfolio standards which mandate that a certain portion of electricity delivered by utilities to customers come from a set of eligible renewable energy resources by a certain compliance date some programs further specify that a portion of the renewable energy quota must be from solar electricity under some programs a utility can receive a “credit” for renewable energy produced by a third party by either purchasing the electricity directly from the producer or paying a fee to obtain the right to renewable energy generated but used by the generator or sold to another party a renewable energy credit allows the utility to add this electricity to its renewable portfolio requirement total without actually expending the capital for generating facilities however there can be no assurances that such policies will continue for example in december 2015 nevadas public utilities commission increased the fixed service charge for netmetered solar customers and lowered compensation for net excess solar generation proposals to extend compliance deadlines reduce targets or repeal standards have also been introduced in a number of states reduction or elimination of renewable portfolio standards or successful efforts to meet current standards could harm or halt the growth of the solar pv industry and our business

 

changes in the us trade environment including the recent imposition of import tariffs could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenues results of operations or cash flows

on january 22 2018 a tariff on imported solar modules and cells was adopted in the united states the approved taxation imposes an initial 30 tariff on all imported solar modules and cells with a gradual reduction over four years to 15 these tariffs do not apply directly to our products however these tariffs have created uncertainty in the industry concerning whether they will cause a material increase in the price of solar systems in the us if the price of solar systems in the us increases the use of solar would become less economically feasible and would likely reduce the number of solar systems manufactured and sold which in turn may decrease demand for our products such outcomes could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenues of operations or cash flows and continuing uncertainty could cause sales volatility price fluctuations or supply shortages or cause our customers to advance or delay their purchase of our products

 

changes to net metering policies may significantly reduce demand for electricity from solar pv systems and harm our business

 

our business benefits from favorable net metering policies in several us states canadian provinces and european countries in which our customers operate net metering allows a solar pv system owner to pay his or her local electric utility only for power usage net of production from the solar pv system transforming the conventional relationship between customers and traditional utilities system owners receive credit for the energy that the solar installation generates to offset energy usage at times when the solar installation is not generating energy under a net metering program the customer typically pays for the net energy used or receives a credit against future bills at the retail rate if more energy is produced than consumed in some locations customers are also reimbursed by the electric utility for net excess generation on a periodic basis

 

most us states have adopted some form of net metering however net metering programs have recently come under regulatory scrutiny in some us states due to challenges alleging that net metering policies inequitably shift costs onto nonsolar ratepayers by allowing solar ratepayers to sell electricity at rates that are too high for utilities to recoup their fixed costs we cannot assure you that the programs will not be significantly modified going forward

 

if the value of the credit that customers receive for net metering is significantly reduced endusers may be unable to recognize the same level of cost savings associated with net metering that current endusers enjoy the absence of favorable net metering policies or of net metering entirely or the imposition of new charges that only or disproportionately affect endusers that use net metering would significantly limit demand for solar pv systems that are sold by our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future growth

 

existing electric utility industry regulations and changes to regulations may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar pv systems that may significantly reduce demand for our products or harm our ability to compete

 

federal state local and foreign government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry and internal policies and regulations promulgated by electric utilities heavily influence the market for electricity generation products and services these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and the interconnection of customerowned electricity generation and governments and utilities continuously modify these regulations and policies these regulations and policies could deter purchases of renewable energy products including solar pv systems sold by our customers this could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for our products for example utilities commonly charge fees to larger industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for backup purposes these fees could increase the cost to use solar pv systems sold by our customers and make them less desirable thereby harming our business prospects financial condition and results of operations in addition depending on the region electricity generated by solar pv systems competes most effectively with expensive peakhour electricity from the electric grid rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the utilities’ peak hour pricing policies or rate design such as to a flat rate could require the price of solar pv systems and their component parts to be lower in order to compete with the price of electricity from the electric grid

 

changes in current laws or regulations applicable to us or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the us europe or other jurisdictions in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations any changes to government or internal utility regulations and policies that favor electric utilities could reduce the competitiveness of solar pv systems sold by our customers and cause a significant reduction in demand for our products and services for example regulators in certain us states have been asked to consider proposals to assess fees on consumers purchasing energy from solar pv systems or imposing a new charge that would disproportionately impact solar pv system owners who utilize net metering either of which would increase the cost of solar pv energy to those consumers and could reduce demand for our products any similar government or utility policies adopted in the future that discourage the growth of solar pv systems could reduce demand for our products and services and adversely impact our growth in addition changes in our products or changes in export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects

 

decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid would make the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and would likely lower sales of our products the price of electricity derived from the utility grid could decrease as a result of

 

•   construction of a significant number of new power generation plants including plants utilizing natural gas nuclear coal renewable energy or other generation technologies 

•   relief of transmission constraints that enable local centers to generate energy less expensively 

 

•   reductions in the price of natural gas 

 

•   utility rate adjustment and customer class cost reallocation 

 

•   energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce electricity consumption 

 

•   development of smartgrid technologies that lower the peak energy requirements of a utility generation facility 

 

 

 

•   development of new energy generation technologies that provide less expensive energy 

moreover technological developments in the solar components industry could allow our competitors and their customers to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be achieved by us and our customers which could result in reduced demand for our products

 

if the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations incorporating our systems is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed

 

an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a solar pv system and could reduce the demand for solar systems and thus demand for our products

 

many endusers depend on financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build or purchase a solar pv system as a result an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or their customers the endusers to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a solar pv system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our products which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of endusers install solar pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through financing an increase in interest rates could lower such enduser’s return on investment on a solar pv system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar pv systems and in each case could cause such endusers to seek alternative investments

 

the market for our products is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce power optimizer inverter and solar pv system monitoring products which could negatively affect our results of operations and market share

 

the market for solar pv solutions is highly competitive we principally compete with traditional inverter manufacturers as well as microinverter manufacturers currently our dc optimized inverter system competes with products from traditional inverter manufacturers and microinverter manufacturers as well as emerging technology companies offering alternative mlpe products several new entrants to the inverter and mlpe market including lowcost asian manufacturers have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped products in markets in which we sell our products including most recently with respect to sales in australia and in europe we expect competition to intensify as new and existing competitors enter the market

 

several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger have greater financial marketing distribution customer support and other resources are longer established and have better brand recognition further certain competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than us may partner with other competitors to provide combined technologies and competing solutions and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours in addition some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices for our products in order to compete effectively if we have to reduce our prices by more than we anticipated or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer

 

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may have a material adverse effect on demand for our offerings

 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advances in other forms of distributed solar pv power generation storage solutions such as batteries the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could result in product obsolescence the loss of competitiveness of our products decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors

 

our industry has historically been cyclical and experienced periodic downturns

 

our future success partly depends on continued demand for solar pv systems in the endmarkets we serve including the residential and commercial sectors in the united states and europe the solar industry has historically been cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns which may affect the demand for equipment that we manufacture the solar industry has undergone challenging business conditions in recent years including downward pricing pressure for pv modules mainly as a result of overproduction and reductions in applicable governmental subsidies contributing to demand decreases although the solar industry is experiencing a slow recovery there is no assurance that the solar industry will not suffer significant downturns in the future which will adversely affect demand for our solar products and our results of operations

 

defects or performance problems in our products could result in loss of customers reputational damage and decreased revenue and we may face warranty indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products

 

although our products meet our stringent quality requirements they may contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new generations are released errors defects or poor performance can arise due to design flaws defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties which can affect both the quality and the yield of the product any actual or perceived errors defects or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products shipment delays rejection of our products damage to our reputation lost revenue diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and increases in customer service and support costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

furthermore defective components may give rise to warranty indemnity or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive from the affected products we offer a minimum 12year limited warranty for our inverters and a 25year limited warranty for our power optimizers our limited warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship of our products under normal use and service conditions as a result we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold products and recognized revenue while we do have accrued reserves for warranty claims our estimated warranty costs for previously sold products may change to the extent future products are not compatible with earlier generation products under warranty our warranty accruals are based on our assumptions and we do not have a long history of making such assumptions as a result these assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our systems causing us to incur substantial unanticipated expense to repair or replace defective products in the future or to compensate customers for defective products our failure to accurately predict future claims could result in unexpected volatility in and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

 

if one of our products were to cause injury to someone or cause property damage including as a result of product malfunctions defects or improper installation then we could be exposed to product liability claims we could incur significant costs and liabilities if we are sued and if damages are awarded against us further any product liability claim we face could be expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention the successful assertion of a product liability claim against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages penalties or fines subject us to adverse publicity damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely affect sales of our products in addition product liability claims injuries defects or other problems experienced by other companies in the residential solar industry could lead to unfavorable market conditions for the industry as a whole and may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract new customers thus harming our growth and financial performance

 

if we do not forecast demand for our products accurately we may experience product shortages delays in product shipment excess product inventory or difficulties in planning expenses which will adversely affect our business and financial condition

 

our products are manufactured according to our estimates of customer demand which requires us to make multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to demand from solar pv installers and distributors their end customers and general market conditions because we sell a large portion of our products to larger solar installers and various distributors who in turn sell to local installers who in turn sell to their end customers the system owner we have limited visibility as to end customer demand and it is difficult to forecast future enduser demand to plan our operations if we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are cancelled or shipments are delayed we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell conversely if we underestimate demand we may not have sufficient inventory to meet end customer demand or to ramp up production at our contract manufacturers in a timely manner or we could incur additional costs lose market share damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forego potential revenue opportunities for example in the quarter ended december 31 2017 we had high customer demand and certain component shortages which forced us to shorten transportation time from our factories in china by using air freight rather than less expensive ocean freight

 

we are dependent on ocean transportation to deliver our products in a cost efficient manner if we are unable to use ocean transportation to deliver our products our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted

 

we rely on commercial ocean transportation for the delivery of a large percentage of our products to our customers we also rely on more expensive air transportation when ocean transportation is not available or compatible with the delivery time requirements of our customers or when we are unable to meet the growing volume demands of our customers and need to accelerate delivery times our ability to deliver our products via ocean transportation could be adversely impacted by shortages in available cargo capacity changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling pricing payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel taxes and labor and other factors such as labor strikes and work stoppages not within our control if we are unable to use ocean transportation and are required to substitute more expensive air transportation our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted

 

we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers

 

we do not yet have internal manufacturing capabilities and currently rely upon our contract manufacturers to build all of our products one of our contract manufacturers is in the process of ramping up manufacturing during this period we mainly rely on one contract manufacturer any change in our relationship with our contract manufacturers or changes to contractual terms of our agreements with the contract manufacturers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs

 

the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues as a result fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner in addition the facilities in which our products are manufactured are located outside of the us currently in china romania and hungary the location of these facilities outside of key markets such as the us increases shipping time thereby causing a long lead time between manufacturing and delivery

 

if any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers an alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms including price any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers or increase our shipping costs to make up for delays in manufacturing which in turn could reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers and damage our reputation with local installers and potential endusers and cause us to forego potential revenue opportunities

 

we may experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations

 

our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise such processes involve a number of precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched identified and properly addressed and rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques andor expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased warranty reserve increased production and logistical costs and delays any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for key components and raw materials in our products to adequately meet anticipated demand due to the limited number of such suppliers any cessation of operations or production or any shortage delay price change imposition of tariffs or duties or other limitation on our ability to obtain the components and raw materials we use could result in sales delays higher costs associated with air shipments cancellations and loss of market share

 

we depend on limited or single source suppliers for certain key components and raw materials used to manufacture our products making us susceptible to quality issues shortages and price changes any of these limited or single source suppliers could stop producing our components or supplying our raw materials cease operations or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with one or more of our competitors as a result these suppliers could stop selling to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all because there are a limited number of suppliers of solar pv system components and raw materials used to manufacture our products it may be difficult to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative components or raw materials on commercially reasonable terms and our ability to satisfy customer demand may be adversely affected transitioning to a new supplier or redesigning a product to accommodate a new component manufacturer would result in additional costs and delays these outcomes could harm our business or financial performance

 

managing our supplier and contractor relationships is particularly difficult when we are introducing new products and when demand for our products is increasing especially if demand increases more quickly than we expect

any interruption in the supply of limited source components or raw materials for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers could result in lost revenue or higher expenses associated with increased air shipments required to meet customer demand in a timely manner and would harm our business

 

failure by our contract manufacturers or our component or raw material suppliers to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations may adversely affect our business

 

we do not control our contract manufacturers or suppliers or their business practices accordingly we cannot guarantee that they follow ethical business practices such as fair wage practices and compliance with environmental safety and other local laws a lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative manufacturers or suppliers which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products product shortages or other disruptions of our operations violation of labor or other laws by our manufacturers or suppliers or the divergence of a supplier’s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the us or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and harm our business

 

our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter which could make our future performance difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations for a particular period to fall below expectations resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock

 

our quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the future we have experienced seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in the past as a result of seasonal fluctuations in our customers’ business for example our customers’ and endusers’ ability to install solar energy systems is affected by weather as for example during the winter months in europe and the northeastern us such installation delays can impact the timing of orders for our products further given that we are operating in an industry that is affected by fluctuations as a result of economic factors such as tariff changes the true extent of these fluctuations may have been masked by our recent growth rates and consequently may not be readily apparent from our historical results of operations and may be difficult to predict our financial performance sales working capital requirements and cash flow may fluctuate and our past quarterly results of operations may not be good indicators of future performance any substantial decrease in revenues would have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price

 

we rely on distributors and large installers to assist in selling our products and the failure of these customers to perform as expected could reduce our future revenue

 

we currently sell a substantial percentage of our products through distributors who in turn sell to local installers and through direct sales to large installers we do not have exclusive arrangements with these third party distributors and large installers many of our distributors also market and sell products from our competitors and all of our large installer customers also use products from our competitors these distributors and large installers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and with little or no notice further these distributors and large installers may fail to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors termination of agreements with current distributors or large installers failure by these distributors or large installers to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new distributor or large installer relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and results of operations

 

the loss of one or more members of our senior management team or other key personnel or our failure to attract additional qualified personnel may adversely affect our business and our ability to achieve our anticipated level of growth

 

we depend on the continued services of our senior management team including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and other key personnel each of whom would be difficult to replace the loss of any such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to implement our business strategy all of our employees including our senior management are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time we do not maintain keyperson insurance for any of our employees including senior management

 

additionally our ability to attract qualified personnel including senior management and key technical personnel is critical to the execution of our growth strategy competition for qualified senior management personnel and highly skilled individuals with technical expertise is extremely intense and we face challenges identifying hiring and retaining qualified personnel in all areas of our business in addition integrating new employees into our team could prove disruptive to our operations require substantial resources and management attention and ultimately prove unsuccessful our failure to attract and retain qualified senior management and other key technical personnel could limit or delay our strategic efforts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects

 

if we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our business and results of operations could be materially harmed

 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and unfair competition laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we have applied for patents in the us europe and china some of which have been issued we cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology and any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to among other things rebrand or redesign our affected products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the us we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated infringed or otherwise violated

 

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert management’s attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate

 

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry from time to time we may also be subject to claims of intellectual property right infringement and related litigation and if we gain greater recognition in the market we face a higher risk of being the subject of claims that we have violated others’ intellectual property rights regardless of their merit responding to such claims can be time consuming can divert management’s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses in litigation or settlement while we believe that our products and technology do not infringe in any material respect upon any valid intellectual property rights of third parties we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims if we do not successfully defend or settle an intellectual property claim we could be liable for significant monetary damages and could be prohibited from continuing to use certain technology business methods content or brands to avoid a prohibition we could seek a license from the applicable third party which could require us to pay significant royalties increasing our operating expenses if a license is not available at all or not available on reasonable terms we may be required to develop or license a nonviolating alternative either of which could require significant effort and expense if we cannot license or develop a nonviolating alternative we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our offerings and may be unable to effectively compete any of these results would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees which could result in litigation and adversely affect our business

 

we enter into agreements with our employees pursuant to which they agree that any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement are assigned to us or owned exclusively by us depending on the jurisdiction without the employee retaining any rights a significant portion of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees in the course of their employment for us under the israeli patent law 57271967 the “patent law” inventions conceived by an employee during the scope of his or her employment with a company are regarded as “service inventions” which belong to the employer absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer giving the employee service invention rights the patent law also provides that if there is no such agreement between an employer and an employee the israeli compensation and royalties committee the “committee” a body constituted under the patent law shall determine whether the employee is entitled to remuneration for his or her inventions recent decisions by the committee and the israeli supreme court have created uncertainty in this area as the israeli supreme court held that employees may be entitled to remuneration for their service inventions despite having specifically waived any such rights further the committee has not yet determined the method for calculating this committeeenforced remuneration although our employees have agreed that any rights related to their inventions are owned exclusively by us we may face claims demanding remuneration in consideration for such acknowledgement as a consequence of such claims we could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to our current andor former employees or be forced to litigate such claims which could negatively affect our business

 

the loss of or events affecting one of our major customers could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

for the year ended december 31 2017 three of our major customers accounted for 299 of our revenues our next five largest customers for the year ended december 31 2017 together accounted for 233 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 our largest customer was consolidated electrical distributors inc ced accounting for 148 of our revenues our customers’ decisions to purchase our products are influenced by a number of factors outside of our control including retail energy prices and government regulation and incentives among others in addition these customers may decide to no longer use our products and services for other reasons which may be out of our control although we have agreements with some of our largest customers these agreements do not have longterm purchase commitments and are generally terminable by either party after a relatively short notice period the loss of or events affecting one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example in april 2017 one of our customers sungevity filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy laws

consolidations in the solar industry among our current or potential customers or distributors may adversely affect our competitive position    

there has been an increase in consolidation activity among distributors large installers and other strategic partners in the solar industry for example in july 2015 sunedison suneq announced its intention to purchase vivint solar for 2 billion in march 2016 vivint solar announced it was terminating the merger due to sunedison’s “willful breach of the merger agreement” in june 2016 tesla motors tsla announced that it had submitted a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of solarcity corporation scty this trend could further increase our reliance on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales and may negatively impact our competitive position in the solar market

our planned expansion into new geographic markets or new product lines or services could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks

 

in the year ended december 31 2017 we sold our products to approximately 230 direct customers in 48 countries including the us canada belgium france germany israel italy the netherlands the united kingdom australia japan and china we have in the past and may in the future evaluate opportunities to expand into new geographic markets and introduce new product offerings and services that are a natural extension of our existing business we also may from time to time engage in acquisitions of businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our market position enable us to enter attractive markets expand our technological capabilities or provide synergy opportunities for example we intend to continue introduce new products targeted at large commercial and utilityscale installations and to continue to expand into other international markets

our success operating in these new geographic or product markets or in operating any acquired business will depend on a number of factors including our ability to develop solutions to address the requirements of the large commercial and utilityscale solar pv markets timely qualification and certification of new products for large commercial and utilityscale solar pv installations acceptance of power optimizers in solar pv markets in which they have not traditionally been used our ability to manage increased manufacturing capacity and production and our ability to identify and integrate any acquired businesses

 

further we expect these new solar pv markets to have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products and our success will depend on our ability to adapt properly to these differences these differences may include differing regulatory requirements including tax laws trade laws labor regulations tariffs export quotas customs duties or other trade restrictions limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection international political or economic conditions restrictions on the repatriation of earnings longer sales cycles warranty expectations product return policies and cost performance and compatibility requirements in addition expanding into new geographic markets will increase our exposure to presently existing risks such as fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and difficulties and increased expenses in complying with us and foreign laws regulations and trade standards including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa”

 

failure to develop and introduce these new products successfully or to otherwise manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to sustain profitability

 

if we fail to manage our recent and future growth effectively we may be unable to execute our business plan maintain high levels of customer service or adequately address competitive challenges

 

we have experienced significant growth in recent periods with our annual product sales growing rapidly from approximately 8400 inverters and approximately 181000 power optimizers in fiscal 2011 the period beginning july 1 2010 and ending june 30 2011 our first full fiscal year of commercial shipments to annual product sales exceeding 316000 inverters and 73 million power optimizers in the year ended december 31 2017 we intend to continue to expand our business significantly within existing and new markets this growth has placed and any future growth may place a significant strain on our management operational and financial infrastructure in particular we will be required to expand train and manage our growing employee base and scale and otherwise improve our it infrastructure in tandem with that headcount growth our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers as well as manage multiple geographic locations

 

our current and planned operations personnel it information systems and other systems and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth and may require us to make additional unanticipated investment in our infrastructure our success and ability to further scale our business will depend in part on our ability to manage these changes in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot manage our growth we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures this could also result in declines in quality or customer satisfaction increased costs difficulties in introducing new offerings or other operational difficulties any failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our business and reputation

 

  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

 

although our financial results are reported in us dollars 374 of our revenues in the year ended december 31 2017 were generated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition a significant portion of our operating expenses are accrued in new israeli shekels primarily related to payroll and to a lesser extent the euro and other currencies our profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and to a lesser extent the new israeli shekel and other currencies in which we generate revenues incur expenses and maintain cash balances foreign currency fluctuations may also affect the prices of our products our prices are denominated primarily in us dollars if there is a significant devaluation of a particular currency the prices of our products will increase relative to the local currency and may be less competitive despite our efforts to minimize foreign currency risks primarily by entering into forwardhedging transactions to sell euro for us dollars at a predefined rate and maintaining cash balances in new israeli shekels significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values in particular a significant change in the relative values of the euro and to a lesser extent the new israeli shekel and other currencies against the us dollar could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition

 

  from time to time we enter into forward contracts to hedge the exchange impacts on assets and liabilities denominated in israeli shekels euros and other currencies as of december 31 2017 we entered into forward and put and call options contracts to sell euros for us dollars which did not meet the requirement for hedge accounting in the amount of €54 million we use derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts and put and call options to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on accounts receivable and forecast cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies we may not be able to purchase derivative instruments adequate to fully insulate ourselves from foreign currency exchange risks

 

  additionally our hedging activities may also contribute to increased losses as a result of volatility in foreign currency markets if foreign exchange currency markets continue to be volatile such fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations in future periods also the volatility in the foreign currency markets may make it difficult to hedge our foreign currency exposures effectively

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities

 

  the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain like many other multinational corporations we are subject to tax in multiple jurisdictions both in the us and outside the us our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable tax authorities any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could affect our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities these reserves may prove to be insufficient

 

  in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated or by the incurrence of losses in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items

 

  various levels of government such as us federal and state legislatures and international organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” and the european union are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax rate

any unauthorized access to or disclosure or theft of personal information we gather store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation

 

we receive store and use certain personal information of our customers and the endusers of our customers’ solar pv systems including names addresses email addresses credit information and energy production statistics we also store and use personal information of our employees we take steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the personal information we collect store and transmit but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we and our suppliers or vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures

 

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee or contractor error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information were to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws

 

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws however we currently operate in and intend to further expand into many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our entry into certain jurisdictions requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from us standards it is possible that our employees subcontractors agents and partners may take actions in violation of our policies and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us to criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation

third parties might attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network or seek to compromise our products and services

from time to time we face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology it systems additionally malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide we or our products may be a target of computer hackers organizations or malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products employees and customers or interrupt our systems or those of our customers or others from time to time we encounter intrusions or attempts at gaining unauthorized access to our network to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations while we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network and products and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools andor changes to our products we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats in addition to intentional thirdparty cybersecurity breaches the integrity and confidentiality of company and customer data may be compromised as a result of human error product defects or technological failures cybersecurity breaches whether successful or unsuccessful and other it system interruptions including those resulting from human error and technological failures could result in our incurring significant costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems reduced inventory value providing modifications to our products and services defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties 

 

risks related to operations in israel

 

conditions in israel affect our operations and may limit our ability to develop produce and sell our products

 

although we are incorporated in delaware our headquarters and research and development center are located in israel accordingly political economic and military conditions in israel directly affect us israel has been involved in a number of armed conflicts and has been the target of terrorist activity ongoing state of hostility varying in degree such as rocket fire from the gaza strip including against civilian targets has occurred on an irregular basis disrupting daytoday civilian activity and negatively affecting business conditions israel also faces threats from hezbollah militants in lebanon and others we cannot predict whether or when such armed conflicts or attacks may occur or the extent to which such events may impact us any future armed conflict political instability or violence in the region may impede our ability to manage our business effectively or to engage in research and development or may otherwise adversely affect our business or operations in the event of war we and our israeli subcontractors and suppliers may cease operations which may cause delays in the distribution and sale of our products some of our directors executive officers and employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and are subject to being called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances in the event that our principal executive office is damaged as a result of hostile action or hostilities otherwise disrupting the ongoing operation of our offices our ability to operate could be materially adversely affected

 

additionally several countries principally in the middle east restrict doing business with israeli companies and additional countries and groups may impose similar restrictions if hostilities in israel or political instability in the region continue or increase if recent regime changes and civil wars in neighboring states result in the establishment of fundamentalist islamic regimes or governments more hostile to israel or if egypt or jordan abrogates its respective peace treaty with israel israel could be subject to additional political economic and military confines and our operations and ability to sell our products to countries in the region could be materially adversely affected these restrictions may limit materially our ability to obtain manufactured components and raw materials or to sell our products

 

any hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners or significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

the tax benefits that are available to us under israeli law require us to meet various conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future which could increase our costs and taxes

 

our israeli subsidiary is eligible for certain tax benefits provided to “benefited enterprises” under the israeli law for the encouragement of capital investments 1959 the “investment law” in order to remain eligible for the tax benefits for “benefited enterprises” we must continue to meet certain conditions stipulated in the investment law and its regulations as amended if these tax benefits are reduced cancelled or discontinued our israeli taxable income would be subject to regular israeli corporate tax rates and we may be required to refund any tax benefits that we have already received plus interest and penalties thereon the standard corporate tax rate for israeli companies was increased to 265 in 2014 and 2015 decreased to 25 in 2016 and decreased again to 24 as of january 1 2017 and 23 as of january 1 2018 additionally if we increase our activities outside of israel through acquisitions for example our expanded activities might not be eligible for inclusion in future israeli tax benefit programs the israeli government may furthermore independently determine to reduce phase out or eliminate entirely the benefit programs under the investment law regardless of whether we then qualify for benefits under those programs at the time which would also adversely affect our global tax rate and our results of operations

 

it may be difficult to enforce a judgment of a us court against our officers and directors to assert us securities laws claims in israel or to serve process on our officers and directors

 

the majority of our directors and executive officers reside outside of the us and most of our assets and most of the assets of these persons are located outside of the us consequently a judgment obtained against any of these persons including a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws may not be collectible in the us it also may be difficult for you to effect service of process on these persons in the us or to assert us securities law claims in original actions instituted in israel israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of us securities laws on the grounds that israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim in addition even if an israeli court hears a claim it may determine that israeli law and not us law is applicable to the claim if us law is found to be applicable the content of applicable us law must be proven as a fact by expert witnesses which can be a time consuming and costly process further an israeli court may not enforce a judgment awarded by a us or other nonisraeli court certain matters of procedure will also be governed by israeli law there is little binding case law in israel that addresses these matters as a result of the difficulty associated with enforcing a judgment against any of these persons in israel you may not be able to obtain or enforce a judgment against many of our directors and executive officers

 

risks related to the ownership of our common stock

 

we cannot assure you that our stock price will not decline or not be subject to significant volatility

 

the trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in march 2015 at a price of 1800 per share during the year ended december 31 2017 the reported high and low prices of our common stock has ranged from 1225 to 399 per share the price of our stock may change in response to fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods and also may change in response to other factors including factors specific to companies in our industry many of which are beyond our control as a result our share price may experience significant volatility and may not necessarily reflect the value of our expected performance among other factors that could affect our stock price are

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    further the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies in addition the stock prices of many renewable energy companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial cost and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

 

the price of our common stock could decline if securities analysts or other third parties publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or if one or more of our analysts ceases to cover us or to regularly publish reports about us

 

the trading of our common stock is likely to be influenced by the reports and research that industry or securities analysts publish about us our business our market or our competitors if one or more securities or industry analysts downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price would likely decline if one or more securities or industry analysts ceases to cover the company or fails to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline

tableend 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the sections of this annual report on form 10k captioned “selected financial data” and “business” and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form 10k in addition to historical financial information the following discussion and analysis contains forward‑looking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward‑looking statements as a result of many factors including those discussed under the sections of this annual report captioned “special note regarding forward‑looking statements” and “risk factors”

 

overview

 

we are a leading provider of intelligent inverter solutions that are changing the way power is harvested and managed in solar pv systems our dc optimized inverter solution maximizes power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system our systems allow for superior power harvesting and module management by deploying power optimizers at each pv module while maintaining a competitive system cost by using a simplified dc‑ac inverter our systems are monitored through our cloud‑based monitoring platform that enables lower system operating and maintenance “om” costs we believe that these benefits along with our comprehensive and advanced safety features are highly valued by our customers

 

we are a leader in the global modulelevel power electronics “mlpe” market according to gtm research and as of december 31 2017 we have shipped approximately 227 million power optimizers and 950000 inverters more than 560000 installations many of which may include multiple inverters are currently connected to and monitored through our cloud‑based monitoring platform as of december 31 2017 we have shipped approximately 67 gw of our dc optimized inverter systems our products have sold in approximately 54 countries and are installed in solar pv systems in 121 countries

 

we primarily sell our products directly to large solar installers epcs and indirectly to thousands of smaller solar installers through large distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers our sales strategy focuses on top‑tier customers in markets where electricity prices irradiance amount of sunlight and government policies make solar pv installations economically viable we also sell our power optimizers to several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules

 

in the year ended december 31 2017 we sold our products to approximately 230 direct customers in 48 countries and as of december 31 2017 approximately 355000 indirect customers had registered with us through our cloud‑based monitoring platform in the year ended december 31 2017 one customer accounted for revenues of above 10 and our top three customers all distributors together represented 299 of our revenues

 

we were founded in 2006 with the goal of addressing the lost power generation potential that is inherent in the use of traditional solar pv inverter technology thereby increasing the return on investment in solar pv systems the following is a chronology of some of our key milestones

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our revenues were 3251 million 4898 million 2400 million and 6070 million for fiscal 2015 and 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 and fiscal 2017 respectively gross margins were 252  310 337 and 354  for fiscal 2015 and 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 and fiscal 2017 respectively net profits were 211 million 766 million 254 million and 842 million for fiscal 2015 and 2016 for the six months ended december 31 2016 and fiscal 2017 respectively

 

we continue to focus on our long‑term growth and profitability we believe that our market opportunity is large and that the transition from traditional inverter architecture to dc optimized inverter architecture will continue as the architecture of choice for distributed solar installations globally we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this market trend we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to acquire new customers in our existing markets grow internationally and drive additional revenue we also plan to expand our product offerings to further penetrate the large commercial and utility segments we expect to continue to invest in research and development to enhance our product offerings and develop new costeffective solutions

 

we believe that our strategy results in an efficient operating base with relatively low expenses that will enable profitability on lower revenues relative to our competitors we believe that our sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long‑term as we continue to grow due to economies of scale with this increased operating leverage we expect our gross and operating margins to increase in the long‑term we believe that it is too early to estimate the impact if any the newly adopted us tariff imposed on all imported solar modules and cells may have on the price of solar systems in the united states if the price of solar systems in the us increases it may reduce the number of solar systems manufactured and sold which in turn may decrease demand for our products

 

performance measures

 

in managing our business and assessing financial performance we supplement the information provided by the financial statements with other operating metrics these operating metrics are utilized by our management to evaluate our business measure our performance identify trends affecting our business and formulate projections we use metrics relating to yearly shipments inverters shipped power optimizers shipped and megawatts shipped to evaluate our sales performance and to track market acceptance of our products from year to year we use metrics relating to monitoring systems monitored and megawatts monitored to evaluate market acceptance of our products and usage of our solution

 

we provide the “megawatts shipped” metric which is calculated based on nameplate capacity shipped to show adoption of our system on a nameplate capacity basis nameplate capacity shipped is the maximum rated power output capacity of an inverter and corresponds to our financial results in that higher total capacities shipped are generally associated with higher total revenues however revenues increase with each additional unit not necessarily each additional mw of capacity sold accordingly we also provide the “inverters shipped” and “power optimizers shipped” operating metrics

 

key components of our results of operations

 

the following discussion describes certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations

 

revenues

 

we generate revenues from the sale of dc optimized inverter systems for solar pv installations which include power optimizers inverters and our cloud‑based monitoring platform our customer base includes distributors large solar installers wholesalers epcs and pv module manufacturers

 

our revenues are affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our dc optimized inverter systems the volume and average selling price of our systems is driven by the supply and demand for our products changes in the product mix between our residential and commercial products the customer mix between large and small customers the geographical mix of our sales sales incentives end‑user government incentives seasonality and competitive product offerings

 

our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to expand our market share in each of the geographies in which we compete expand our global footprint to new evolving markets grow our production capabilities to meet demand and to continue to develop and introduce new and innovative products that address the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers

 

cost of revenues and gross profit

 

cost of revenues consists primarily of product costs including purchases from our contract manufacturers and other suppliers as well as costs related to shipping customer support product warranty personnel depreciation of test and manufacturing equipment hosting services for our cloud‑based monitoring platform and other logistics services our product costs are affected by technological innovations such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions economies of scale resulting in lower component costs and improvements in production processes and automation some of these costs primarily personnel and depreciation of test and manufacturing equipment are not directly affected by sales volume

 

we outsource our manufacturing to third‑party manufacturers and negotiate product pricing on a quarterly basis our third‑party manufacturers are responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products except with regard to endofline testing equipment and the automated assembly lines for our power optimizers as further described below which resulted in capital expenditures of 52 million 14 million and 136 million for fiscal 2016 for the six months ended december 31 2016 and fiscal 2017 respectively we expect to continue this funding arrangement in the future with respect to any expansions to such existing lines we also procure strategic and critical components from various approved vendors on behalf of our contract manufacturers at times higher than anticipated demand has exceeded the production capacities of these manufacturers in 2014 and early 2015 for example such production shortfalls as well as shortages in the supply of certain raw materials required us to use air freight rather than less expensive ocean freight to deliver the majority of our products the expansion of current manufacturing sites by our contract manufacturers allowed us to reduce these expenses in fiscal 2015 as well as to build sufficient inventory to continue our growth without the need to ship substantial amounts of products by air in 2016 we managed to continuously increase the efficiency of our supply chain reduce our reliance on air freight to a minimum and use ocean freight for the majority of our shipments

 

in 2017 global shortages in power components used in our products and in other industries such as electrical motor drives and uninterrupted power systems ups caused delays in our ongoing manufacturing this phenomenon combined with increased demand for our products required us use expensive air shipments in order to meet our delivery schedule which negatively affected our gross profit we expect component shortages to continue to affect us in upcoming quarters a combination of increased component safety stocks qualification of additional suppliers and increased capacity of our existing vendors coupled with continued expansion of the current manufacturing sites by our contract manufacturers and the development and deployment of our proprietary automated assembly line described below will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our forecasted demands with lower shipment volumes of products by air freight

 

we completed development of our first proprietary automated assembly line for our power optimizers and had 3 additional automated assembly lines deployed in the first half of 2017 we expect to continue to invest in additional automated assembly lines in the future we have designed and are responsible for funding all of the capital expenses associated with existing and future automated assembly lines the current and expected capital expenses associated with these automated assembly lines will be funded out of our cash flows

 

key components of our logistics supply channel consist of third party distribution centers in the us europe australia and japan finished goods are either shipped to our customers directly from our contract manufacturers or shipped to thirdparty distribution centers and then finally shipped to our customers

 

cost of revenues also includes our operations and support departments’ costs the operations department is responsible for production management such as planning procurement supply chain production methodologies and machinery planning logistics management and manufacturing support to our contract manufacturers as well as the quality assurance of our products our support department provides customer and technical support at various levels through our call centers around the world as well as second and thirdlevel support services which are provided by support personnel located in our headquarters our full‑time employee headcount in our operations and support departments has grown from 106 as of june 30 2015 to 175 as of june 30 2016 to 244 as of december 31 2016 and to 348 as of december 31 2017

 

gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices product costs product mix customer mix geographical mix shipping method warranty costs and seasonality

 

operating expenses

 

operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnel‑related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories and include salaries benefits payroll taxes commissions and stock‑based compensation our full‑time employee headcount in our research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative departments has grown from 334 as of june 30 2015 to 434 as of june 30 2016 to 475 as of december 31 2016 and to 660 as of december 31 2017 we expect to continue to hire significant numbers of new employees to support our growth the timing of these additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses in any particular period both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue we expect to continue to invest substantial resources to support our growth and anticipate that each of the following categories of operating expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts for the foreseeable future

 

research and development expenses net

 

research and development expenses net include personnel‑related expenses such as salaries benefits stock‑based compensation and payroll taxes our research and development employees are engaged in the design and development of power electronics semiconductors software and power line communications and networking our research and development expenses also include third‑party design and consulting costs materials for testing and evaluation asic development and licensing costs depreciation expense and other indirect costs we devote substantial resources to ongoing research and development programs that focus on enhancements to and cost efficiencies in our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation thereby maintaining our competitive position

 

research and development expenses are presented net of the amount of any grants we receive for research and development in the period in which we receive the grant we previously received grants and other funding from the binational industrial research and development foundation and the israel innovation authority the iia certain of those grants required us to pay royalties on sales of certain of our products which were recorded as cost of revenues as of december 31 2017 no such royalty obligations remained

 

sales and marketing expenses

 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel‑related expenses such as salaries sales commissions benefits payroll taxes and stock‑based compensation these expenses also include travel fees of independent consultants trade shows marketing costs associated with the operation of our sales offices and other indirect costs the expected increase in sales and marketing expenses is due to an expected increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel and the expansion of our global sales and marketing footprint enabling us to increase our penetration of new markets while most of our sales in fiscal 2012 the period beginning july 1 2011 and ending june 30 2012 were in europe sales in the us have grown steadily since fiscal 2012 revenues generated in the us represented 682  668  and 575  of our revenues in fiscal 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 and fiscal 2017 respectively sales in europe which represented most of our sales until fiscal 2013 the period beginning july 1 2012 and ending june 30 2013 also increased and represented 227  252  and 327  of our revenues in fiscal 2016 in the six months ended december 31 2016 and in fiscal 2017 respectively we currently have a sales presence in the us canada france germany italy the netherlands the united kingdom israel turkey japan australia china sweden poland india and belgium we intend to continue to expand our sales presence to additional countries

 

general and administrative expenses

 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits payroll taxes and stock‑based compensation related to our executives finance human resources information technology and legal organizations travel expenses facilities costs fees for professional services and registration fees related to being a publiclytraded company professional services consist of audit and legal costs remuneration to board members tax insurance information technology and other costs general and administrative expenses also include allowance for doubtful accounts in the event of uncollectable account receivables balances

 

non‑operating expenses

 

financial income expenses

 

financial income expenses consists primarily of interest income interest expense gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations and hedging transactions and gains or losses related to re‑measurement of warrants granted in relation to long‑term debt incurred by the company in december 2012

 

interest income consists of interest from our investment in available for sale marketable securities

 

interest expense consists of interest and other charges paid to silicon valley bank “svb” in connection with our revolving line of credit which expired on december 31 2016 and interest on our term loan from kreos which was fully repaid on january 26 2015 both described below

 

gains or losses related to re‑measurement of warrants granted in relation to long‑term debt incurred by the company in december 2012 are not expected to occur in the future as the warrants were fully exercised on june 18 2015

 

our functional currency is the us dollar with respect to certain of our subsidiaries the functional currency is the applicable local currency financial expenses net is net of financial income which consists primarily of the effect of foreign exchange differences between the us dollar and the new israeli shekel the euro and other currencies related to our monetary assets and liabilities and the realization of gain from hedging transactions

 

taxes on income

 

we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we operate

 

from incorporation through the end of fiscal 2014 we experienced operating losses and consequently accumulated a significant amount of operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions by the end of fiscal 2015 we fully utilized our unused operating loss carryforwards with respect to us federal tax obligations in fiscal 2016 we recorded net income tax expenses of 04 million for federal and state tax in the us which consisted of 18 million current income tax expenses and 14 million deferred tax assets in the six months ended december 31 2016 we recorded net income tax expenses of 16 million for federal and state tax in the us which consisted of 11 million current income tax expenses and 05 million deferred tax liabilities in fiscal 2017 we recorded net income tax expenses of 198 million for federal and state tax in the us which consists of 199 million current income tax expenses and 01 million deferred tax

 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tcja” was signed into law making significant changes to the us income tax law changes include but are not limited to a corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 we have estimated our provision for income taxes in accordance with the tcja and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded 192 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 the period in which the legislation was enacted the provisional amount related to the r emeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future resulted in 05 million of additional expense the provisional amount related to t he onetime transition tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings resulted in 187 million of additional expense based on cumulative foreign earnings of 1450 million

 

we have determined that the 05 million of the deferred tax expense recorded in connection with the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and the 187 million of current tax expense recorded in connection with the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was a provisional amount and a reasonable estimate as of december 31 2017 additional work is necessary for a more detailed analysis of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our historical foreign earnings as well as potential correlative adjustments any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete

 

additionally the tcja requires certain global intangible low taxed income “gilti” earned by controlled foreign corporations “cfcs” to be included in the gross income of the cfcs’ us shareholder gaap allows the company to either i treat taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or ii factor such amounts into its measurement of deferred taxes the “deferred method” the gilti tax rules will become effective for the 2018 tax year and therefore the company has not made any adjustments related to the potential gilti tax in its financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 the company continues to evaluate the impact of the new gilti tax rules and the application of asc 740 on its financial statements

 

solaredge technologies ltd our israeli subsidiary is taxed under israeli law income not eligible for benefits under the investment law is taxed at the corporate tax rate the corporate tax rate in israel was 265 in fiscal 2015 and 25 in fiscal 2016 recent amendments of the israeli income tax ordinance decreased the corporate tax rate to 25 commencing on january 1 2016 24 starting january 1 2017 and 23 starting january 1 2018 however our israeli subsidiary elected tax year 2012 as a year of election for “beneficiary enterprise” under the israeli investment law which provides certain benefits including tax exemptions and reduced tax rates income not eligible for beneficiary enterprise benefits is taxed at the then prevailing regular corporate tax rate upon meeting the requirements under the israeli investment law income derived from productive activity under the beneficiary enterprise status will be exempt from tax for two years from the year in which the israeli subsidiary first generated taxable income provided that 12 years have not passed from the beginning of the year of election because solaredge technologies ltd used all of its losses carryforwards in the six months ended in december 31 2016 the twoyear tax exemption is expected to end on june 30 2018 capital gains derived by an israeli company are subject to tax at the prevailing corporate tax rate

 

in december 2016 the economic efficiency law 2016 legislative amendments for applying the economic policy for the 2017 and 2018 budget years which includes amendment 73 to the law for the encouragement of capital investments the 2017 amendment was published according to the 2017 amendment a preferred enterprise located in development area a as defined therein and which details specific areas in development in israel will be subject to a tax rate of 75 instead of 9 effective from january 1 2017 and thereafter the tax rate applicable to preferred enterprises located in other areas remains at 16

the amendment also prescribes special tax tracks for technological enterprises which are subject to rules that were issued by the ministry of finance in such rules a “technological preferred enterprise refers to an enterprise whose total consolidated revenues of its parent company and all subsidiaries are less than nis 10 billion a technological preferred enterprise as defined in the 2017 amendment that is located in the central region of israel will be subject to tax at a rate of 12 on profits deriving from intellectual property in development area a  a tax rate of 75 solaredge technologies ltd will be entitled to an effective tax at a rate of 1402 under the 2017 amendment

revenues

 

  

revenues increased by 1648 million or 507 in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to an increase in the number of systems sold worldwide with the us being the largest market the number of power optimizers sold increased by approximately 22 million units or 621 from approximately 35 million units in fiscal 2015 to approximately 57 million units in fiscal 2016 the number of inverters sold increased by approximately 72000 units or 474 from approximately 152000 units in fiscal 2015 to approximately 224000 units in fiscal 2016 the increase in the number of units sold was mainly attributable to an increase in the number of systems sold in the us market and certain countries in europe in general our increase in revenues in fiscal 2016 was attributable to rapid expansion in the us market our blended average selling price per watt for units shipped decreased by 0048 or 135 in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increased sales of our commercial products which are characterized with lower average selling price per watt and a change in our customer mix which included larger portion of sales to distribution channels and large customers to whom we provide volume discounts

 

cost of revenues and gross profit

 

  

cost of revenues increased by 946 million or 389 in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to i an increase in the volume of products sold ii an increase in personnelrelated costs resulting from an increase in our operations and support headcount iii increased warranty expenses associated with the increase in our install base and iv an inventory writeoff of 10 million related to unrecognized revenues from a customer that filed for bankruptcy these increases were offset by reductions derived from increased efficiency in our supply chain including a decrease in shipping costs associated with the minimal use of air freight gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from 252 fiscal 2015 to 310 in fiscal 2016 primarily due to reductions in per unit production costs cost increased efficiency in our supply chain including the use of more ocean freight shipments rather than air shipments lower costs associated with warranty product replacements and general economies of scale in our personnelrelated costs and other costs associated with our support and operations departments

debt obligations

 

we had no outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2016 and 2017 in fiscal 2015 we financed our business in part through debt financing as described below

 

40 million revolving line of credit

 

in february 2015 we amended and restated an agreement with svb for a revolving line of credit which permits aggregate borrowings of up to 40 million in an amount not to exceed 80 of the eligible accounts receivable and bears interest payable monthly at svb’s prime rate plus a margin of 05 to 20 the revolving line of credit terminated on december 31 2016 and we had not made borrowings under this revolving line of credit with svb

 

term loan

 

on december 28 2012 we entered into a term loan agreement with kreos providing for a term loan of up to 10 million which was fully drawn on the closing date the borrowings under the term loan were primarily used to finance working capital needs on january 26 2015 we repaid the entire outstanding balance of the kreos term loan

 

interest on the term loan was payable monthly at a rate of 1190 per year compounded on a monthly basis principal was paid in 33 equal monthly installments from september 1 2013 through may 1 2016 the last of which was prepaid in advance pursuant to the terms of the term loan

contractual obligations

 

the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december 31 2017

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

off‑balance sheet arrangements

 

we did not have any off‑balance sheet arrangements in fiscal 2015 fiscal 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 or the year ended december 31 2017

 

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates

 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “gaap” the preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain

 

revenue recognition

 

we generate revenues from the sale of dc optimized inverter systems for solar pv installations which include our power optimizers inverters and cloud‑based monitoring platform our worldwide customer base includes large solar installers distributors epcs and pv module manufacturers our products are fully functional at the time of shipment to the customer and do not require production modification or customization we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred iii the price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured provisions for rebates sales incentives and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded

 

we generally sell our products to our customers pursuant to a customer’s standard purchase order and our customary terms and conditions we do not offer rights to return our products other than for normal warranty conditions and as such revenue is recorded upon shipment of products to customers and transfer of title and risk of loss under standard commercial terms we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine that appropriate credit limits are established prior to the acceptance and shipment of an order

 

we provide our full web‑based monitoring platform free of charge and revenues associated with the service since that date are being recognized ratably over 25 years in the absence of vendor‑specific objective evidence or third party comparable pricing for such service management determines the revenue levels of this service based on the costs associated with providing the service plus appropriate margins that reflect management’s best estimate of the selling price since may 2013 these revenues were minimal and we do not expect this to become a significant source of revenue in the near future

 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued a new standard related to revenue recognition under the new standard revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services in addition the standard requires disclosure of the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers the guidance permits two methods of modification  retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented full retrospective method or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application the cumulative catchup transition method we will adopt the new standard as of january 1 2018 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not substantially completed as of january 1 2018 the cumulative adjustment will decrease the company’s retained earnings by 3875 while increasing the company’s deferred revenues by the same amount

 

the most significant impact of the standard on the company’s financial statements relates to advance payments received for performance obligations that extend for a period longer than one year applying the new standard such performance obligations relate to warranty extensions cloudbased monitoring and other communication services

 

upon adoption the financing component will result in interest expenses which will be included in the company consolidated statement of operations to reflect the financial portion cost of the long term deferred revenue that is related to services

 

product warranty

 

we provide a standard limited product warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions our standard warranty period is 25 years for our power optimizers 12 years for our inverters and 10 years for our storage interface in certain cases customers can purchase extended warranties for inverters that increase the warranty period to up to 25 years

 

our products are designed to meet the warranty periods and our reliability procedures cover component selection design accelerated life cycle tests and endofmanufacturing line testing however since our history in selling power optimizers and inverters is substantially shorter than the warranty period the calculation of warranty provisions is inherently uncertain

 

we accrue for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based on anticipated warranty claims and actual historical warranty claims experience warranty provisions computed on a per‑unit sold basis are based on our best estimate of such costs and are included in our cost of revenues the warranty obligation is determined based on actual and predicted failure rates of the products cost of replacement and service and delivery costs incurred to correct a product failure our warranty obligation requires management to make assumptions regarding estimated failure rates and replacement costs

 

in order to predict the failure rate of each of our products we have established a reliability model based on the estimated mean time between failures “mtbf” the mtbf represents the average elapsed time predicted for each product unit between failures during operation applying the mtbf failure rate over our install base for each product type and generation allows us to predict the number of failed units over the warranty period and estimates the costs associated with the product warranty predicted failure rates are updated periodically based on data returned from the field and new product versions as are replacement costs which are updated to reflect changes in our actual production costs for our products subcontractors’ labor costs and actual logistics costs

 

since the mtbf model does not take into account additional non‑systematic failures such as failures caused by workmanship or manufacturing or design‑related issues and since warranty claims are at times opened for cases in which the error has been triggered by an improper installation we have developed a supplemental model to predict such cases and recognize the associated expenses ratably over the expected claim period this model which is based on actual root cause analysis of returned products identification of the causes of claims and time until each identified problem is revealed allows us to better predict actual warranty expenses and is updated periodically based on our experience taking into account the installed base of approximately 227 million power optimizers and approximately 948000 inverters as of december 31 2017

 

if actual warranty costs differ significantly from these estimates adjustments may be required in the future which could adversely affect our gross profit and results of operations warranty obligations are classified as shortterm and longterm warranty obligations based on the period in which the warranty is expected to be claimed the warranty provision short and longterm was 512 million in fiscal 2016 584 million as of december 31 2016 and 788 million as of december 31 2017

 

inventory valuation

 

our inventories comprise sellable finished goods raw materials bought on behalf of our contract manufacturers and faulty units returned under our warranty policy

 

sellable finished goods and raw material inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based on the moving average cost method certain factors could affect the realizable value of our inventories including market and economic conditions technological changes existing product changes mainly due to cost reduction activities and new product introductions we consider historic usage expected demand anticipated sales price the effect of new product introductions product obsolescence product merchantability and other factors when evaluating the value of inventories inventory write‑downs are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and their estimated fair market value inventory write‑downs are recorded as cost of revenues in the accompanying statements of operations and were 25 million 01 million and 14 million in fiscal 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 and in the year ended december 31 2017 respectively

 

faulty products returned under our warranty policy are often refurbished and used as replacement units in warranty cases such products are written off upon receipt

 

we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions that we use to record inventory at the lower of cost or market however if estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner we may be exposed to losses that could be material

 

stock‑based compensation expense

 

we account for stock‑based compensation granted to employees non‑employee directors and independent contractors in accordance with asc 718 “compensation — stock compensation” and asc 505‑50 “equity‑based payments to non‑employees” which require the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock‑based payment awards based on fair value

 

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the black‑scholes‑merton option‑pricing model the stock‑based compensation expense net of forfeitures is recognized using a straight‑line basis over the requisite service period of the award which is generally four years estimated forfeitures are based on actual historical pre‑vesting forfeitures

 

we recognize compensation expenses for the value of its restricted stock unit “rsu” awards based on the straightline method over the requisite service period of each of the awards net of estimated forfeitures the fair value of each rsu is the market value as determined by the closing price of the common stock on the day of grant 

 

key assumptions

 

the black‑scholes‑merton option‑pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the fair value of the underlying common stock the expected volatility of the price of our common stock the expected term of the option risk‑free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment if factors change and different assumptions are used our stock‑based compensation expense could be materially different in the future these assumptions are estimated as follows

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of the assumptions used in the black‑scholes‑merton model change significantly future stock‑based compensation awards for employees may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously

 

the following table presents the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted to employees during the periods presented

  

during fiscal 2015 and 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 and the year ended december 2017 we incurred non‑cash stock‑based compensation and employee stock purchase plan expenses of 2956000 9089000 6600000 and 17564000 respectively we expect to continue to grant stockbased awards in the future and to the extent that we do our actual share‑based compensation expense for employees and consultants recognized will likely increase

 

income taxes

 

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 “income taxes” asc 740 which prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse

 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc 740 asc 74010 contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that on an evaluation of the technical merits the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 cumulative probability likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend 

 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates customer concentrations and interest rates we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes

 

foreign currency exchange risk

 

approximately 218 240 277 and 374 of our revenues for fiscal 2015 fiscal 2016 the six months ended december 31 2016 and the year ended december 31 2017 respectively were earned in non‑us dollar denominated currencies principally the euro our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located primarily the us dollar and new israeli shekel and to a lesser extent the euro our new israeli shekel‑denominated expenses consist primarily of personnel and overhead costs our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 177 million for the year ended december 31 2017 a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the new israeli shekel and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 71 million for the year ended december 31 2017

 

for purposes of our consolidated financial statements local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the us dollar on the balance sheet date and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rate as of the date of the transaction or at the average exchange rate to the us dollar during the reporting period

 

to date we have used derivative financial instruments specifically foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign currency risks by hedging a portion of our account receivable balances denominated in euros expected to be paid within six months our foreign currency forward contracts are expected to mitigate exchange rate changes related to the hedged assets we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes

 

we had cash and cash equivalents of 1448 million 740 million 1047 million and 1632 million at the end of fiscal 2015 2016 december 31 2016 and as of december 31 2017 respectively which was held for working capital purposes in addition we had availableforsale marketable securities with an estimated fair value of  1116 million 1187 million and  1804 million on june 30 2016 december 31 2016 and december 31 2017 respectively

 

we entered into forward contracts and put and call options to hedge the exchange impacts on assets and liabilities denominated in other than the us dollar as of december 31 2017 we had outstanding forward contracts and put and call options to sell euros for us dollars in the amount of €54 million that did not meet the requirement for hedge accounting we use derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on accounts receivable and forecast cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies we may not be able to purchase derivative instruments adequate to fully insulate ourselves from foreign currency exchange risks and over the past year we have incurred losses as a result of exchange rate fluctuations on exposures that have not been covered by our hedging strategy

 

additionally our hedging activities may also contribute to increased losses as a result of volatility in foreign currency markets if foreign exchange currency markets continue to be volatile such fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations in future periods also the volatility in the foreign currency markets may make it difficult to hedge our foreign currency exposures effectively

 

concentrations of major customers

 

our trade accounts receivables potentially expose us to a concentration of credit risk with our major customers for the year ended december 31 2017 one major customer accounted for 148 of total revenues and as of december 31 2017 two major customers accounted for approximately 352 of our consolidated trade receivables balance we currently do not foresee a credit risk associated with these receivables in fiscal 2016 three major customers accounted for 325 of our total revenues in the six months ended december 31 2016 one major customer accounted for 112 of our total revenues

 

inflation

 

we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the last three years if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

 

commodity price risk

 

we are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials including copper which are used in our products prices of these raw materials may be affected by supply restrictions or other market factors from time to time and we do not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate commodity risk significant price changes for these raw materials could reduce our operating margins if we are unable to recover such increases from our customers and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017 the end of our 2017 year management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework management’s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment

 

based on this assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors

 

our independent registered public accounting firm kost forer gabbay  kasierer a member of ernst  young independently assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in the firm’s attestation report which is incorporated by reference into part ii item 8 of this form 10k

 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how welldesigned and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

changes in internal control over financial reporting

 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

introduction

 

we have invented an intelligent inverter solution that has changed the way power is harvested and managed in a solar pv system our direct current “dc” optimized inverter system maximizes power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system and providing comprehensive and advanced safety features our system consists of our power optimizers inverters and cloudbased monitoring platform and addresses a broad range of solar market segments from residential solar installations to commercial and small utilityscale solar installations since we began commercial shipments in 2010 we have shipped approximately 34 gigawatts “gw” of our dc optimized inverter systems and our products have been installed in solar pv systems in 96 countries

 

historically the solar pv industry used traditional string and central inverter architectures to harvest pv solar power however traditional inverter architectures result in energy losses as well as systemic challenges in design flexibility safety and monitoring more recently microinverter technology was introduced in an attempt to resolve these challenges but this technology has certain inherent limitations we believe that our dc optimized inverter system consisting of an inverter and distributed power optimizers best addresses all of these challenges

 

our system allows for superior power harvesting and module management relative to traditional inverter systems by deploying power optimizers at each pv module while maintaining a competitive system cost by keeping the ac inversion and grid interaction centralized using a simplified dcac inverter the entire system is monitored through our cloudbased monitoring platform that enables reduced system operation and maintenance “om” costs our system enables each pv module to operate at its own maximum power point “mpp” rather than a systemwide average enabling dynamic response to realworld conditions such as atmospheric conditions pv module aging soiling and shading and offering improved energy yield relative to traditional inverter systems in addition to higher efficiency our system’s installed cost per watt is competitive with traditional inverter systems of leading manufacturers and generally lower than comparable microinverter systems of leading manufacturers furthermore our architecture allows for complex rooftop system designs and enhanced safety and reliability our technology and system architecture are protected by 72 awarded patents and 114 patent applications filed worldwide as of june 30 2016

 

we primarily sell our products directly to large solar installers and engineering procurement and construction firms “epcs” and indirectly to thousands of smaller solar installers through large distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers our customers include leading providers of solar pv systems to residential and commercial end users key solar distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers as well as several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules

 

we were founded in 2006 and began commercial shipments in 2010 as of june 30 2016 we have shipped approximately 125 million power optimizers and 513000 inverters more than 265000 installations many of which may include multiple inverters are currently connected to and monitored through our cloudbased monitoring platform

 

limitations of existing technologies

 

a solar pv system consists of pv modules which produce direct current “dc” power when exposed to sunlight an inverter which transforms the dc power into alternating current “ac” power that is required by the electricity grid and associated cabling fuse boxes and mounting hardware traditionally solar pv systems connected strings of solar pv modules to one or more inverters for this energy conversion

 

traditional inverter architecture still constitutes the vast majority of the pv inverter market especially for larger commercial and utility installations however traditional inverter architecture suffers from significant inefficiencies leading to suboptimal power generation these challenges include

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition to power losses the traditional inverter architecture also has system design installation and operational challenges including

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the solaredge solution

 

our dc optimized inverter system maximizes power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system and providing comprehensive and advanced safety features our solution consists of our power optimizers inverters and cloudbased monitoring platform and addresses a broad range of solar market segments from residential solar installations to commercial and small utilityscale solar installations

 

the key advantages of our solution include

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our products

 

our solution consists of a dc power optimizer an inverter and a cloudbased monitoring platform that operate as a single integrated system

 

solaredge power optimizer our dc power optimizer is a highly reliable and efficient dctodc converter which is connected by installers to each pv module or embedded by pv module manufacturers into their modules as part of the manufacturing process our power optimizer increases energy output from the pv module to which it is connected by continuously tracking the mpp of each module and controlling its working point the power optimizer’s ability to track the mpp of each pv module and its ability to increase or decrease its output voltage enables the inverter’s input voltage to remain fixed under a large variety of string configurations this feature enhances flexibility in pv system designs enabling use of different string lengths in a single pv system connected to the same inverter use of pv panels situated on multiple orientations connected to the same inverter and using varied pv module types in the same string in addition our power optimizers monitor the performance of each pv module and communicates this data to our inverter using our proprietary power line communication in turn the inverter transmits this information to our monitoring server each power optimizer is equipped with our proprietary safety mechanism which automatically reduces the output voltage of each power optimizer to 1v unless the power optimizer receives a failsafe signal from a functioning inverter as a result if the inverter is shut down eg for system maintenance due to malfunction in the event of a fire or otherwise the dc voltage throughout the system is reduced to a safe level

 

our power optimizers are designed to withstand high temperatures and harsh environmental conditions and contain multiple bypass features that localize failures and enable continued system operation in the vast majority of cases of power optimizer failure our power optimizers are compatible with the vast majority of modules on the market today and carry a 25year product warranty our power optimizers are designed to be used with our inverters as well as third party inverters to provide power optimization monitoring and safety features can also be achieved with third party inverters by adding supplemental communications hardware during fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 revenues derived from the sale of power optimizers represented 488 488 and 500 of total revenues respectively

 

solaredge inverter our dctoac inverters contain sophisticated digital control technology with efficient power conversion architecture resulting in superior solar power harvesting and high reliability and are designed to work exclusively with our dc power optimizers a proprietary power line communication receiver is integrated into each inverter receiving data from our power optimizers storing this data and transmitting it to our monitoring server when an internet connection exists since each string which is equipped with our power optimizers provides fixed input voltage to our inverter the inverter is able to operate at its highest efficiency at all times and therefore is more costefficient energy efficient and reliable like our power optimizers our inverters are designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions since the power rating of an inverter determines how many pv modules it can serve larger installations require inverters with higher power ratings we currently offer our second generation of inverters which come in two models a onephase inverter designed to address the residential market 22 kilowatts “kw” to 114 kw and a threephase inverter designed to address the residential market in certain european countries and the commercial market 4 kw to 333 kw in june 2016 we introduced an extended commercial solution that consists of various inverters sized 25kw 276kw and 333kw for the europe middle east africa and asia pacific markets and 144kw and 333kw for the north american market these inverters which are identical in size and enclosure as other solaredge inverters are designed for commercial installations reduce the number of required inverters and increase the system return on investment the vast majority of our inverters are sold with a 12year warranty that is extendable to 20 or 25 years for an additional cost during fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 revenues derived from the sale of inverters represented 466 483  and 457 of total revenues respectively

 

we have completed the development of and are currently ramping up shipments of our hdwave technology inverter the hdwave inverter technology provides significant improvements in efficiency while decreasing the magnetics and cooling components in order to reduce inverter size and cost

storedge solutions our storedge solution is a dc coupled solution that is used to increase energy independence and maximize selfconsumption for homeowners by utilizing a battery which is sold separately by third party manufacturers to store and supply power as needed the solution is based on a single inverter for both solar pv and storage our storedge solution is designed to provide smart energy functions such as maximizing selfconsumption timeofuse programming for desired hours of the day and home energy backup solutions to optimize selfconsumption the battery is charged and discharged to meet consumption needs and reduce the amount of power purchased from the grid with a backup solution unused solar pv power is stored in a battery and used during a power outage or when solar pv production is insufficient when there is a power outage a combination of solar pv power and battery is used to power important sources such as the refrigerator communication devices lighting and ac outlets our proprietary monitoring platform provides visibility into battery status solar pv production and selfconsumption while offering easy maintenance with remote access to inverter and battery software existing solaredge systems can be upgraded to our storedge solution

 

solaredge monitoring software our cloudbased monitoring platform collects power voltage current and system data sent from our inverters and power optimizers and allows users to view the data at the module level string level inverter level and system level from any browser or from most smart phones and tablets the monitoring software continuously analyzes data and flags potential problems the monitoring software includes features which are used on a routine basis by integrators installers maintenance staff and system owners to improve a solar pv system’s performance by maximizing solar power harvesting and reducing om costs by increasing system uptime and detecting pv module performance issues more effectively connection to the monitoring server is completed during installation by the installer the installer then receives full access to system data through the monitoring software and can select the amount of data to be shared with the system owner

 

product roadmap

 

our products reflect the innovation focus and capabilities of our technology departments our product roadmap is divided into five categories power optimizers inverters monitoring services energy storage and smart energy management

 

power optimizers we currently sell our third generation power optimizer which was designed for fully automated assembly and which is based on our third generation asic a key element of our reliability strategy and a significant differentiator relative to our competitors is our use of proprietary asics to control among other things our power optimizer’s power conversion safety features and pv module monitoring instead of using large numbers of discrete components our power optimizer uses a single proprietary asic thus reducing the total number of components in an electrical circuit and thereby improving reliability we are in the final stages of testing our fourth generation asic and we expect to begin commercial shipments of our fourth generation power optimizers in the first half of calendar 2017 in addition we are also continuing to develop the necessary subsystems for the fifth generation asic which will be used in our fifth generation power optimizer each new asic generation has reduced the number of components required and meaningfully improved the efficiency of the power optimizer the efficiency improvement reduces the energy losses which in turn reduces the amount of heat dissipation this enables design of a more cost effective and usually smaller enclosure and also keeps the electronics cooler thereby improving the power optimizer’s reliability

 

inverters our inverter roadmap is intended to serve three purposes i expand addressable market by developing new and larger inverters designed specifically for larger commercial installations and utilityscale projects ii improve the electronics to increase the total power throughput without changing the existing enclosure thereby reducing the actual cost per watt and increasing economies of scale and iii improve ease of installation by integrating additional functionality required in certain installations in order to reduce costs of additional hardware and labor costs as part of our inverter roadmap we plan to apply our hdwave technology to threephase inverters and we are in the development process for doing so

 

 

monitoring services our cloudbased monitoring platform is continuously growing by the amount of data aggregated we are continuously developing tools to accommodate our growth and further enhance our service offering specifically we plan to increase data compression in order to enable support for a rapidly increasing number of field systems while using lowcost equipment in addition we plan to improve our reporting systems and enable users to obtain selfgenerated customized reports we also expect to expand algorithms that detect and pinpoint problems that can affect power production in field systems we further plan to add more capabilities through our public application program interface to allow users to build and integrate our system into their own systems and to allow users to build and share useful applications based on monitoring data gathered by our software

 

energy storage and shifting solaredge is working to continue to expand its thirdparty battery compatibility for the residential market for the commercial market we plan to expand our storedge product offering to the commercial and industrial sector

 

smart energy management there are currently two separate energy technology industries that exist today solar energy production and building automation technology we believe that inverters will be taking on an expanded role in energy management and automation and in conjunction with this assumption we are developing building automation products that can combine both of these industries this line of products when used with the solaredge solution will be designed to allow system owners to increase selfconsumption by shifting energy usage to match peak solar pv production as well as offer a convenient wireless control option over various building and home devices an example of this solution would be using excess solar pv energy to heat water or the ability to remotely turn on or off certain power sources such as lighting or electrical appliances the introduction of these products is dependent upon certification and region specific needs and as such cannot yet be specified

 

sales and marketing strategy

 

since commencing sales activities in early 2010 our strategy has been to focus on markets where electricity prices irradiance and government policies make solar pv installations economically viable today our products have been installed in 96 countries including the us canada belgium france germany italy the netherlands the united kingdom israel australia japan singapore and china

 

we target our sales and marketing efforts to the largest distributors electrical equipment wholesalers epc contractors and installers in each of the countries where we operate in the us germany italy the united kingdom and australia our products are carried and actively sold by most of the top solar pv distributors as well as the largest electrical distribution companies that are active in solar pv we anticipate that an increasing percentage of solar pv equipment sales will also occur through electrical equipment wholesalers who sell to a broad range of electrical contractors and we are focused on cultivating these global relationships as of june 30 2016 according to the data available on our monitoring portal approximately 13009 installers around the world have installed solaredge solar pv systems including an average of approximately 330 new installers per month since the beginning of fiscal 2016 we also sell our power optimizers to several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules

 

additionally we have a number of programs focused on educating installers and other industry professionals about our technology and we use a combination of road shows webinars and partner trainings to show them how best to design sell and implement our technology in their projects

a key factor in the performance of our power optimizer is determined by the digital control algorithms and closedloop mechanism the power optimizer’s control is built into our advanced asic which is responsible for all critical digital control functions of the power optimizer including detailed power analysis digital control of the power conversion subsystem and power line communications and networking since each power optimizer handles the power and voltage of a single module we are able to reach a high degree of semiconductor integration by leveraging low cost silicon in standard semiconductor packages as a result much of the functionality of our power optimizer can be integrated into a standard asic instead of discrete electronic components resulting in lower costs and higher reliability

 

the asic performs the critical power analysis and power conversion control functions of the power optimizer the power analysis function processes the status and working parameters at the power optimizer’s input and output and together with advanced digital control and state machine logic controls the power conversion function in addition our digital control system uses technology that allows the solar pv installation to anticipate and adapt to changing operating conditions and protect against system anomalies

 

each power optimizer in the array is connected to the inverter by a power line communications networking link our power line communications link uses a proprietary networking technology that we developed utilizing the existing dc wiring between the power optimizers and the inverter to transmit and receive data between these devices

 

 

inverters

 

our inverter is designed for singlestage dcac conversion using our inverter in combination with the power optimizers will allow the control loop to maintain a fixed dc voltage level at its input thereby allowing for longer uneven and multifaceted strings while also enabling custom cost efficient and reliable inverter design and component selection all of the power components as well as the main magnetic components for our inverters can then be optimized for dcac inversion at high efficiency

 

the digital control algorithms of our inverters are implemented using programmable digital signal processors which allow for flexibility and adaptation of control loops for various grids and for the requirements and standards of various grid operators across geographies we have already implemented the control mechanisms necessary to support advanced grid codes and standards that are required to support high penetration of solar energy into the grid

 

manufacturing

 

we have designed our manufacturing processes to produce high quality products at competitive costs the strategy is threefold outsource automate and localize we have entered into outsourcing contracts with two of the world’s leading global electronics manufacturing service providers jabil circuit inc and flextronics industrial ltd by using these contract manufacturers rather than building our own manufacturing infrastructure we are able to access advanced manufacturing equipment processes skills and capacity on a “capital light” budget our contract manufacturers are responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products except with regard to end of line testing equipment and other specific manufacturing equipment utilized in assembling our products or subcomponents we expect to continue this funding arrangement in the future with respect to any expansions to such existing lines further contracting with global providers such as jabil and flextronics gives us added flexibility to manufacture certain products in china closer to target markets in asia and the north american west coast and other products in hungary closer to target markets in europe and the north american east coast potentially increasing responsiveness to customers while reducing costs and delivery times

 

we have completed the development of our first proprietary automated assembly line for use at the hungary flextronics manufacturing plant and it is in operation and manufacturing approximately 4000 power optimizers per day this automated assembly line can also be replicated and deployed to additional production facilities we are investing resources in additional automated assembly lines as well as in automated machinery for subassembly of certain components used in our products and we will own and be responsible for funding all of the capital expenses related thereto the current and expected capital expenses associated with these automated assembly lines and other machinery are not significant and will be funded out of our cash flows in addition we are in the process of designing an automatic assembly line for the production of embedded optimizers

 

we source our raw materials through various component manufacturers and invest resources in continued cost reduction efforts as well as verifying second and third sources so as to limit dependence on sole suppliers

 

reliability and quality control

 

our power optimizers are either connected to each pv module by installers or embedded in each pv module by pv module manufacturers our power optimizers are designed to be as reliable as the pv module itself and capable of withstanding the same operating and environmental conditions

 

our reliability methodology includes a multilevel plan with design analysis subsystem testing of critical components by accelerated life testing and integrative testing of design prototypes by highly accelerated life testing and large sample groups as part of our reliability efforts we subject components to industry standard conditions and tests including in accelerated life chambers that simulate burnin thermal cycling dampheat and other stresses we also test complete products in stress tests and in the field our rigorous testing processes have helped us to develop highly reliable products

 

in order to verify the quality of each of our products when it leaves the manufacturing plant each component subassembly and final product are tested multiple times during production these tests include automatic optical inspection incircuit testing board and componentlevel functional testing safety testing and integrative stress testing we employ a serial numberdriven manufacturing process auditing and traceability system that allows us to control production line activities verify correct manufacturing processes and to achieve itemspecific traceability

 

as a part of our quality and reliability approach failed products from the field are returned and subjected to root cause analysis the results of which are used to improve our product and manufacturing processes and further reduce our field failure rate

 

 

certifications

 

our products and systems comply with the applicable regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are sold as well as all other major markets around the world collectively covering approximately 80 of the global solar pv market as measured by mw capacity shipped these include safety regulations electromagnetic compatibility standards and grid compliance

 

research and development

 

we devote substantial resources to research and development with the objective of developing new products and systems adding new features to existing products and systems and reducing unit costs of our products and systems our development strategy is to identify features products and systems for both software and hardware that reduce the cost and improve the effectiveness of our solutions for our customers we measure the effectiveness of our research and development by metrics including product unit cost efficiency reliability power output and ease of use

 

we have a strong research and development team with wideranging experience in power electronics semiconductors power line communications and networking and software engineering in addition many members of our team have expertise in solar technologies as of june 30 2016 our research and development organization had a headcount of 244 people our research and development expense net totaled 183 million 220 million and 332 million for fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively

 

intellectual property

 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies information processes and knowhow we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws in the us and similar laws in other countries confidentiality agreements and procedures and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology as of june 30 2016 we had 53 issued us patents 19 issued nonus patents 57 patent applications pending for examination in the us and 57 patent applications pending for examination in other countries all of which are related to us applications a majority of our patents relate to dc power optimization and dc to ac conversion for alternative energy power systems power system monitoring and control and management systems our issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2027 and 2036 we continually assess opportunities to seek patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages

 

we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we believe that many elements of our manufacturing processes involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes test equipment designs algorithms and procedures

 

all of our research and development personnel are required to enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us

 

our customers and business partners are required to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans

 

competition

 

the markets for our products are competitive and we compete with manufacturers of traditional inverters and manufacturers of other mlpe the principal areas in which we compete with other companies include

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our dc optimized inverter system competes principally with products from traditional inverter manufacturers such as sma solar technology ag abb ltd and huawei technologies co ltd as well as from new chinese inverter manufacturers in the north american residential market we compete with traditional inverter manufacturers as well as microinverter manufacturers such as enphase energy inc in addition several new entrants to the mlpe market including lowcost asian manufacturers have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped similar products we believe that our dc optimized inverter system offers significant technology and cost advantages that reflect a competitive differentiation over traditional inverter systems and microinverter technologies

 

government incentives

 

us federal state and local government bodies as well as nonus government bodies provide incentives to owners end users distributors and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar pv systems from property tax assessments the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of these government subsidies and economic incentives which vary by geographic market and from time to time in general the amount and availability of these incentives and subsidies to encourage the development of solar pv energy have been declining and are expected to continue to decline

 

seasonality

 

the solar energy market is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations affected by weather for example during the winter months in europe and the northeastern us where the climate is particularly cold and snowy it is typical to see a decline in pv installations and this decline can impact the timing of orders for our products

 

employees

 

as of june 30 2016 we had 608 fulltime employees of these fulltime employees 244 were engaged in research and development 143 in sales and marketing 175 in operations and support and 46 in general and administrative capacities of our employees 376 were based in israel 94 were based in the us 47 were based in china 33 were based in germany and an additional 58 were based elsewhere

 item 1a risk f actors

tableend 

 

risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in particular forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties some of which cannot be predicted or quantified see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements”

 

risks related to our business and our industry

 

we cannot be certain that we will sustain profitability in the future

 

we incurred net losses of 214 million for fiscal 2014 and we achieved a net profit of 211 million and 766 million in fiscal 2015 and 2016 respectively we expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business including in connection with marketing and developing our products expanding into new product markets and geographies maintaining and enhancing our research and development operations and hiring additional personnel in addition as a public company we incur significant additional legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company we do not know whether our revenues will grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs and our limited operating history makes it difficult to assess the extent of these expenses or their impact on our results of operations

 

further revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons many of which are outside our control including a decline in demand for our products increased competition a decrease in the growth of the solar industry or our market share or our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities if we fail to maintain sufficient revenue to support our operations we may not be able to sustain profitability

 

our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects

 

we have only been in existence since 2006 and our first full fiscal year of commercial shipments was 2011 much of our growth has occurred in recent periods our limited operating history combined with the rapidly evolving and competitive nature of our industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects in addition we have limited insight into emerging trends that may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries including unpredictable and volatile revenues and increased expenses as we continue to grow our business the viability and demand for solar energy solutions and in turn our products may be affected by many factors outside of our control including

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we do not manage these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully our business will suffer

 

if demand for solar energy solutions does not continue to grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our business will suffer

 

our solution is utilized in solar pv installations as a result our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years and we cannot be certain that consumers and businesses with respect to distributed solar solutions or utilities with respect to utilityscale solar projects will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to grow our business if demand for solar energy solutions fails to develop sufficiently demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business

 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business

 

federal state local and foreign government bodies provide incentives to owners end users distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments payments of renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar pv systems from property tax assessments the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market because our customers’ sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business these subsidies and incentives may expire on a particular date end when the allocated funding is exhausted or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase or as a result of legal challenges the adoption of new statutes or regulations or the passage of time these reductions or terminations often occur without warning

 

in addition several jurisdictions have adopted renewable portfolio standards which mandate that a certain portion of electricity delivered by utilities to customers come from a set of eligible renewable energy resources by a certain compliance date some programs further specify that a portion of the renewable energy quota must be from solar electricity under some programs a utility can receive a “credit” for renewable energy produced by a third party by either purchasing the electricity directly from the producer or paying a fee to obtain the right to renewable energy generated but used by the generator or sold to another party a renewable energy credit allows the utility to add this electricity to its renewable portfolio requirement total without actually expending the capital for generating facilities however there can be no assurances that such policies will continue for example in may 2014 ohio froze renewable portfolio requirements at current levels proposals to extend compliance deadlines reduce targets or repeal standards have also been introduced in a number of states reduction or elimination of renewable portfolio standards or successful efforts to meet current standards could harm or halt the growth of the solar pv industry and our business

 

changes to net metering policies may significantly reduce demand for electricity from solar pv systems and harm our business

 

our business benefits from favorable net metering policies in several us states canadian provinces and european countries in which our customers operate net metering allows a solar pv system owner to pay his or her local electric utility only for power usage net of production from the solar pv system transforming the conventional relationship between customers and traditional utilities system owners receive credit for the energy that the solar installation generates to offset energy usage at times when the solar installation is not generating energy under a net metering program the customer typically pays for the net energy used or receives a credit against future bills at the retail rate if more energy is produced than consumed in some locations customers are also reimbursed by the electric utility for net excess generation on a periodic basis

 

most us states have adopted some form of net metering however net metering programs have recently come under regulatory scrutiny in some us states due to challenges alleging that net metering policies inequitably shift costs onto nonsolar ratepayers by allowing solar ratepayers to sell electricity at rates that are too high for utilities to recoup their fixed costs we cannot assure you that the programs will not be significantly modified going forward 

 

 

if the value of the credit that customers receive for net metering is significantly reduced endusers may be unable to recognize the same level of cost savings associated with net metering that current endusers enjoy the absence of favorable net metering policies or of net metering entirely or the imposition of new charges that only or disproportionately affect endusers that use net metering would significantly limit demand for solar pv systems that are sold by our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future growth

 

existing electric utility industry regulations and changes to regulations may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar pv systems that may significantly reduce demand for our products or harm our ability to compete

 

federal state local and foreign government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry and internal policies and regulations promulgated by electric utilities heavily influence the market for electricity generation products and services these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and the interconnection of customerowned electricity generation and governments and utilities continuously modify these regulations and policies these regulations and policies could deter purchases of renewable energy products including solar pv systems sold by our customers this could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for our products for example utilities commonly charge fees to larger industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for backup purposes these fees could increase the cost to use solar pv systems sold by our customers and make them less desirable thereby harming our business prospects financial condition and results of operations in addition depending on the region electricity generated by solar pv systems competes most effectively with expensive peakhour electricity from the electric grid rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the utilities’ peak hour pricing policies or rate design such as to a flat rate could require the price of solar pv systems and their component parts to be lower in order to compete with the price of electricity from the electric grid

 

changes in current laws or regulations applicable to us or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the us europe or other jurisdictions in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations any changes to government or internal utility regulations and policies that favor electric utilities could reduce the competitiveness of solar pv systems sold by our customers and cause a significant reduction in demand for our products and services for example regulators in certain us states have been asked to consider proposals to assess fees on consumers purchasing energy from solar pv systems or imposing a new charge that would disproportionately impact solar pv system owners who utilize net metering either of which would increase the cost of solar pv energy to those consumers and could reduce demand for our products any similar government or utility policies adopted in the future that discourage the growth of solar pv systems could reduce demand for our products and services and adversely impact our growth in addition changes in our products or changes in export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects

 

decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid would make the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and would likely lower sales of our products the price of electricity derived from the utility grid could decrease as a result of

 

• construction of a significant number of new power generation plants including plants utilizing natural gas nuclear coal renewable energy or other generation technologies

• relief of transmission constraints that enable local centers to generate energy less expensively

 

• reductions in the price of natural gas

 

• utility rate adjustment and customer class cost reallocation

 

• energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce electricity consumption

 

• development of smartgrid technologies that lower the peak energy requirements of a utility generation facility

 

• development of new or lowercost energy storage technologies that have the ability to reduce a customer’s average

 

 

• cost of electricity by shifting load to offpeak times and

 

• development of new energy generation technologies that provide less expensive energy

moreover technological developments in the solar components industry could allow our competitors and their customers to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be achieved by us and our customers which could result in reduced demand for our products

 

if the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations incorporating our systems is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed

 

an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a solar pv system and could reduce the demand for solar systems and thus demand for our products

 

many endusers depend on financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build or purchase a solar pv system as a result an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or their customers the endusers to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a solar pv system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our products which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of endusers install solar pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through financing an increase in interest rates could lower such enduser’s return on investment on a solar pv system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar pv systems and in each case could cause such endusers to seek alternative investments

 

the market for our products is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce power optimizer inverter and solar pv system monitoring products which could negatively affect our results of operations and market share

 

the market for solar pv solutions is highly competitive we principally compete with traditional inverter manufacturers as well as microinverter manufacturers currently our dc optimized inverter system competes with products from traditional inverter manufacturers and microinverter manufacturers as well as emerging technology companies offering alternative optimizer or other mlpe products several new entrants to the inverter and mlpe market including lowcost asian manufacturers have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped products in markets in which we sell our products we expect competition to intensify as new and existing competitors enter the market

 

several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger have greater financial marketing distribution customer support and other resources are longer established and have better brand recognition further certain competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than us may partner with other competitors to provide combined technologies and competing solutions and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours in addition some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices for our products in order to compete effectively if we have to reduce our prices by more than we anticipated or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer

 

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may have a material adverse effect on demand for our offerings

 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advances in other forms of distributed solar pv power generation storage solutions such as batteries the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could result in product obsolescence the loss of competitiveness of our products decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors

 

our industry has historically been cyclical and experienced periodic downturns

 

our future success partly depends on continued demand for solar pv systems in the endmarkets we serve including the residential and commercial sectors in the united states and europe the solar industry has historically been cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns which may affect the demand for equipment that we manufacture the solar industry has undergone challenging business conditions in recent years including downward pricing pressure for pv modules mainly as a result of overproduction and reductions in applicable governmental subsidies contributing to demand decreases although the solar industry is experiencing a slow recovery there is no assurance that the solar industry will not suffer significant downturns in the future which will adversely affect demand for our solar products and our results of operations

 

 

defects or performance problems in our products could result in loss of customers reputational damage and decreased revenue and we may face warranty indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products

 

although our products meet our stringent quality requirements they may contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new generations are released errors defects or poor performance can arise due to design flaws defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties which can affect both the quality and the yield of the product any actual or perceived errors defects or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products shipment delays rejection of our products damage to our reputation lost revenue diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and increases in customer service and support costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

furthermore defective components may give rise to warranty indemnity or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive from the affected products we offer a minimum 12year limited warranty for our inverters and a 25year limited warranty for our power optimizers our limited warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship of our products under normal use and service conditions as a result we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold products and recognized revenue while we do have accrued reserves for warranty claims our estimated warranty costs for previously sold products may change to the extent future products are not compatible with earlier generation products under warranty our warranty accruals are based on our assumptions and we do not have a long history of making such assumptions as a result these assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our systems causing us to incur substantial unanticipated expense to repair or replace defective products in the future or to compensate customers for defective products our failure to accurately predict future claims could result in unexpected volatility in and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

 

if one of our products were to cause injury to someone or cause property damage including as a result of product malfunctions defects or improper installation then we could be exposed to product liability claims we could incur significant costs and liabilities if we are sued and if damages are awarded against us further any product liability claim we face could be expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention the successful assertion of a product liability claim against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages penalties or fines subject us to adverse publicity damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely affect sales of our products in addition product liability claims injuries defects or other problems experienced by other companies in the residential solar industry could lead to unfavorable market conditions for the industry as a whole and may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract new customers thus harming our growth and financial performance

 

if we do not forecast demand for our products accurately we may experience product shortages delays in product shipment excess product inventory or difficulties in planning expenses which will adversely affect our business and financial condition

 

our products are manufactured according to our estimates of customer demand which requires us to make multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to demand from solar pv installers and distributors their end customers and general market conditions because we sell a large portion of our products to larger solar installers and various distributors who in turn sell to local installers who in turn sell to their end customers the system owner we have limited visibility as to end customer demand and it is difficult to forecast future enduser demand to plan our operations if we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are cancelled or shipments are delayed we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell conversely if we underestimate demand we may not have sufficient inventory to meet end customer demand or to ramp up production at our contract manufacturers in a timely manner or we could incur additional costs lose market share damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forego potential revenue opportunities for example in fiscal 2014 unexpectedly high customer demand forced us to shorten transportation time from our factories in china and hungary by using air freight rather than less expensive ocean freight

 

 

we are dependent on ocean transportation to deliver our products in a cost efficient manner if we are unable to use ocean transportation to deliver our products our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted

 

we rely on commercial ocean transportation for the delivery of a large percentage of our products to our customers in north america we also rely on more expensive air transportation when ocean transportation is not available or compatible with the delivery time requirements of our customers our ability to deliver our products via ocean transportation could be adversely impacted by shortages in available cargo capacity changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling pricing payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel taxes and labor and other factors such as labor strikes and work stoppages not within our control if we are unable to use ocean transportation and are required to substitute more expensive air transportation our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted in the first calendar quarter of 2015 contentious negotiations between the pacific maritime association and the international longshore  warehouse union resulted in port slowdowns caused port congestion and major delays in the transfer of cargo in the united states west coast accordingly in the quarter ended march 31 2015 we shipped a higher percentage of our products to our customers in north america via air transportation material interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation such as the aforementioned dispute whether caused by strike work stoppage lockout slowdown or otherwise could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition

 

we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers

 

we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and currently rely upon two contract manufacturers to build all of our products our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs

 

the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues as a result fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner in addition the facilities in which our products are manufactured are located outside of the us currently in china and hungary the location of these facilities outside of key markets such as the us increases shipping time thereby causing a long lead time between manufacturing and delivery

 

if any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers an alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms including price any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers or increase our shipping costs to make up for delays in manufacturing which in turn could reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers and damage our reputation with local installers and potential endusers and cause us to forego potential revenue opportunities

 

we may experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations

 

our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise such processes involve a number of precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched identified and properly addressed and rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques andor expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased warranty reserve increased production and logistics costs and delays any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for key components and raw materials in our products to adequately meet anticipated demand due to the limited number of such suppliers any cessation of operations or production or any shortage delay price change imposition of tariffs or duties or other limitation on our ability to obtain the components and raw materials we use could result in sales delays cancellations and loss of market share

 

we depend on limited or single source suppliers for certain key components and raw materials used to manufacture our products making us susceptible to quality issues shortages and price changes any of these limited or single source suppliers could stop producing our components or supplying our raw materials cease operations or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with one or more of our competitors as a result these suppliers could stop selling to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all because there are a limited number of suppliers of solar pv system components and raw materials used to manufacture our products it may be difficult to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative components or raw materials on commercially reasonable terms and our ability to satisfy customer demand may be adversely affected transitioning to a new supplier or redesigning a product to accommodate a new component manufacturer would result in additional costs and delays these outcomes could harm our business or financial performance

 

 

any interruption in the supply of limited source components or raw materials for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers could result in lost revenue or higher expenses and would harm our business

 

failure by our contract manufacturers or our component or raw material suppliers to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations may adversely affect our business

 

we do not control our contract manufacturers or suppliers or their business practices accordingly we cannot guarantee that they follow ethical business practices such as fair wage practices and compliance with environmental safety and other local laws a lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative manufacturers or suppliers which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products product shortages or other disruptions of our operations violation of labor or other laws by our manufacturers or suppliers or the divergence of a supplier’s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the us or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and harm our business

 

our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter which could make our future performance difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations for a particular period to fall below expectations resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock

 

our quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the future we have experienced seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in the past as a result of seasonal fluctuations in our customers’ business for example our customers’ and endusers’ ability to install solar energy systems is affected by weather as for example during the winter months in europe and the northeastern us such installation delays can impact the timing of orders for our products further given that we are an earlystage company operating in a rapidly growing industry the true extent of these fluctuations may have been masked by our recent growth rates and consequently may not be readily apparent from our historical results of operations and may be difficult to predict our financial performance sales working capital requirements and cash flow may fluctuate and our past quarterly results of operations may not be good indicators of future performance any substantial decrease in revenues would have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price

 

we rely on distributors and large installers to assist in selling our products and the failure of these customers to perform as expected could reduce our future revenue

 

we currently sell a substantial percentage of our products through distributors who in turn sell to local installers and through direct sales to large installers we do not have exclusive arrangements with these third party distributors and large installers many of our distributors also market and sell products from our competitors and all of our large installer customers also use products from our competitors these distributors and large installers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and with little or no notice further these distributors and large installers may fail to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors termination of agreements with current distributors or large installers failure by these distributors or large installers to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new distributor or large installer relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and results of operations

if we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer

 

our future success and ability to implement our business strategy depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team and key technical personnel each of whom would be difficult to replace all of our employees including our senior management are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time competition for highly skilled individuals with technical expertise is extremely intense and we face challenges identifying hiring and retaining qualified personnel in many areas of our business integrating new employees into our team could prove disruptive to our operations require substantial resources and management attention and ultimately prove unsuccessful an inability to retain our senior management and other key personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel could limit or delay our strategic efforts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects

 

 

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management’s attention

 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” the listing requirements of the nasdaq global select market and other applicable securities rules and regulations compliance with these rules and regulations requires significant legal and financial compliance and demands on our systems and resources and makes some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly than if we were a private company as certain additional securities rules and regulations become applicable to us our legal and financial compliance costs may increase the exchange act requires among other things that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to maintain and if required improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard significant resources and management oversight are required as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could harm our business and results of operations we may need to hire more employees in the future which would increase our costs and expenses

 

if we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our business and results of operations could be materially harmed

 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and unfair competition laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we have applied for patents in the us europe and china some of which have been issued we cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology and any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to among other things rebrand or redesign our affected products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the us we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated infringed or otherwise violated

 

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert management’s attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate

 

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry from time to time we may also be subject to claims of intellectual property right infringement and related litigation and if we gain greater recognition in the market we face a higher risk of being the subject of claims that we have violated others’ intellectual property rights regardless of their merit responding to such claims can be time consuming can divert management’s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses in litigation or settlement while we believe that our products and technology do not infringe in any material respect upon any valid intellectual property rights of third parties we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims if we do not successfully defend or settle an intellectual property claim we could be liable for significant monetary damages and could be prohibited from continuing to use certain technology business methods content or brands to avoid a prohibition we could seek a license from the applicable third party which could require us to pay significant royalties increasing our operating expenses if a license is not available at all or not available on reasonable terms we may be required to develop or license a nonviolating alternative either of which could require significant effort and expense if we cannot license or develop a nonviolating alternative we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our offerings and may be unable to effectively compete any of these results would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees which could result in litigation and adversely affect our business

 

we enter into agreements with our employees pursuant to which they agree that any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement are assigned to us or owned exclusively by us depending on the jurisdiction without the employee retaining any rights a significant portion of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees in the course of their employment for us under the israeli patent law 57271967 the “patent law” inventions conceived by an employee during the scope of his or her employment with a company are regarded as “service inventions” which belong to the employer absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer giving the employee service invention rights the patent law also provides that if there is no such agreement between an employer and an employee the israeli compensation and royalties committee the “committee” a body constituted under the patent law shall determine whether the employee is entitled to remuneration for his or her inventions recent decisions by the committee and the israeli supreme court have created uncertainty in this area as the israeli supreme court held that employees may be entitled to remuneration for their service inventions despite having specifically waived any such rights further the committee has not yet determined the method for calculating this committeeenforced remuneration although our employees have agreed that any rights related to their inventions are owned exclusively by us we may face claims demanding remuneration in consideration for such acknowledgement as a consequence of such claims we could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to our current andor former employees or be forced to litigate such claims which could negatively affect our business

 

 

the loss of or events affecting one of our major customers could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

for fiscal 2016 three of our major customers in the us together accounted for 325 of our revenues our next five largest customers for fiscal 2016 together accounted for 22  of our revenues our customers’ decisions to purchase our products are influenced by a number of factors outside of our control including retail energy prices and government regulation and incentives among others in addition these customers may decide to no longer use our products and services for other reasons which may be out of our control although we have agreements with some of our largest customers these agreements do not have longterm purchase commitments and are generally terminable by either party after a relatively short notice period the loss of or events affecting one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example in april 2016 one of our customers sunedison suneq filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy laws

consolidations in the solar industry among our current or potential customers or distributors may adversely affect our competitive position    

 

    there has been an increase in consolidation activity among distributors large installers and other strategic partners in the solar industry for example in july 2016 sunedison suneq announced its intention to purchase vivint solar for 2 billion in march 2016 vivint solar announced it is terminating the merger due to sunedison’s “willful breach of the merger agreement” in june 2016 tesla motors tsla announced that it has submitted a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of solarcity corporation scty this trend could further increase our reliance on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales and may negatively impact our competitive position in the solar market

our planned expansion into new markets could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks

 

in fiscal 2016 we sold our products to approximately 220 direct customers in 45 countries including the us canada belgium france germany israel italy the netherlands the united kingdom australia japan and china we intend to introduce new products targeted at large commercial and utilityscale installations and to expand into other international markets our success in these new product and geographic markets will depend on a number of factors including our ability to develop solutions to address the requirements of the large commercial and utilityscale solar pv markets timely qualification and certification of new products for large commercial and utilityscale solar pv installations acceptance of power optimizers in solar pv markets in which they have not traditionally been used and our ability to manage increased manufacturing capacity and production

 

further these solar pv markets have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products and our success will depend on our ability to adapt properly to these differences these differences may include differing regulatory requirements including tax laws trade laws labor regulations tariffs export quotas customs duties or other trade restrictions limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection international political or economic conditions restrictions on the repatriation of earnings longer sales cycles warranty expectations product return policies and cost performance and compatibility requirements in addition expanding into new geographic markets will increase our exposure to presently existing risks such as fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and difficulties and increased expenses in complying with us and foreign laws regulations and trade standards including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa”

 

failure to develop and introduce these new products successfully or to otherwise manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to sustain profitability

 

 

if we fail to manage our recent and future growth effectively we may be unable to execute our business plan maintain high levels of customer service or adequately address competitive challenges

 

we have experienced significant growth in recent periods with our annual product sales growing rapidly from approximately 8400 inverters and approximately 181000 power optimizers in fiscal 2011 our first full fiscal year of commercial shipments to annual product sales exceeding 224000 inverters and 57 million power optimizers in fiscal 2016 we intend to continue to expand our business significantly within existing and new markets this growth has placed and any future growth may place a significant strain on our management operational and financial infrastructure in particular we will be required to expand train and manage our growing employee base and scale and otherwise improve our it infrastructure in tandem with that headcount growth our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers as well as manage multiple geographic locations

 

our current and planned operations personnel it and other systems and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth and may require us to make additional unanticipated investment in our infrastructure our success and ability to further scale our business will depend in part on our ability to manage these changes in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot manage our growth we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures this could also result in declines in quality or customer satisfaction increased costs difficulties in introducing new offerings or other operational difficulties any failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our business and reputation

 

covenants in our credit facility may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities and competitive developments and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions

 

we have a revolving line of credit from silicon valley bank “svb” the svb credit facility restricts our ability to take certain actions such as borrow money grant liens pay dividends dispose of assets or engage in certain transactions our credit agreement with svb also requires us to maintain certain ebitda and liquidity levels these restrictions may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities competitive developments and adverse economic or industry conditions in addition our obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets including all of our intellectual property which limits our ability to provide collateral for additional financing nevertheless we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future and any debt instrument we enter into in the future may contain similar restrictions or collateral packages a breach of any of these covenants or a failure to pay principal or interest when due could result in a variety of adverse consequences including the acceleration of our indebtedness our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings if some or all of our indebtedness is accelerated acceleration could result in the foreclosure by the lenders on our assets that secure the credit facility

 

furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into new debt instruments on acceptable terms if we are unable to satisfy financial covenants and other terms under existing or new credit arrangements or obtain waivers or forbearance from our lenders or if we are unable to obtain refinancing or new financings for our working capital equipment and other needs on acceptable terms if and when needed our business would be adversely affected

 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations

 

although our financial results are reported in us dollars us dollar revenues accounted for 760  of our revenues in fiscal 2016 in addition a significant portion of our operating expenses are accrued in new israeli shekels primarily related to payroll and to a lesser extent the euro and other currencies our profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and to a lesser extent the new israeli shekel and other currencies in which we generate revenues incur expenses and maintain cash balances foreign currency fluctuations may also affect the prices of our products our prices are denominated primarily in us dollars if there is a significant devaluation of a particular currency the prices of our products will increase relative to the local currency and may be less competitive despite our efforts to minimize foreign currency risks primarily by entering into forward hedging transactions to sell euro for us dollars at a predefined rate and maintaining cash balances in new israeli shekels significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values in particular a significant change in the relative values of the euro and to a lesser extent the new israeli shekel and other currencies against the us dollar could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition

 

 

any unauthorized access to or disclosure or theft of personal information we gather store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation

 

we receive store and use certain personal information of our customers and the endusers of our customers’ solar pv systems including names addresses email addresses credit information and energy production statistics we also store and use personal information of our employees we take steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the personal information we collect store and transmit but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we and our suppliers or vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures

 

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee or contractor error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information were to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws

 

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws however we currently operate in and intend to further expand into many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our entry into certain jurisdictions requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from us standards it is possible that our employees subcontractors agents and partners may take actions in violation of our policies and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us to criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation

 

risks related to operations in israel

 

conditions in israel affect our operations and may limit our ability to develop produce and sell our products

 

although we are incorporated in delaware our headquarters and research and development center are located in israel accordingly political economic and military conditions in israel directly affect us israel has been involved in a number of armed conflicts and has been the target of terrorist activity ongoing state of hostility varying in degree such as rocket fire from the gaza strip including against civilian targets has occurred on an irregular basis disrupting daytoday civilian activity and negatively affecting business conditions israel also faces threats from hezbollah militants in lebanon and others we cannot predict whether or when such armed conflicts or attacks may occur or the extent to which such events may impact us any future armed conflict political instability or violence in the region may impede our ability to manage our business effectively or to engage in research and development or may otherwise adversely affect our business or operations in the event of war we and our israeli subcontractors and suppliers may cease operations which may cause delays in the distribution and sale of our products some of our directors executive officers and employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and are subject to being called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances in the event that our principal executive office is damaged as a result of hostile action or hostilities otherwise disrupting the ongoing operation of our offices our ability to operate could be materially adversely affected

 

additionally several countries principally in the middle east restrict doing business with israeli companies and additional countries and groups may impose similar restrictions if hostilities in israel or political instability in the region continue or increase if recent regime changes and civil wars in neighboring states result in the establishment of fundamentalist islamic regimes or governments more hostile to israel or if egypt or jordan abrogates its respective peace treaty with israel israel could be subject to additional political economic and military confines and our operations and ability to sell our products to countries in the region could be materially adversely affected these restrictions may limit materially our ability to obtain manufactured components and raw materials or to sell our products

 

 

any hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners or significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

the tax benefits that are available to us under israeli law require us to meet various conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future which could increase our costs and taxes

 

our israeli subsidiary is eligible for certain tax benefits provided to “benefited enterprises” under the israeli law for the encouragement of capital investments 1959 the “investment law” in order to remain eligible for the tax benefits for “benefited enterprises” we must continue to meet certain conditions stipulated in the investment law and its regulations as amended if these tax benefits are reduced cancelled or discontinued our israeli taxable income would be subject to regular israeli corporate tax rates and we may be required to refund any tax benefits that we have already received plus interest and penalties thereon the standard corporate tax rate for israeli companies was increased to 265 in 2014 and 2015 and decreased back to 25 in 2016 and thereafter additionally if we increase our activities outside of israel through acquisitions for example our expanded activities might not be eligible for inclusion in future israeli tax benefit programs the israeli government may furthermore independently determine to reduce phase out or eliminate entirely the benefit programs under the investment law regardless of whether we then qualify for benefits under those programs at the time which would also adversely affect our global tax rate and our results of operations

 

the terms of israeli government grants that we have received restrict our ability to transfer technologies outside of israel and we may be required to pay penalties in such a case or upon the sale of our company

 

in fiscal 2016 we received a total of 02 million from the office of the chief scientist in the israel ministry of economy “ocs” we do not expect to receive additional grants from the ocs in fiscal 2016 the terms of the previous grants require us to pay royalties at a rate of 4 to 45 on sales of products developed under these grants up to the total grant amount linked to the us dollar and bearing interest at an annual rate of libor applicable to dollar deposits even after payment in full we will still be required to comply with the requirements of the israeli encouragement of industrial research and development law 1984 the “rd law” and related regulations with respect to those past grants when a company develops knowhow technology or products under an ocs grant the grant terms and the rd law restrict the transfer outside of israel of such knowhow without the prior approval of the ocs consequently if aspects of our technologies are deemed to have been developed with ocs funding the discretionary approval of an ocs committee would be required for any transfer to third parties outside of israel of knowhow related to those aspects of our technologies the ocs may impose conditions on any arrangement under which it permits us to transfer technology or development out of israel or may not grant such approval at all

 

any transfer of ocssupported technology or knowhow outside of israel may require payment of significant amounts to the ocs depending on the value of the transferred technology or knowhow the amount of ocs support the time of completion of the ocssupported research project and other factors these restrictions and requirements for payment may impair our ability to sell our technology assets outside of israel furthermore the consideration available to our shareholders in a transaction involving the transfer outside of israel of technology or knowhow developed with ocs funding such as a merger or similar transaction would be reduced by any amounts that we are required to pay to the ocs

 

it may be difficult to enforce a judgment of a us court against our officers and directors to assert us securities laws claims in israel or to serve process on our officers and directors

 

the majority of our directors and executive officers reside outside of the us and most of our assets and most of the assets of these persons are located outside of the us consequently a judgment obtained against any of these persons including a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws may not be collectible in the us it also may be difficult for you to effect service of process on these persons in the us or to assert us securities law claims in original actions instituted in israel israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of us securities laws on the grounds that israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim in addition even if an israeli court hears a claim it may determine that israeli law and not us law is applicable to the claim if us law is found to be applicable the content of applicable us law must be proven as a fact by expert witnesses which can be a time consuming and costly process further an israeli court may not enforce a judgment awarded by a us or other nonisraeli court certain matters of procedure will also be governed by israeli law there is little binding case law in israel that addresses these matters as a result of the difficulty associated with enforcing a judgment against any of these persons in israel you may not be able to obtain or enforce a judgment against many of our directors and executive officers

 

 

risks related to the ownership of our common stock

 

we cannot assure you that our stock price will not decline or not be subject to significant volatility

 

the trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in march 2015 at a price of 1800 per share during fiscal year 2016 the reported high and low prices of our common stock has ranged from 1502 to 3811 per share the price of our stock may change in response to fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods and also may change in response to other factors including factors specific to companies in our industry many of which are beyond our control as a result our share price may experience significant volatility and may not necessarily reflect the value of our expected performance among other factors that could affect our stock price are

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  further the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies in addition the stock prices of many renewable energy companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial cost and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business

 

 

 

the price of our common stock could decline if securities analysts or other third parties publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or if one or more of our analysts ceases to cover us or to regularly publish reports about us

 

the trading of our common stock is likely to be influenced by the reports and research that industry or securities analysts publish about us our business our market or our competitors if one or more securities or industry analysts downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price would likely decline if one or more securities or industry analysts ceases to cover the company or fails to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline

 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management

 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may believe advantageous these provisions include

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” which generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder becomes an “interested” stockholder

 

 

our certificate of incorporation includes a forum selection clause which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us

 

our certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder including any beneficial owner to bring i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or employees to us or to our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or iv any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine will be a state court located within the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware in all cases subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions this forum selection provision may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us it is also possible that notwithstanding the forum selection clause that is included in our certificate of incorporation a court outside of delaware could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable

 

we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future

 

we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors subject to applicable laws and provisions of our debt instruments and organizational documents after taking into account our financial condition results of operations capital requirements general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant as a result capital appreciation in the price of our common stock if any may be your only source of gain on an investment in our common stock

 

if we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls we may not be able to report our financial results accurately which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and timeconsuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and requires attestations of the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors we need to implement substantial control systems and procedures in order to satisfy the reporting requirements under the exchange act and applicable nasdaq global select market requirements among other items establishing these internal controls will be costly and may divert management’s attention

 

evaluation by us of our internal controls over financial reporting may identify material weaknesses that may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences including sanctions by the sec or violations of nasdaq global select market rules there also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and could also lead to a decline in the price of our common stock

tableend 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the sections of this annual report on form 10k captioned “selected consolidated financial data and other data” and “business” and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form 10k in addition to historical financial information the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors including those discussed under the sections of this annual report captioned “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors”

 

overview

 

we are a leading provider of intelligent inverter solutions that are changing the way power is harvested and managed in solar pv systems our dc optimized inverter solution maximizes power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system our systems allow for superior power harvesting and module management by deploying power optimizers at each pv module while maintaining a competitive system cost by using a simplified dcac inverter our systems are monitored through our cloudbased monitoring platform that enables lower system operating and maintenance “om” costs we believe that these benefits along with our comprehensive and advanced safety features are highly valued by our customers

 

we are a leader in the global module level power electronics “mlpe” market according to gtm research and as of june 30 2016 we have shipped approximately 125 million power optimizers and 513000 inverters approximately 265000 installations many of which may include multiple inverters are currently connected to and monitored through our cloudbased monitoring platform as of june 30 2016 we have shipped approximately 34 gw of our dc optimized inverter systems our products have sold in approximately 55 countries and are installed in solar pv systems in 96 countries

 

we primarily sell our products directly to large solar installers epcs and indirectly to thousands of smaller solar installers through large distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers our sales strategy focuses on toptier customers in markets where electricity prices irradiance amount of sunlight and government policies make solar pv installations economically viable we also sell our power optimizers to several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules

 

in fiscal 2016 we sold our products to approximately 220 direct customers in 45 countries and as of june 30 2016 approximately 163989 indirect customers had registered with us through our cloudbased monitoring platform in fiscal 2016 three customers accounted for revenues of above 10 each together comprising an aggregate of 325 of our sales of these customers two are distributors

 

we were founded in 2006 with the goal of addressing the lost power generation potential that is inherent in the use of traditional solar pv inverter technology thereby increasing the return on investment in solar pv systems the following is a chronology of some of our key milestones

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have achieved substantial growth since we commenced commercial shipments in fiscal 2010 our revenues were 1332 million 3251 million and 4898 million for fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively gross margins were 165 252 and 310 for fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively net loss was  214 million for fiscal 2014 and net profits were 211 million and 766 million for fiscal 2015 and 2016 respectively

 

we continue to focus on our longterm growth we believe that our market opportunity is large and that the transition from traditional inverter architecture to dc optimized inverter architecture as the architecture of choice for distributed solar installations globally will continue we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this market trend we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to acquire new customers in our existing markets grow internationally and drive additional revenue we also plan to expand our product offerings to further penetrate the large commercial and utility segments we expect to continue to invest in research and development to enhance our product offerings and develop new cost effective solutions

 

we believe that our strategy results in a lean operating base with low expenses that will enable profitability on lower revenues relative to our competitors we believe that our sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the longterm as we continue to grow due to economies of scale with this increased operating leverage we expect our gross and operating margins to increase in the longterm

 

performance measures

 

in managing our business and assessing financial performance we supplement the information provided by the financial statements with other operating metrics these operating metrics are utilized by our management to evaluate our business measure our performance identify trends affecting our business and formulate projections we use metrics relating to yearly shipments inverters shipped power optimizers shipped and megawatts shipped to evaluate our sales performance and to track market acceptance of our products from year to year we use metrics relating to monitoring systems monitored and megawatts monitored to evaluate market acceptance of our products and usage of our solution

 

we provide the “megawatts shipped” metric which is calculated based on nameplate capacity shipped to show adoption of our system on a nameplate capacity basis nameplate capacity shipped is the maximum rated power output capacity of an inverter and corresponds to our financial results in that higher total capacities shipped are generally associated with higher total revenues however revenues increase with each additional unit not necessarily each additional mw of capacity sold accordingly we also provide the “inverters shipped” and “power optimizers shipped” operating metrics

 

key components of our results of operations

 

the following discussion describes certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations

 

 

revenues

 

we generate revenues from the sale of dc optimized inverter systems for solar pv installations which include power optimizers inverters and our cloudbased monitoring platform our customer base includes large solar installers distributors wholesalers epcs and pv module manufacturers

 

our revenues are affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our dc optimized inverter systems the volume and average selling price of our systems is driven by the supply and demand for our products changes in the product mix between our residential and commercial products the customer mix between large and small customers the geographical mix of our sales sales incentives enduser government incentives seasonality and competitive product offerings

 

our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to expand our market share in each of the geographies in which we compete expand our global footprint to new evolving markets grow our production capabilities to meet demand and to continue to develop and introduce new and innovative products that address the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers

 

cost of revenues and gross profit

 

cost of revenues consists primarily of product costs including purchases from our contract manufacturers and other suppliers as well as costs related to shipping customer support product warranty personnel depreciation of test and manufacturing equipment hosting services for our cloudbased monitoring platform and other logistics services our product costs are affected by technological innovations such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions economies of scale resulting in lower component costs and improvements in production processes and automation some of these costs primarily personnel and depreciation of test and manufacturing equipment are not directly affected by sales volume

 

we outsource our manufacturing to thirdparty manufacturers and negotiate product pricing on a quarterly basis our thirdparty manufacturers are responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products except with regard to end of line testing equipment and the automated assembly lines for our power optimizers as further described below which resulted in capital expenditures of 28 million and 52 million for fiscal 2015 and 2016 respectively we expect to continue this funding arrangement in the future with respect to any expansions to such existing lines we also procure strategic and critical components from various approved vendors on behalf of our contract manufacturers at times higher than anticipated demand has exceeded the production capacities of these manufacturers in 2014 and early 2015 for example such production shortfalls as well as shortages in the supply of certain raw materials required us to use air freight rather than less expensive ocean freight to deliver the majority of our products the expansion of current manufacturing sites by our contract manufacturers allowed us to reduce these expenses in fiscal 2015 as well as to build sufficient inventory to continue our growth without the need to ship substantial amounts of products by air in 2016 we managed to continuously increase the efficiency of our supply chain reduce our reliance on air freight to a minimum and use ocean freight for the majority of our shipments we believe that continued expansion of the current manufacturing sites by our contract manufacturers and the development and deployment of our proprietary automated assembly line described below will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our forecasted demands with minimal shipment of products by air freight

 

we completed development of our first proprietary automated assembly line for our power optimizers and have ordered an additional four lines for the automated manufacturing of our power optimizers we expect to continue to invest in additional automated assembly lines in the future we have designed and are responsible for funding all of the capital expenses associated with existing and future automated assembly lines the current and expected capital expenses associated with these automated assembly lines will be funded out of our cash flows

 

key components of our logistics supply channel consist of third party distribution centers in the us and europe finished goods are either shipped to our customers directly from our contract manufacturers or shipped to third party distribution centers and then finally shipped to our customers

 

cost of revenues also includes our operations and support departments’ costs the operations department is responsible for production management such as planning procurement supply chain production methodologies and machinery planning logistics management and manufacturing support to our contract manufacturers as well as the quality assurance of our products our support department provides customer and technical support at various levels through our call centers around the world as well as second and third level support services which are provided by support personnel located in our headquarters our fulltime employee headcount in our operations and support departments has grown from 57 as of june 30 2014 to 106 as of june 30 2015 to 175 as of june 30 2016

 

gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices product costs product mix customer mix geographical mix shipping method warranty costs and seasonality

 

 

operating expenses

 

operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnelrelated costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories and include salaries benefits payroll taxes commissions and stockbased compensation our fulltime employee headcount in our research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative departments has grown from 239 as of june 30 2014 to 334 as of june 30 2015 to 434 as of june 30 2016 we expect to continue to hire significant numbers of new employees to support our growth the timing of these additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses in any particular period both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue we expect to continue to invest substantial resources to support our growth and anticipate that each of the following categories of operating expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts for the foreseeable future

  

research and development expenses net

 

research and development expenses net include personnelrelated expenses such as salaries benefits stockbased compensation and payroll taxes our research and development employees are engaged in the design and development of power electronics semiconductors software and power line communications and networking our research and development expenses also include thirdparty design and consulting costs materials for testing and evaluation asic development and licensing costs depreciation expense and other indirect costs we devote substantial resources to ongoing research and development programs that focus on enhancements to and cost efficiencies in our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation thereby maintaining our competitive position

gains or losses related to remeasurement of warrants granted in relation to longterm debt incurred by the company in december 2012 are not expected to occur in the future as the warrants were fully exercised on june 18 2015

 

our functional currency is the us dollar with respect to our subsidiaries other than our israeli subsidiary the functional currency is the applicable local currency financial expenses net is net of financial income which consists primarily of the effect of foreign exchange differences between the us dollar and the new israeli shekel the euro and other currencies related to our monetary assets and liabilities and the realization of gain from hedging transactions

 

 

 

we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we operate

 

from incorporation through the end of fiscal 2014 we experienced operating losses and consequently accumulated a significant amount of operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions by the end of fiscal 2015 we fully utilized our unused operating loss carryforwards with respect to us federal tax obligations in fiscal 2015 we recorded an income tax expense of 17 million for federal and state taxes in the us in fiscal 2016 we recorded a net income tax expenses of 04 million for federal and state tax in the us which consist 18 million current income tax expenses and 14 million deferred tax asset

 

solaredge technologies ltd our israeli subsidiary is taxed under israeli law income not eligible for benefits under the investment law is taxed at the corporate tax rate the corporate tax rate in israel was 265 in fiscal 2014 and 2015 a recent amendment of the israeli income tax ordinance decreased the corporate tax rate to 25 commencing on january 1 2016 however the effective tax rate payable by a company that derives income from a “benefited enterprise” or a “preferred enterprise” as defined under the investment law may be considerably less capital gains derived by an israeli company are subject to tax at the prevailing corporate tax rate

 

our subsidiaries are subject to taxes in each of the countries in which they operate all of our products are developed and manufactured by our subsidiary solaredge technologies ltd which sells our products to its customers as well as to other entities in the solaredge group which then sell them to their customers all intercompany sales of products and services are paid for or reimbursed pursuant to transfer price policies established for each of the countries in which we operate consistent with arm’s length profit levels

 

due to our history of losses from inception through the end of fiscal 2014 we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in fiscal 2015 the first fiscal year in which we were profitable we used a portion of our carryforward losses from previous years in israel and california in fiscal 2016 we continued being profitable stopped recording valuation allowances and started recording deferred tax assets in the amount of 50 million in israel most of which is related to operating loss carryforward

debt obligations

 

 

 

in june 2011 we entered into an agreement with svb for a revolving line of credit which permitted borrowings of up to 20 million subject to certain limitations based on our accounts receivable and inventories interest was payable at a prime rate plus margin of 075 to 275 the average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings during fiscal 2014 was 49 in october 2014 we had entirely repaid the revolving line of credit with svb

 

 

 

in february 2015 we amended and restated an agreement with svb for a revolving line of credit which permits aggregate borrowings of up to 40 million in an amount not to exceed 80 of the eligible accounts receivable and bears interest payable monthly at svb’s prime rate plus a margin of 05 to 20 the revolving line of credit will terminate and outstanding borrowings will be payable on december 31 2016 as of june 30 2016 we had no outstanding borrowings under our 40 million revolving line of credit with svb

 

in connection with the amended and restated revolving line of credit we granted svb security interests in substantially all of our assets including a firstpriority security interest in our trade receivables cash and cash equivalents the “svb priority collateral” the agreement contains certain financial covenants requiring us to maintain ebitda and liquidity at specified levels specifically we are required to maintain negative adjusted ebitda defined in accordance with us gaap as a net income plus b the extent deducted in the calculation of net income interest taxes depreciation and amortization plus c to the extent deducted in the calculation of net income noncash stockbased compensation of no greater than 1500000 as of march 31 2015 and positive adjusted ebitda of at least i 1500000 as of june 30 2015 ii 3500000 as of september 30 2015 and december 31 2015 iii 1500000 as of march 31 2016 and iv 3500000 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 and for each calendar quarter thereafter in addition we are required to maintain liquidity defined as our unrestricted and unencumbered cash plus availability under the revolving line of credit of 6750000 the amended and restated revolving line of credit also contains covenants that restrict our ability to borrow money grant liens pay dividends dispose of assets or engage in business combinations as of june 30 2016 the company met all covenants related to this revolving credit line

 

 

 

 

on december 28 2012 we entered into a term loan agreement with kreos providing for a term loan of up to 10 million which was fully drawn on the closing date the borrowings under the term loan were primarily used to finance working capital needs on january 26 2015 we repaid the entire outstanding balance of the kreos term loan

 

interest on the term loan was payable monthly at a rate of 1190 per year compounded on a monthly basis principal is paid in 33 equal monthly installments from september 1 2013 through may 1 2016 the last of which was prepaid in advance pursuant to the terms of the term loan payments of principal and interest on the term loan were in euros

 

    in connection with the term loan agreement we granted kreos 563014 d1 warrants to purchase series d1 convertible preferred shares at an exercise price of 2309 the d1 warrants were exercised on june 18 2015 and we issued to kreos 154768 shares of common stock we believe that cash provided by operating activities as well as our cash and cash equivalents including the net proceeds from our initial public offering and available borrowings under our currently undrawn revolving credit line with svb as further described above will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months in the future we expect our operating and capital expenditures to increase as we expand our business and grow our revenue which results in increased accounts receivable and inventory balances and increased headcount our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to substantial risks described under the caption “risk factors” if any of these risks materialize we may be unable to generate or sustain positive cash flow from operating activities or raise additional capital we would then be required to use existing cash and cash equivalents to support our working capital and other cash requirements if additional sources of liquidity are required to support our working capital requirements or operational expansion we may seek to raise funds through debt financing or from other sources in the future but we can provide no assurance that these transactions could be consummated on terms acceptable to us or at all failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position

 

contractual obligations

 

the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30 2016

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements

 

in fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements

 

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates

 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “gaap” the preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain

 

 

revenue recognition

 

we generate revenues from the sale of dc optimized inverter systems for solar pv installations which include our power optimizers inverters and cloudbased monitoring platform our worldwide customer base includes large solar installers distributors epcs and pv module manufacturers our products are fully functional at the time of shipment to the customer and do not require production modification or customization we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred iii the price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured provisions for rebates sales incentives and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded

 

we generally sell our products to our customers pursuant to a customer’s standard purchase order and our customary terms and conditions we do not offer rights to return our products other than for normal warranty conditions and as such revenue is recorded upon shipment of products to customers and transfer of title and risk of loss under standard commercial terms we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine that appropriate credit limits are established prior to the acceptance and shipment of an order

 

prior to may 2013 we provided our full webbased monitoring platform free of charge for a limited period of time after which the customer could elect whether to continue and receive a basic service for free or subscribe for a full line of services revenues associated with our webbased monitoring platform were recognized ratably over the term of 18 to 36 months the free of charge period and revenues associated with the basic functionality were recognized ratably over 25 years since may 2013 we have provided our full webbased monitoring platform free of charge and revenues associated with the service since that date are being recognized ratably over 25 years in the absence of vendorspecific objective evidence or third party comparable pricing for such service management determines the revenue levels of this service based on the costs associated with providing the service plus appropriate margins that reflect management’s best estimate of the selling price since may 2013 these revenues were minimal and we do not expect this to become a significant source of revenue in the near future

 

product warranty

 

we provide a standard limited product warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions our standard warranty period is 25 years for our power optimizers 12 years for our inverters and 10 years for our storage interface in certain cases customers can purchase extended warranties for inverters that increase the warranty period to up to 25 years

 

our products are designed to meet the warranty periods and our reliability procedures cover component selection design accelerated life cycle tests and end of manufacturing line testing however since our history in selling power optimizers and inverters is substantially shorter than the warranty period the calculation of warranty provisions is inherently uncertain

 

we accrue for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based on anticipated warranty claims and actual historical warranty claims experience warranty provisions are computed on a perunit sold basis are based on our best estimate of such costs and are included in our cost of revenues the warranty obligation is determined based on actual and predicted failure rates of the products cost of replacement and service and delivery costs incurred to correct a product failure our warranty obligation requires management to make assumptions regarding estimated failure rates and replacement costs

 

in order to predict the failure rate of each of our products we have established a reliability model based on the estimated mean time between failures “mtbf” the mtbf represents the average elapsed time predicted for each product unit between failures during operation applying the mtbf failure rate over our install base for each product type and generation allows us to predict the number of failed units over the warranty period and estimates the costs associated with the product warranty predicted failure rates are updated periodically based on data returned from the field and new product versions as are replacement costs which are updated to reflect changes in our actual production costs for our products labor costs and actual logistics costs

 

 

since the mtbf model does not take into account additional nonsystematic failures such as failures caused by workmanship or manufacturing or designrelated issues and since warranty claims are at times opened for cases in which the error has been triggered by an improper installation we have developed a supplemental model to predict such cases and recognize the associated expenses ratably over the expected claim period this model which is based on actual root cause analysis of returned products identification of the causes of claims and time until each identified problem is revealed allows us to better predict actual warranty expenses and is updated periodically based on our experience taking into account the installed base of approximately 125 million power optimizers and approximately 513000 inverters as of june 30 2016

 

if actual warranty costs differ significantly from these estimates adjustments may be required in the future which could adversely affect our gross profit and results of operations warranty obligations are classified as short term and long term warranty obligations based on the period in which the warranty is expected to be claimed the warranty provision short and long term was 182 million 319 million and 512 million in fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively

 

inventory valuation

 

our inventories comprise sellable finished goods raw materials bought on behalf of our contract manufacturers and faulty units returned under our warranty policy

 

sellable finished goods and raw material inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based on the moving average cost method certain factors could affect the realizable value of our inventories including market and economic conditions technological changes existing product changes mainly due to cost reduction activities and new product introductions we consider historic usage expected demand anticipated sales price the effect of new product introductions product obsolescence product merchantability and other factors when evaluating the value of inventories inventory writedowns are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and their estimated fair market value inventory writedowns are recorded as cost of revenues in the accompanying statements of operations and were 11 million 10 million and 25 million in fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively

 

faulty products returned under our warranty policy are often refurbished and used as replacement units in warranty cases as we do not yet have sufficient history of refurbish utilization rates such products are written off upon receipt

 

we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that we use to record inventory at the lower of cost or market however if estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner we may be exposed to losses that could be material

 

stockbased compensation expense

 

we account for stockbased compensation granted to employees nonemployee directors and independent contractors in accordance with asc 718 “compensation — stock compensation” and asc 50550 “equitybased payments to nonemployees” which require the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stockbased payment awards based on fair value

 

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model the stockbased compensation expense net of forfeitures is recognized using a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award which is generally four years estimated forfeitures are based on actual historical prevesting forfeitures

 

 

 

the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the fair value of the underlying common stock the expected volatility of the price of our common stock the expected term of the option riskfree interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment if factors change and different assumptions are used our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future these assumptions are estimated as follows

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of the assumptions used in the blackscholesmerton model change significantly future stockbased compensation awards for employees may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously

 

the following table presents the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted to employees during the periods presented

 

 

 

during fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 we incurred a noncash stockbased compensation expense of 1082000 2956000 and 9044000 respectively we expect to continue to grant stock options in the future and to the extent that we do our actual sharebased compensation expense for employees and consultants recognized will likely increase

 item 7a quant itative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates customer concentrations and interest rates we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes

 

foreign currency exchange risk

 

approximately 318 and 220 of our revenues for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 respectively were earned in nonus dollar denominated currencies principally the euro our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located primarily the us dollar and new israeli shekel and to a lesser extent the euro and british pound sterling our new israeli shekeldenominated expenses consist primarily of personnel and overhead costs our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 95 million for fiscal 2016 a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the new israeli shekel and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 32 million for fiscal 2016

 

for purposes of our consolidated financial statements local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the us dollar on the balance sheet date and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rate as of the date of the transaction or at the average exchange rate to the us dollar during the reporting period

 

to date we have used derivative financial instruments specifically foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign currency risks by hedging a portion of our account receivable balances denominated in euros expected to be paid within six months our foreign currency forward contracts are expected to mitigate exchange rate changes related to the hedged assets we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes

 

we had cash and cash equivalents of 98 million 1448 million and 740 million at june 30 2014 june 30 2015 and june 30 2016 respectively which was held for working capital purposes in addition we had availableforsale marketable securities with an estimated fair value of 1116 million on june 30 2016  since most of our investments and cash and cash equivalents are held in us dollardenominated money market funds we believe that our cash and cash equivalents do not have any material exposure to changes in exchange rates

 

interest rate risk

 

as of june 30 2016 we had no outstanding borrowings

 

concentrations of major customers

 

our trade accounts receivables potentially expose us to a concentration of credit risk with our major customers for fiscal 2016 three major customers accounted for 325 of total revenues and as of june 30 2016 these same customers accounted for approximately 354 of our consolidated trade receivables balance we currently do not foresee a credit risk associated with these receivables in fiscal 2015 and 2014 one major customer accounted for 246 and 191 of our total revenues respectively

 

inflation

 

we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the last three years if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

 

commodity price risk

 

we are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials including copper which are used in our products prices of these raw materials may be affected by supply restrictions or other market factors from time to time and we do not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate commodity risk significant price changes for these raw materials could reduce our operating margins if we are unable to recover such increases from our customers and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

disclosure controls and procedures

 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of june 30 2016 in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs

 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles

 

management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2016 the end of our 2016 fiscal year management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework management’s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment

 

based on this assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors

 

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young independently assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in the firm’s attestation report which is incorporated by reference into part ii item 8 of this form 10k

 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how welldesigned and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

changes in internal control over financial reporting

 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

compensation objectives and guiding principles

 

the primary objectives of our executive compensation program are as follows

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements of compensation

 

the following table describes each element of our senior executive compensation program and how these elements achieve our compensation objectives

 

 

implementing compensation objectives

 

determining compensation

 

in making compensation decisions we review the performance of the company and each senior executive we also consider the senior executive’s level of responsibility the importance of the senior executive’s role in achieving our corporate objectives and the senior executive’s longterm potential while taking into account his or her current target compensation value of outstanding equity awards and stock ownership levels and our stock selling restrictions for senior executives finally we weigh competitive practices relevant business and organizational changes retention needs and internal pay equity

 

in order to attract retain and motivate the best management talent we believe that we must provide a target compensation package that is competitive relative to our peers in connection therewith the compensation committee considers practices of specific companies that we identified as our peers for executive compensation in 2016 the “2016 peer group” as well as sizeappropriate technology industry survey data

 

each year the compensation committee reviews the market data with the assistance of its external compensation consultant and makes changes as appropriate in order to ensure it continues to appropriately reflect the company’s size industry and scope of operations

 

for fiscal 2016 working with frederic w cook  co inc “fw cook” the compensation committee approved the below 2016 peer group based on multiple factors including business similarities and broadly comparable financial profiles  ie  revenue market capitalization enterprise value and growth profiles the 2016 peer group used for establishing 2016 senior executive target compensation was as follows generac holdings inc verint systems inc mks instruments inc stratasys ltd powell industries inc polypore international inc advanced energy industries inc ormat technologies ltd mellanox technologies ltd xura ltd formerly comverse inc enphase energy inc tessera technologies inc solarcity corporation vicor corporation and wixcom ltd

 

when the compensation committee evaluated the 2016 peer group our revenues were positioned at approximately the thirtyfifth percentile compared to the group our operating income was at approximately the fiftythird percentile and our market capitalization was at approximately the fortyfirst percentile

 

after reviewing the peer group data described above we determined the approximate range within which to target total direct compensation the sum of base salary target annual incentive and the grant date fair value of longterm incentives for our senior executives for 2016 within that range we incorporated flexibility to respond to and adjust for the evolving business environment and our specific hiring and retention needs

 

in general for 2016 we set base salary and short and longterm incentive compensation opportunities for our senior executives including the neos at or near the median of the peer group proxy and survey data where applicable as described below individual levels varied from the targeted position for each of the elements of target total direct compensation based on the compensation committee’s overall subjective evaluation of individual performance senior executive responsibilities relative to benchmark position responsibilities and individual skill set and experience

 

role of compensation committee and management

 

the compensation committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the design and implementation of our senior executive compensation programs the compensation committee with input from the other independent directors evaluates the performance of the ceo the compensation committee then recommends ceo compensation to the independent directors for approval the ceo and the compensation committee together review the performance of our other senior executives and the compensation committee determines their compensation based on recommendations from the ceo the executives do not play a role in their own individual compensation determinations

 

role of compensation consultants

 

with respect to decisions for 2016 target compensation of the neos competitive review of senior executive and nonemployee director compensation programs and peer group review for 2016 the compensation committee retained fw cook to review market trends and advise the compensation committee fw cook is the sole compensation consultant of the compensation committee 

our compensation committee has concluded that no conflicts of interest exist with respect to fw cook’s provision of services after considering the following six factors i the provision of other services to us by fw cook ii the amount of fees fw cook received from us as a percentage of the total revenue of fw cook iii the policies and procedures of fw cook that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest iv any business or personal relationship of the fw cook consultants with a member of the compensation committee v any of our stock owned by the fw cook consultants and vi any business or personal relationship of the fw cook consultants or fw cook with any of our executive officers

 

the compensation committee is directly responsible for the appointment compensation and oversight of fw cook fw cook reported directly to the compensation committee although the compensation committee instructed fw cook to work with management to compile information and to gain an understanding of the company and any companyrelated issues for consideration by the compensation committee including market trends

 

compensationrelated governance policies

 

stock ownership and holding guidelines

 

effective march 31 2015 all of our employees including the neos are subject to our insider trading policy which forbids employees to trade in the company’s stock or any derivatives thereof while holding nonpublic material information or during the company’s set “blackout periods”

 

compensation of the named executive officers

 

in determining target total compensation for our neos for 2016 we evaluated the financial and operational performance of the company and considered each senior executive’s contributions to that performance as part of the annual senior executive compensation review the compensation committee reviewed independent market data as well as thencurrent pay levels of the company’s senior executives the company’s pay philosophy and corporate performance and the individual performance of the company’s senior executives

 

for a discussion of the company’s 2016 performance see “ executive summary — 2016 results and key events ” above

 

 

base salary

 

the compensation committee and the independent directors in the case of the ceo approved fiscal 2016 base salaries for the neos in august 2015 the salaries reflected significant increases in base salaries for all of our neos which were made to i align the cashequity mix of compensation to that of a publicly–traded profitable company following the company’s recent ipo and ii to fall within the range of the median relative to the benchmarking market data consistent with the compensation committee’s stated philosophy as noted above the following table sets forth the 2016 base salaries for the neos

 

 

annual cash incentive compensation

 

for calendar year 2015 each neo was eligible to receive an annual incentive compensation payment based on achievement of pre‑established performance goals for mr sella the performance goals were 100 weighted based upon company‑related financial operational and strategic objectives comprised of 70 financial achievement 10 operations 10 strategy and 10 scalability for the remaining neos the performance goals were weighted based upon 50 company‑related financial operational and strategic objectives the same as for the ceo and 50 individual performance the company exceeded the financial goals by exceeding revenues profitability and gross margin targets specifically the financial achievement parameters of the bonuses were contingent upon the company meeting its targeted annual calendar revenues of 345 million a net income of 20 million and achieving a gross margin of above 25 the company exceeded all of these parameters by achieving revenues of 4247 million a net income of 538 million and a gross margin of 292 the individual performance goals relate to each neo’s specific areas of contribution to the company such as specific goals for the development of products for our vice president of research and development or the penetration of sales in certain new geographic regions for our vice president of sales each of the neos received a bonus under the compensation plan that had been preapproved by the committee and after review by the committee of the specific performance goals and determination of their level of achievement specifically mr sella was awarded 714528 which represents 140 of his base salary mr faier was awarded 260841 which represents 87 of his base salary mr lando was awarded 247065 which represents 82 of his base salary mr galin was awarded 235933 which represents 86 of his base salary and ms prishkolnik was awarded 202542 which represents 81 of her base salary these performancebased cash bonuses were paid in march 2016 for achievement of business objectives established by the committee for calendar year 2015

 

equity compensation

 

in august 2015 the committee evaluated the equity compensation of the ceo and other senior executives as part of the study performed by fw cook in order to align neo compensation with the median of the 2016 peer group with adjustments as necessary based on the committee’s overall subjective evaluation of individual performance senior executive responsibilities relative to benchmark position responsibilities and individual skill set and experience the committee approved annual longterm incentive grants for the ceo and other neos as well as the other senior executives consisting of 50 rsus 40 options and 10 performancebased rsus all of the equity grants have a fouryear vesting period the options were granted at an exercise price of 2509 which was the fair market value of the shares as of the date of the grant the rationale of granting options to senior executives is to create more leverage and greater wealth creation opportunity that can materially impact financial and stock price performance consistent with typical market practice and aligning senior executives with the interests of the company’s shareholders the options have strong performance orientation since they only provide value if the stock price increases the timevested rsus which are granted to all of the company’s employees offer more certainty in value delivery while still being shareholder aligned thereby driving executive retention the committee also allocated 10 of the equity grants to the ceo and other neos in the form of performance based rsus which were linked to the same company and individual performance goals used in the annual incentive program for calendar 2015 entitlement to the performance based rsus was evaluated based on the achievement of the same calendar 2015 bonus criterion vest over a four year period from the date of grant

 

employment agreements

    during fiscal 2016 we were party to employment agreements with messrs sella faier lando galin and ms prishkolnik each of these employment agreements provides for employment of the neo on an “at‑will” basis and provide for a base salary vacation sick leave payments to a pension and severance fund as well as an israeli recreational fund and recuperation pay in accordance with israeli law see the section below titled “ executive compensation table narrative  employment agreements” for more information

 

other compensation 

our ceo and the remaining neos receive benefits that we generally make available to all salaried employees in israel where the neos are located these include contributions to an education fund and to a fund known as manager’s insurance which provides a combination of retirement plan insurance and severance pay benefits to israeli employees see the section below titled “ executive compensation table narrative  employment agreements” for more information executives do not receive any special perquisites not extended to other employees of the company

 

tax deductibility of compensation

 

in general section 162m of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended imposes a limit of 1 million on the amount that a publicly held corporation may deduct for federal income tax purposes for compensation paid to the company’s “covered employees” generally its chief executive officer and three other executive officers other than its chief financial officer whose compensation is disclosed this limitation does not apply to compensation that meets the requirements under section 162m for “qualifying performancebased” compensation  ie  compensation paid only if performance meets preestablished objective goals established by a compensation committee that is comprised solely of two or more “outside directors” based on criteria approved by stockholders with respect to the deductibility limit of section 162m of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended we generally try to preserve the federal income tax deductibility of compensation paid when it is appropriate and is in our best interests however we reserve the right to authorize the payment of nondeductible compensation if we deem that it is appropriate to do so under the circumstances

compensation risk

 

our compensation programs are designed to balance risk and reward in relation to the company’s overall business strategy management assessed and the compensation committee reviewed our senior executive and broadbased compensation and benefits programs based on this assessment we have concluded that our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us among the program attributes that discourage inappropriate risktaking are

introduction

 

we have invented an intelligent inverter solution that has changed the way power is harvested and managed in a solar pv system our direct current “dc” optimized inverter system maximizes power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system and providing comprehensive and advanced safety features our system consists of our power optimizers inverters and cloudbased monitoring platform and addresses a broad range of solar market segments from residential solar installations to commercial and small utilityscale solar installations since we began commercial shipments in 2010 we have shipped approximately 34 gigawatts “gw” of our dc optimized inverter systems and our products have been installed in solar pv systems in 96 countries

 

historically the solar pv industry used traditional string and central inverter architectures to harvest pv solar power however traditional inverter architectures result in energy losses as well as systemic challenges in design flexibility safety and monitoring more recently microinverter technology was introduced in an attempt to resolve these challenges but this technology has certain inherent limitations we believe that our dc optimized inverter system consisting of an inverter and distributed power optimizers best addresses all of these challenges

 

our system allows for superior power harvesting and module management relative to traditional inverter systems by deploying power optimizers at each pv module while maintaining a competitive system cost by keeping the ac inversion and grid interaction centralized using a simplified dcac inverter the entire system is monitored through our cloudbased monitoring platform that enables reduced system operation and maintenance “om” costs our system enables each pv module to operate at its own maximum power point “mpp” rather than a systemwide average enabling dynamic response to realworld conditions such as atmospheric conditions pv module aging soiling and shading and offering improved energy yield relative to traditional inverter systems in addition to higher efficiency our system’s installed cost per watt is competitive with traditional inverter systems of leading manufacturers and generally lower than comparable microinverter systems of leading manufacturers furthermore our architecture allows for complex rooftop system designs and enhanced safety and reliability our technology and system architecture are protected by 72 awarded patents and 114 patent applications filed worldwide as of june 30 2016

 

we primarily sell our products directly to large solar installers and engineering procurement and construction firms “epcs” and indirectly to thousands of smaller solar installers through large distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers our customers include leading providers of solar pv systems to residential and commercial end users key solar distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers as well as several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules

 

we were founded in 2006 and began commercial shipments in 2010 as of june 30 2016 we have shipped approximately 125 million power optimizers and 513000 inverters more than 265000 installations many of which may include multiple inverters are currently connected to and monitored through our cloudbased monitoring platform

 

limitations of existing technologies

 

a solar pv system consists of pv modules which produce direct current “dc” power when exposed to sunlight an inverter which transforms the dc power into alternating current “ac” power that is required by the electricity grid and associated cabling fuse boxes and mounting hardware traditionally solar pv systems connected strings of solar pv modules to one or more inverters for this energy conversion

 

traditional inverter architecture still constitutes the vast majority of the pv inverter market especially for larger commercial and utility installations however traditional inverter architecture suffers from significant inefficiencies leading to suboptimal power generation these challenges include

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition to power losses the traditional inverter architecture also has system design installation and operational challenges including

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the solaredge solution

 

our dc optimized inverter system maximizes power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system and providing comprehensive and advanced safety features our solution consists of our power optimizers inverters and cloudbased monitoring platform and addresses a broad range of solar market segments from residential solar installations to commercial and small utilityscale solar installations

 

the key advantages of our solution include

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our products

 

our solution consists of a dc power optimizer an inverter and a cloudbased monitoring platform that operate as a single integrated system

 

solaredge power optimizer our dc power optimizer is a highly reliable and efficient dctodc converter which is connected by installers to each pv module or embedded by pv module manufacturers into their modules as part of the manufacturing process our power optimizer increases energy output from the pv module to which it is connected by continuously tracking the mpp of each module and controlling its working point the power optimizer’s ability to track the mpp of each pv module and its ability to increase or decrease its output voltage enables the inverter’s input voltage to remain fixed under a large variety of string configurations this feature enhances flexibility in pv system designs enabling use of different string lengths in a single pv system connected to the same inverter use of pv panels situated on multiple orientations connected to the same inverter and using varied pv module types in the same string in addition our power optimizers monitor the performance of each pv module and communicates this data to our inverter using our proprietary power line communication in turn the inverter transmits this information to our monitoring server each power optimizer is equipped with our proprietary safety mechanism which automatically reduces the output voltage of each power optimizer to 1v unless the power optimizer receives a failsafe signal from a functioning inverter as a result if the inverter is shut down eg for system maintenance due to malfunction in the event of a fire or otherwise the dc voltage throughout the system is reduced to a safe level

 

our power optimizers are designed to withstand high temperatures and harsh environmental conditions and contain multiple bypass features that localize failures and enable continued system operation in the vast majority of cases of power optimizer failure our power optimizers are compatible with the vast majority of modules on the market today and carry a 25year product warranty our power optimizers are designed to be used with our inverters as well as third party inverters to provide power optimization monitoring and safety features can also be achieved with third party inverters by adding supplemental communications hardware during fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 revenues derived from the sale of power optimizers represented 488 488 and 500 of total revenues respectively

 

solaredge inverter our dctoac inverters contain sophisticated digital control technology with efficient power conversion architecture resulting in superior solar power harvesting and high reliability and are designed to work exclusively with our dc power optimizers a proprietary power line communication receiver is integrated into each inverter receiving data from our power optimizers storing this data and transmitting it to our monitoring server when an internet connection exists since each string which is equipped with our power optimizers provides fixed input voltage to our inverter the inverter is able to operate at its highest efficiency at all times and therefore is more costefficient energy efficient and reliable like our power optimizers our inverters are designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions since the power rating of an inverter determines how many pv modules it can serve larger installations require inverters with higher power ratings we currently offer our second generation of inverters which come in two models a onephase inverter designed to address the residential market 22 kilowatts “kw” to 114 kw and a threephase inverter designed to address the residential market in certain european countries and the commercial market 4 kw to 333 kw in june 2016 we introduced an extended commercial solution that consists of various inverters sized 25kw 276kw and 333kw for the europe middle east africa and asia pacific markets and 144kw and 333kw for the north american market these inverters which are identical in size and enclosure as other solaredge inverters are designed for commercial installations reduce the number of required inverters and increase the system return on investment the vast majority of our inverters are sold with a 12year warranty that is extendable to 20 or 25 years for an additional cost during fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 revenues derived from the sale of inverters represented 466 483  and 457 of total revenues respectively

 

we have completed the development of and are currently ramping up shipments of our hdwave technology inverter the hdwave inverter technology provides significant improvements in efficiency while decreasing the magnetics and cooling components in order to reduce inverter size and cost

storedge solutions our storedge solution is a dc coupled solution that is used to increase energy independence and maximize selfconsumption for homeowners by utilizing a battery which is sold separately by third party manufacturers to store and supply power as needed the solution is based on a single inverter for both solar pv and storage our storedge solution is designed to provide smart energy functions such as maximizing selfconsumption timeofuse programming for desired hours of the day and home energy backup solutions to optimize selfconsumption the battery is charged and discharged to meet consumption needs and reduce the amount of power purchased from the grid with a backup solution unused solar pv power is stored in a battery and used during a power outage or when solar pv production is insufficient when there is a power outage a combination of solar pv power and battery is used to power important sources such as the refrigerator communication devices lighting and ac outlets our proprietary monitoring platform provides visibility into battery status solar pv production and selfconsumption while offering easy maintenance with remote access to inverter and battery software existing solaredge systems can be upgraded to our storedge solution

 

solaredge monitoring software our cloudbased monitoring platform collects power voltage current and system data sent from our inverters and power optimizers and allows users to view the data at the module level string level inverter level and system level from any browser or from most smart phones and tablets the monitoring software continuously analyzes data and flags potential problems the monitoring software includes features which are used on a routine basis by integrators installers maintenance staff and system owners to improve a solar pv system’s performance by maximizing solar power harvesting and reducing om costs by increasing system uptime and detecting pv module performance issues more effectively connection to the monitoring server is completed during installation by the installer the installer then receives full access to system data through the monitoring software and can select the amount of data to be shared with the system owner

 

product roadmap

 

our products reflect the innovation focus and capabilities of our technology departments our product roadmap is divided into five categories power optimizers inverters monitoring services energy storage and smart energy management

 

power optimizers we currently sell our third generation power optimizer which was designed for fully automated assembly and which is based on our third generation asic a key element of our reliability strategy and a significant differentiator relative to our competitors is our use of proprietary asics to control among other things our power optimizer’s power conversion safety features and pv module monitoring instead of using large numbers of discrete components our power optimizer uses a single proprietary asic thus reducing the total number of components in an electrical circuit and thereby improving reliability we are in the final stages of testing our fourth generation asic and we expect to begin commercial shipments of our fourth generation power optimizers in the first half of calendar 2017 in addition we are also continuing to develop the necessary subsystems for the fifth generation asic which will be used in our fifth generation power optimizer each new asic generation has reduced the number of components required and meaningfully improved the efficiency of the power optimizer the efficiency improvement reduces the energy losses which in turn reduces the amount of heat dissipation this enables design of a more cost effective and usually smaller enclosure and also keeps the electronics cooler thereby improving the power optimizer’s reliability

 

inverters our inverter roadmap is intended to serve three purposes i expand addressable market by developing new and larger inverters designed specifically for larger commercial installations and utilityscale projects ii improve the electronics to increase the total power throughput without changing the existing enclosure thereby reducing the actual cost per watt and increasing economies of scale and iii improve ease of installation by integrating additional functionality required in certain installations in order to reduce costs of additional hardware and labor costs as part of our inverter roadmap we plan to apply our hdwave technology to threephase inverters and we are in the development process for doing so

 

 

monitoring services our cloudbased monitoring platform is continuously growing by the amount of data aggregated we are continuously developing tools to accommodate our growth and further enhance our service offering specifically we plan to increase data compression in order to enable support for a rapidly increasing number of field systems while using lowcost equipment in addition we plan to improve our reporting systems and enable users to obtain selfgenerated customized reports we also expect to expand algorithms that detect and pinpoint problems that can affect power production in field systems we further plan to add more capabilities through our public application program interface to allow users to build and integrate our system into their own systems and to allow users to build and share useful applications based on monitoring data gathered by our software

 

energy storage and shifting solaredge is working to continue to expand its thirdparty battery compatibility for the residential market for the commercial market we plan to expand our storedge product offering to the commercial and industrial sector

 

smart energy management there are currently two separate energy technology industries that exist today solar energy production and building automation technology we believe that inverters will be taking on an expanded role in energy management and automation and in conjunction with this assumption we are developing building automation products that can combine both of these industries this line of products when used with the solaredge solution will be designed to allow system owners to increase selfconsumption by shifting energy usage to match peak solar pv production as well as offer a convenient wireless control option over various building and home devices an example of this solution would be using excess solar pv energy to heat water or the ability to remotely turn on or off certain power sources such as lighting or electrical appliances the introduction of these products is dependent upon certification and region specific needs and as such cannot yet be specified

 

sales and marketing strategy

 

since commencing sales activities in early 2010 our strategy has been to focus on markets where electricity prices irradiance and government policies make solar pv installations economically viable today our products have been installed in 96 countries including the us canada belgium france germany italy the netherlands the united kingdom israel australia japan singapore and china

 

we target our sales and marketing efforts to the largest distributors electrical equipment wholesalers epc contractors and installers in each of the countries where we operate in the us germany italy the united kingdom and australia our products are carried and actively sold by most of the top solar pv distributors as well as the largest electrical distribution companies that are active in solar pv we anticipate that an increasing percentage of solar pv equipment sales will also occur through electrical equipment wholesalers who sell to a broad range of electrical contractors and we are focused on cultivating these global relationships as of june 30 2016 according to the data available on our monitoring portal approximately 13009 installers around the world have installed solaredge solar pv systems including an average of approximately 330 new installers per month since the beginning of fiscal 2016 we also sell our power optimizers to several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules

 

additionally we have a number of programs focused on educating installers and other industry professionals about our technology and we use a combination of road shows webinars and partner trainings to show them how best to design sell and implement our technology in their projects

 

our customers

 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from key solar distributors electrical equipment wholesalers and large installers in the us and worldwide in fiscal 2016 three of our customers two distributors and one large installer represented325 of our revenues we fill orders primarily as they are received and as such do not have significant backlog

 

 

training and customer support

 

we offer our installer base a comprehensive package of customer support and training services which include presales support ongoing trainings and technical support before during and after installation we also provide customized support programs to pv module manufacturers large installers and distributors to help prioritize and track support issues thereby enabling short cycle times for issue resolution in 2016 we conducted approximately 281 training events in 20 countries with an aggregate of approximately 7003 attendees

 

we offer a wide variety of training including handson and ondemand video sessions and online product and training materials we support our commercial system customers with design consulting throughout their sales process and installation our technical support organization includes local expert teams call centers in the usa germany australia netherlands and israel and an online service portal our tollfree call centers are open monday through friday from 900 am to 800 pm in every region in which we sell our products in addition customers can open and track support cases 247 utilizing our online portal all support cases are monitored via a customer relationship management system in order to ensure service track closure of all customer issues and further improve our customer service our call centers have access to our cloudbased monitoring platform database which enables realtime remote diagnostics

 

customer service and satisfaction has been a key component of our business and we expect it to continue to be integral to our success in the future we maintain high levels of customer engagement through our call centers in california germany and israel in addition to our call centers we have field service engineers located in the geographies where we are active and support our customers with commissioning of large projects introduction of new technologies and features and onthejob training of new installers as of june 30 2016 our customer support and training organization consisted of 91 employees worldwide

 

our technology

 

we have drawn on our expertise in the fields of power electronics magnetic design mechanical and heat dissipation capabilities control loops and algorithms and power line communications to design and develop what we believe to be the most advanced commercial solutions for harvesting power from solar pv systems our advanced technologies are explained in more detail below

 

power optimizers

 

our power optimizers are dcdc step upstep down buckboost converters designed and developed to operate in harsh outdoor environments at very high conversion efficiency our power optimizers include proprietary power electronics customized to efficiently convert power from the pv module to the inverter the conversion topology and components are all designed for the power optimizer specifications and verified for consistent performance and reliability in numerous lab tests and simulations

 

a key factor in the performance of our power optimizer is determined by the digital control algorithms and closedloop mechanism the power optimizer’s control is built into our advanced asic which is responsible for all critical digital control functions of the power optimizer including detailed power analysis digital control of the power conversion subsystem and power line communications and networking since each power optimizer handles the power and voltage of a single module we are able to reach a high degree of semiconductor integration by leveraging low cost silicon in standard semiconductor packages as a result much of the functionality of our power optimizer can be integrated into a standard asic instead of discrete electronic components resulting in lower costs and higher reliability

 

the asic performs the critical power analysis and power conversion control functions of the power optimizer the power analysis function processes the status and working parameters at the power optimizer’s input and output and together with advanced digital control and state machine logic controls the power conversion function in addition our digital control system uses technology that allows the solar pv installation to anticipate and adapt to changing operating conditions and protect against system anomalies

 

each power optimizer in the array is connected to the inverter by a power line communications networking link our power line communications link uses a proprietary networking technology that we developed utilizing the existing dc wiring between the power optimizers and the inverter to transmit and receive data between these devices

 

 

inverters

 

our inverter is designed for singlestage dcac conversion using our inverter in combination with the power optimizers will allow the control loop to maintain a fixed dc voltage level at its input thereby allowing for longer uneven and multifaceted strings while also enabling custom cost efficient and reliable inverter design and component selection all of the power components as well as the main magnetic components for our inverters can then be optimized for dcac inversion at high efficiency

 

the digital control algorithms of our inverters are implemented using programmable digital signal processors which allow for flexibility and adaptation of control loops for various grids and for the requirements and standards of various grid operators across geographies we have already implemented the control mechanisms necessary to support advanced grid codes and standards that are required to support high penetration of solar energy into the grid

 

manufacturing

 

we have designed our manufacturing processes to produce high quality products at competitive costs the strategy is threefold outsource automate and localize we have entered into outsourcing contracts with two of the world’s leading global electronics manufacturing service providers jabil circuit inc and flextronics industrial ltd by using these contract manufacturers rather than building our own manufacturing infrastructure we are able to access advanced manufacturing equipment processes skills and capacity on a “capital light” budget our contract manufacturers are responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products except with regard to end of line testing equipment and other specific manufacturing equipment utilized in assembling our products or subcomponents we expect to continue this funding arrangement in the future with respect to any expansions to such existing lines further contracting with global providers such as jabil and flextronics gives us added flexibility to manufacture certain products in china closer to target markets in asia and the north american west coast and other products in hungary closer to target markets in europe and the north american east coast potentially increasing responsiveness to customers while reducing costs and delivery times

 

we have completed the development of our first proprietary automated assembly line for use at the hungary flextronics manufacturing plant and it is in operation and manufacturing approximately 4000 power optimizers per day this automated assembly line can also be replicated and deployed to additional production facilities we are investing resources in additional automated assembly lines as well as in automated machinery for subassembly of certain components used in our products and we will own and be responsible for funding all of the capital expenses related thereto the current and expected capital expenses associated with these automated assembly lines and other machinery are not significant and will be funded out of our cash flows in addition we are in the process of designing an automatic assembly line for the production of embedded optimizers

 

we source our raw materials through various component manufacturers and invest resources in continued cost reduction efforts as well as verifying second and third sources so as to limit dependence on sole suppliers

 

reliability and quality control

 

our power optimizers are either connected to each pv module by installers or embedded in each pv module by pv module manufacturers our power optimizers are designed to be as reliable as the pv module itself and capable of withstanding the same operating and environmental conditions

 

our reliability methodology includes a multilevel plan with design analysis subsystem testing of critical components by accelerated life testing and integrative testing of design prototypes by highly accelerated life testing and large sample groups as part of our reliability efforts we subject components to industry standard conditions and tests including in accelerated life chambers that simulate burnin thermal cycling dampheat and other stresses we also test complete products in stress tests and in the field our rigorous testing processes have helped us to develop highly reliable products

 

in order to verify the quality of each of our products when it leaves the manufacturing plant each component subassembly and final product are tested multiple times during production these tests include automatic optical inspection incircuit testing board and componentlevel functional testing safety testing and integrative stress testing we employ a serial numberdriven manufacturing process auditing and traceability system that allows us to control production line activities verify correct manufacturing processes and to achieve itemspecific traceability

 

as a part of our quality and reliability approach failed products from the field are returned and subjected to root cause analysis the results of which are used to improve our product and manufacturing processes and further reduce our field failure rate

 

 

certifications

 

our products and systems comply with the applicable regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are sold as well as all other major markets around the world collectively covering approximately 80 of the global solar pv market as measured by mw capacity shipped these include safety regulations electromagnetic compatibility standards and grid compliance

 

research and development

 

we devote substantial resources to research and development with the objective of developing new products and systems adding new features to existing products and systems and reducing unit costs of our products and systems our development strategy is to identify features products and systems for both software and hardware that reduce the cost and improve the effectiveness of our solutions for our customers we measure the effectiveness of our research and development by metrics including product unit cost efficiency reliability power output and ease of use

 

we have a strong research and development team with wideranging experience in power electronics semiconductors power line communications and networking and software engineering in addition many members of our team have expertise in solar technologies as of june 30 2016 our research and development organization had a headcount of 244 people our research and development expense net totaled 183 million 220 million and 332 million for fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively

 

intellectual property

 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies information processes and knowhow we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws in the us and similar laws in other countries confidentiality agreements and procedures and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology as of june 30 2016 we had 53 issued us patents 19 issued nonus patents 57 patent applications pending for examination in the us and 57 patent applications pending for examination in other countries all of which are related to us applications a majority of our patents relate to dc power optimization and dc to ac conversion for alternative energy power systems power system monitoring and control and management systems our issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2027 and 2036 we continually assess opportunities to seek patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages

 

we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we believe that many elements of our manufacturing processes involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes test equipment designs algorithms and procedures

 

all of our research and development personnel are required to enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us

 

our customers and business partners are required to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans

 

competition

 

the markets for our products are competitive and we compete with manufacturers of traditional inverters and manufacturers of other mlpe the principal areas in which we compete with other companies include

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our dc optimized inverter system competes principally with products from traditional inverter manufacturers such as sma solar technology ag abb ltd and huawei technologies co ltd as well as from new chinese inverter manufacturers in the north american residential market we compete with traditional inverter manufacturers as well as microinverter manufacturers such as enphase energy inc in addition several new entrants to the mlpe market including lowcost asian manufacturers have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped similar products we believe that our dc optimized inverter system offers significant technology and cost advantages that reflect a competitive differentiation over traditional inverter systems and microinverter technologies

 

government incentives

 

us federal state and local government bodies as well as nonus government bodies provide incentives to owners end users distributors and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar pv systems from property tax assessments the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of these government subsidies and economic incentives which vary by geographic market and from time to time in general the amount and availability of these incentives and subsidies to encourage the development of solar pv energy have been declining and are expected to continue to decline

 

seasonality

 

the solar energy market is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations affected by weather for example during the winter months in europe and the northeastern us where the climate is particularly cold and snowy it is typical to see a decline in pv installations and this decline can impact the timing of orders for our products

 

employees

 

as of june 30 2016 we had 608 fulltime employees of these fulltime employees 244 were engaged in research and development 143 in sales and marketing 175 in operations and support and 46 in general and administrative capacities of our employees 376 were based in israel 94 were based in the us 47 were based in china 33 were based in germany and an additional 58 were based elsewhere

we incurred net losses of 214 million for fiscal 2014 and we achieved a net profit of 211 million and 766 million in fiscal 2015 and 2016 respectively we expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business including in connection with marketing and developing our products expanding into new product markets and geographies maintaining and enhancing our research and development operations and hiring additional personnel in addition as a public company we incur significant additional legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company we do not know whether our revenues will grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs and our limited operating history makes it difficult to assess the extent of these expenses or their impact on our results of operations

 

further revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons many of which are outside our control including a decline in demand for our products increased competition a decrease in the growth of the solar industry or our market share or our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities if we fail to maintain sufficient revenue to support our operations we may not be able to sustain profitability

 

our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects

 

we have only been in existence since 2006 and our first full fiscal year of commercial shipments was 2011 much of our growth has occurred in recent periods our limited operating history combined with the rapidly evolving and competitive nature of our industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects in addition we have limited insight into emerging trends that may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries including unpredictable and volatile revenues and increased expenses as we continue to grow our business the viability and demand for solar energy solutions and in turn our products may be affected by many factors outside of our control including

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we do not manage these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully our business will suffer

 

if demand for solar energy solutions does not continue to grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our business will suffer

 

our solution is utilized in solar pv installations as a result our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years and we cannot be certain that consumers and businesses with respect to distributed solar solutions or utilities with respect to utilityscale solar projects will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to grow our business if demand for solar energy solutions fails to develop sufficiently demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business

 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business

 

federal state local and foreign government bodies provide incentives to owners end users distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments payments of renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar pv systems from property tax assessments the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market because our customers’ sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business these subsidies and incentives may expire on a particular date end when the allocated funding is exhausted or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase or as a result of legal challenges the adoption of new statutes or regulations or the passage of time these reductions or terminations often occur without warning

 

in addition several jurisdictions have adopted renewable portfolio standards which mandate that a certain portion of electricity delivered by utilities to customers come from a set of eligible renewable energy resources by a certain compliance date some programs further specify that a portion of the renewable energy quota must be from solar electricity under some programs a utility can receive a “credit” for renewable energy produced by a third party by either purchasing the electricity directly from the producer or paying a fee to obtain the right to renewable energy generated but used by the generator or sold to another party a renewable energy credit allows the utility to add this electricity to its renewable portfolio requirement total without actually expending the capital for generating facilities however there can be no assurances that such policies will continue for example in may 2014 ohio froze renewable portfolio requirements at current levels proposals to extend compliance deadlines reduce targets or repeal standards have also been introduced in a number of states reduction or elimination of renewable portfolio standards or successful efforts to meet current standards could harm or halt the growth of the solar pv industry and our business

 

changes to net metering policies may significantly reduce demand for electricity from solar pv systems and harm our business

 

our business benefits from favorable net metering policies in several us states canadian provinces and european countries in which our customers operate net metering allows a solar pv system owner to pay his or her local electric utility only for power usage net of production from the solar pv system transforming the conventional relationship between customers and traditional utilities system owners receive credit for the energy that the solar installation generates to offset energy usage at times when the solar installation is not generating energy under a net metering program the customer typically pays for the net energy used or receives a credit against future bills at the retail rate if more energy is produced than consumed in some locations customers are also reimbursed by the electric utility for net excess generation on a periodic basis

 

most us states have adopted some form of net metering however net metering programs have recently come under regulatory scrutiny in some us states due to challenges alleging that net metering policies inequitably shift costs onto nonsolar ratepayers by allowing solar ratepayers to sell electricity at rates that are too high for utilities to recoup their fixed costs we cannot assure you that the programs will not be significantly modified going forward 

 

 

if the value of the credit that customers receive for net metering is significantly reduced endusers may be unable to recognize the same level of cost savings associated with net metering that current endusers enjoy the absence of favorable net metering policies or of net metering entirely or the imposition of new charges that only or disproportionately affect endusers that use net metering would significantly limit demand for solar pv systems that are sold by our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future growth

 

existing electric utility industry regulations and changes to regulations may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar pv systems that may significantly reduce demand for our products or harm our ability to compete

 

federal state local and foreign government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry and internal policies and regulations promulgated by electric utilities heavily influence the market for electricity generation products and services these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and the interconnection of customerowned electricity generation and governments and utilities continuously modify these regulations and policies these regulations and policies could deter purchases of renewable energy products including solar pv systems sold by our customers this could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for our products for example utilities commonly charge fees to larger industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for backup purposes these fees could increase the cost to use solar pv systems sold by our customers and make them less desirable thereby harming our business prospects financial condition and results of operations in addition depending on the region electricity generated by solar pv systems competes most effectively with expensive peakhour electricity from the electric grid rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the utilities’ peak hour pricing policies or rate design such as to a flat rate could require the price of solar pv systems and their component parts to be lower in order to compete with the price of electricity from the electric grid

 

changes in current laws or regulations applicable to us or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the us europe or other jurisdictions in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations any changes to government or internal utility regulations and policies that favor electric utilities could reduce the competitiveness of solar pv systems sold by our customers and cause a significant reduction in demand for our products and services for example regulators in certain us states have been asked to consider proposals to assess fees on consumers purchasing energy from solar pv systems or imposing a new charge that would disproportionately impact solar pv system owners who utilize net metering either of which would increase the cost of solar pv energy to those consumers and could reduce demand for our products any similar government or utility policies adopted in the future that discourage the growth of solar pv systems could reduce demand for our products and services and adversely impact our growth in addition changes in our products or changes in export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects

 

decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid would make the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and would likely lower sales of our products the price of electricity derived from the utility grid could decrease as a result of

 

• construction of a significant number of new power generation plants including plants utilizing natural gas nuclear coal renewable energy or other generation technologies

• relief of transmission constraints that enable local centers to generate energy less expensively

 

• reductions in the price of natural gas

 

• utility rate adjustment and customer class cost reallocation

 

• energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce electricity consumption

 

• development of smartgrid technologies that lower the peak energy requirements of a utility generation facility

 

• development of new or lowercost energy storage technologies that have the ability to reduce a customer’s average

 

 

• cost of electricity by shifting load to offpeak times and

 

• development of new energy generation technologies that provide less expensive energy

moreover technological developments in the solar components industry could allow our competitors and their customers to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be achieved by us and our customers which could result in reduced demand for our products

 

if the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations incorporating our systems is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed

 

an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a solar pv system and could reduce the demand for solar systems and thus demand for our products

 

many endusers depend on financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build or purchase a solar pv system as a result an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or their customers the endusers to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a solar pv system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our products which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of endusers install solar pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through financing an increase in interest rates could lower such enduser’s return on investment on a solar pv system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar pv systems and in each case could cause such endusers to seek alternative investments

 

the market for our products is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce power optimizer inverter and solar pv system monitoring products which could negatively affect our results of operations and market share

 

the market for solar pv solutions is highly competitive we principally compete with traditional inverter manufacturers as well as microinverter manufacturers currently our dc optimized inverter system competes with products from traditional inverter manufacturers and microinverter manufacturers as well as emerging technology companies offering alternative optimizer or other mlpe products several new entrants to the inverter and mlpe market including lowcost asian manufacturers have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped products in markets in which we sell our products we expect competition to intensify as new and existing competitors enter the market

 

several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger have greater financial marketing distribution customer support and other resources are longer established and have better brand recognition further certain competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than us may partner with other competitors to provide combined technologies and competing solutions and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours in addition some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices for our products in order to compete effectively if we have to reduce our prices by more than we anticipated or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer

 

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may have a material adverse effect on demand for our offerings

 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advances in other forms of distributed solar pv power generation storage solutions such as batteries the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could result in product obsolescence the loss of competitiveness of our products decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors

 

our industry has historically been cyclical and experienced periodic downturns

 

our future success partly depends on continued demand for solar pv systems in the endmarkets we serve including the residential and commercial sectors in the united states and europe the solar industry has historically been cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns which may affect the demand for equipment that we manufacture the solar industry has undergone challenging business conditions in recent years including downward pricing pressure for pv modules mainly as a result of overproduction and reductions in applicable governmental subsidies contributing to demand decreases although the solar industry is experiencing a slow recovery there is no assurance that the solar industry will not suffer significant downturns in the future which will adversely affect demand for our solar products and our results of operations

 

 

defects or performance problems in our products could result in loss of customers reputational damage and decreased revenue and we may face warranty indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products

 

although our products meet our stringent quality requirements they may contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new generations are released errors defects or poor performance can arise due to design flaws defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties which can affect both the quality and the yield of the product any actual or perceived errors defects or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products shipment delays rejection of our products damage to our reputation lost revenue diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and increases in customer service and support costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

furthermore defective components may give rise to warranty indemnity or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive from the affected products we offer a minimum 12year limited warranty for our inverters and a 25year limited warranty for our power optimizers our limited warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship of our products under normal use and service conditions as a result we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold products and recognized revenue while we do have accrued reserves for warranty claims our estimated warranty costs for previously sold products may change to the extent future products are not compatible with earlier generation products under warranty our warranty accruals are based on our assumptions and we do not have a long history of making such assumptions as a result these assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our systems causing us to incur substantial unanticipated expense to repair or replace defective products in the future or to compensate customers for defective products our failure to accurately predict future claims could result in unexpected volatility in and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

 

if one of our products were to cause injury to someone or cause property damage including as a result of product malfunctions defects or improper installation then we could be exposed to product liability claims we could incur significant costs and liabilities if we are sued and if damages are awarded against us further any product liability claim we face could be expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention the successful assertion of a product liability claim against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages penalties or fines subject us to adverse publicity damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely affect sales of our products in addition product liability claims injuries defects or other problems experienced by other companies in the residential solar industry could lead to unfavorable market conditions for the industry as a whole and may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract new customers thus harming our growth and financial performance

 

if we do not forecast demand for our products accurately we may experience product shortages delays in product shipment excess product inventory or difficulties in planning expenses which will adversely affect our business and financial condition

 

our products are manufactured according to our estimates of customer demand which requires us to make multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to demand from solar pv installers and distributors their end customers and general market conditions because we sell a large portion of our products to larger solar installers and various distributors who in turn sell to local installers who in turn sell to their end customers the system owner we have limited visibility as to end customer demand and it is difficult to forecast future enduser demand to plan our operations if we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are cancelled or shipments are delayed we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell conversely if we underestimate demand we may not have sufficient inventory to meet end customer demand or to ramp up production at our contract manufacturers in a timely manner or we could incur additional costs lose market share damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forego potential revenue opportunities for example in fiscal 2014 unexpectedly high customer demand forced us to shorten transportation time from our factories in china and hungary by using air freight rather than less expensive ocean freight

 

 

we are dependent on ocean transportation to deliver our products in a cost efficient manner if we are unable to use ocean transportation to deliver our products our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted

 

we rely on commercial ocean transportation for the delivery of a large percentage of our products to our customers in north america we also rely on more expensive air transportation when ocean transportation is not available or compatible with the delivery time requirements of our customers our ability to deliver our products via ocean transportation could be adversely impacted by shortages in available cargo capacity changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling pricing payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel taxes and labor and other factors such as labor strikes and work stoppages not within our control if we are unable to use ocean transportation and are required to substitute more expensive air transportation our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted in the first calendar quarter of 2015 contentious negotiations between the pacific maritime association and the international longshore  warehouse union resulted in port slowdowns caused port congestion and major delays in the transfer of cargo in the united states west coast accordingly in the quarter ended march 31 2015 we shipped a higher percentage of our products to our customers in north america via air transportation material interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation such as the aforementioned dispute whether caused by strike work stoppage lockout slowdown or otherwise could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition

 

we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers

 

we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and currently rely upon two contract manufacturers to build all of our products our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs

 

the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues as a result fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner in addition the facilities in which our products are manufactured are located outside of the us currently in china and hungary the location of these facilities outside of key markets such as the us increases shipping time thereby causing a long lead time between manufacturing and delivery

 

if any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers an alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms including price any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers or increase our shipping costs to make up for delays in manufacturing which in turn could reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers and damage our reputation with local installers and potential endusers and cause us to forego potential revenue opportunities

 

we may experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations

 

our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise such processes involve a number of precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched identified and properly addressed and rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques andor expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased warranty reserve increased production and logistics costs and delays any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for key components and raw materials in our products to adequately meet anticipated demand due to the limited number of such suppliers any cessation of operations or production or any shortage delay price change imposition of tariffs or duties or other limitation on our ability to obtain the components and raw materials we use could result in sales delays cancellations and loss of market share

 

we depend on limited or single source suppliers for certain key components and raw materials used to manufacture our products making us susceptible to quality issues shortages and price changes any of these limited or single source suppliers could stop producing our components or supplying our raw materials cease operations or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with one or more of our competitors as a result these suppliers could stop selling to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all because there are a limited number of suppliers of solar pv system components and raw materials used to manufacture our products it may be difficult to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative components or raw materials on commercially reasonable terms and our ability to satisfy customer demand may be adversely affected transitioning to a new supplier or redesigning a product to accommodate a new component manufacturer would result in additional costs and delays these outcomes could harm our business or financial performance

 

 

any interruption in the supply of limited source components or raw materials for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers could result in lost revenue or higher expenses and would harm our business

 

failure by our contract manufacturers or our component or raw material suppliers to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations may adversely affect our business

 

we do not control our contract manufacturers or suppliers or their business practices accordingly we cannot guarantee that they follow ethical business practices such as fair wage practices and compliance with environmental safety and other local laws a lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative manufacturers or suppliers which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products product shortages or other disruptions of our operations violation of labor or other laws by our manufacturers or suppliers or the divergence of a supplier’s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the us or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and harm our business

 

our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter which could make our future performance difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations for a particular period to fall below expectations resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock

 

our quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the future we have experienced seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in the past as a result of seasonal fluctuations in our customers’ business for example our customers’ and endusers’ ability to install solar energy systems is affected by weather as for example during the winter months in europe and the northeastern us such installation delays can impact the timing of orders for our products further given that we are an earlystage company operating in a rapidly growing industry the true extent of these fluctuations may have been masked by our recent growth rates and consequently may not be readily apparent from our historical results of operations and may be difficult to predict our financial performance sales working capital requirements and cash flow may fluctuate and our past quarterly results of operations may not be good indicators of future performance any substantial decrease in revenues would have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price

 

we rely on distributors and large installers to assist in selling our products and the failure of these customers to perform as expected could reduce our future revenue

 

we currently sell a substantial percentage of our products through distributors who in turn sell to local installers and through direct sales to large installers we do not have exclusive arrangements with these third party distributors and large installers many of our distributors also market and sell products from our competitors and all of our large installer customers also use products from our competitors these distributors and large installers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and with little or no notice further these distributors and large installers may fail to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors termination of agreements with current distributors or large installers failure by these distributors or large installers to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new distributor or large installer relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and results of operations

if we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer

 

our future success and ability to implement our business strategy depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team and key technical personnel each of whom would be difficult to replace all of our employees including our senior management are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time competition for highly skilled individuals with technical expertise is extremely intense and we face challenges identifying hiring and retaining qualified personnel in many areas of our business integrating new employees into our team could prove disruptive to our operations require substantial resources and management attention and ultimately prove unsuccessful an inability to retain our senior management and other key personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel could limit or delay our strategic efforts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects

 

 

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management’s attention

 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” the listing requirements of the nasdaq global select market and other applicable securities rules and regulations compliance with these rules and regulations requires significant legal and financial compliance and demands on our systems and resources and makes some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly than if we were a private company as certain additional securities rules and regulations become applicable to us our legal and financial compliance costs may increase the exchange act requires among other things that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to maintain and if required improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard significant resources and management oversight are required as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could harm our business and results of operations we may need to hire more employees in the future which would increase our costs and expenses

 

if we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our business and results of operations could be materially harmed

 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and unfair competition laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we have applied for patents in the us europe and china some of which have been issued we cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology and any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to among other things rebrand or redesign our affected products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the us we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated infringed or otherwise violated

 

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert management’s attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate

 

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry from time to time we may also be subject to claims of intellectual property right infringement and related litigation and if we gain greater recognition in the market we face a higher risk of being the subject of claims that we have violated others’ intellectual property rights regardless of their merit responding to such claims can be time consuming can divert management’s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses in litigation or settlement while we believe that our products and technology do not infringe in any material respect upon any valid intellectual property rights of third parties we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims if we do not successfully defend or settle an intellectual property claim we could be liable for significant monetary damages and could be prohibited from continuing to use certain technology business methods content or brands to avoid a prohibition we could seek a license from the applicable third party which could require us to pay significant royalties increasing our operating expenses if a license is not available at all or not available on reasonable terms we may be required to develop or license a nonviolating alternative either of which could require significant effort and expense if we cannot license or develop a nonviolating alternative we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our offerings and may be unable to effectively compete any of these results would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees which could result in litigation and adversely affect our business

 

we enter into agreements with our employees pursuant to which they agree that any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement are assigned to us or owned exclusively by us depending on the jurisdiction without the employee retaining any rights a significant portion of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees in the course of their employment for us under the israeli patent law 57271967 the “patent law” inventions conceived by an employee during the scope of his or her employment with a company are regarded as “service inventions” which belong to the employer absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer giving the employee service invention rights the patent law also provides that if there is no such agreement between an employer and an employee the israeli compensation and royalties committee the “committee” a body constituted under the patent law shall determine whether the employee is entitled to remuneration for his or her inventions recent decisions by the committee and the israeli supreme court have created uncertainty in this area as the israeli supreme court held that employees may be entitled to remuneration for their service inventions despite having specifically waived any such rights further the committee has not yet determined the method for calculating this committeeenforced remuneration although our employees have agreed that any rights related to their inventions are owned exclusively by us we may face claims demanding remuneration in consideration for such acknowledgement as a consequence of such claims we could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to our current andor former employees or be forced to litigate such claims which could negatively affect our business

 

 

the loss of or events affecting one of our major customers could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

for fiscal 2016 three of our major customers in the us together accounted for 325 of our revenues our next five largest customers for fiscal 2016 together accounted for 22  of our revenues our customers’ decisions to purchase our products are influenced by a number of factors outside of our control including retail energy prices and government regulation and incentives among others in addition these customers may decide to no longer use our products and services for other reasons which may be out of our control although we have agreements with some of our largest customers these agreements do not have longterm purchase commitments and are generally terminable by either party after a relatively short notice period the loss of or events affecting one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example in april 2016 one of our customers sunedison suneq filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy laws

consolidations in the solar industry among our current or potential customers or distributors may adversely affect our competitive position    

 

    there has been an increase in consolidation activity among distributors large installers and other strategic partners in the solar industry for example in july 2016 sunedison suneq announced its intention to purchase vivint solar for 2 billion in march 2016 vivint solar announced it is terminating the merger due to sunedison’s “willful breach of the merger agreement” in june 2016 tesla motors tsla announced that it has submitted a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of solarcity corporation scty this trend could further increase our reliance on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales and may negatively impact our competitive position in the solar market

our planned expansion into new markets could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks

 

in fiscal 2016 we sold our products to approximately 220 direct customers in 45 countries including the us canada belgium france germany israel italy the netherlands the united kingdom australia japan and china we intend to introduce new products targeted at large commercial and utilityscale installations and to expand into other international markets our success in these new product and geographic markets will depend on a number of factors including our ability to develop solutions to address the requirements of the large commercial and utilityscale solar pv markets timely qualification and certification of new products for large commercial and utilityscale solar pv installations acceptance of power optimizers in solar pv markets in which they have not traditionally been used and our ability to manage increased manufacturing capacity and production

 

further these solar pv markets have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products and our success will depend on our ability to adapt properly to these differences these differences may include differing regulatory requirements including tax laws trade laws labor regulations tariffs export quotas customs duties or other trade restrictions limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection international political or economic conditions restrictions on the repatriation of earnings longer sales cycles warranty expectations product return policies and cost performance and compatibility requirements in addition expanding into new geographic markets will increase our exposure to presently existing risks such as fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and difficulties and increased expenses in complying with us and foreign laws regulations and trade standards including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa”

 

failure to develop and introduce these new products successfully or to otherwise manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to sustain profitability

 

 

if we fail to manage our recent and future growth effectively we may be unable to execute our business plan maintain high levels of customer service or adequately address competitive challenges

 

we have experienced significant growth in recent periods with our annual product sales growing rapidly from approximately 8400 inverters and approximately 181000 power optimizers in fiscal 2011 our first full fiscal year of commercial shipments to annual product sales exceeding 224000 inverters and 57 million power optimizers in fiscal 2016 we intend to continue to expand our business significantly within existing and new markets this growth has placed and any future growth may place a significant strain on our management operational and financial infrastructure in particular we will be required to expand train and manage our growing employee base and scale and otherwise improve our it infrastructure in tandem with that headcount growth our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers as well as manage multiple geographic locations

 

our current and planned operations personnel it and other systems and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth and may require us to make additional unanticipated investment in our infrastructure our success and ability to further scale our business will depend in part on our ability to manage these changes in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot manage our growth we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures this could also result in declines in quality or customer satisfaction increased costs difficulties in introducing new offerings or other operational difficulties any failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our business and reputation

 

covenants in our credit facility may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities and competitive developments and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions

 

we have a revolving line of credit from silicon valley bank “svb” the svb credit facility restricts our ability to take certain actions such as borrow money grant liens pay dividends dispose of assets or engage in certain transactions our credit agreement with svb also requires us to maintain certain ebitda and liquidity levels these restrictions may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities competitive developments and adverse economic or industry conditions in addition our obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets including all of our intellectual property which limits our ability to provide collateral for additional financing nevertheless we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future and any debt instrument we enter into in the future may contain similar restrictions or collateral packages a breach of any of these covenants or a failure to pay principal or interest when due could result in a variety of adverse consequences including the acceleration of our indebtedness our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings if some or all of our indebtedness is accelerated acceleration could result in the foreclosure by the lenders on our assets that secure the credit facility

 

furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into new debt instruments on acceptable terms if we are unable to satisfy financial covenants and other terms under existing or new credit arrangements or obtain waivers or forbearance from our lenders or if we are unable to obtain refinancing or new financings for our working capital equipment and other needs on acceptable terms if and when needed our business would be adversely affected

 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations

 

although our financial results are reported in us dollars us dollar revenues accounted for 760  of our revenues in fiscal 2016 in addition a significant portion of our operating expenses are accrued in new israeli shekels primarily related to payroll and to a lesser extent the euro and other currencies our profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and to a lesser extent the new israeli shekel and other currencies in which we generate revenues incur expenses and maintain cash balances foreign currency fluctuations may also affect the prices of our products our prices are denominated primarily in us dollars if there is a significant devaluation of a particular currency the prices of our products will increase relative to the local currency and may be less competitive despite our efforts to minimize foreign currency risks primarily by entering into forward hedging transactions to sell euro for us dollars at a predefined rate and maintaining cash balances in new israeli shekels significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values in particular a significant change in the relative values of the euro and to a lesser extent the new israeli shekel and other currencies against the us dollar could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition

 

 

any unauthorized access to or disclosure or theft of personal information we gather store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation

 

we receive store and use certain personal information of our customers and the endusers of our customers’ solar pv systems including names addresses email addresses credit information and energy production statistics we also store and use personal information of our employees we take steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the personal information we collect store and transmit but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we and our suppliers or vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures

 

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee or contractor error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information were to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws

 

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws however we currently operate in and intend to further expand into many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our entry into certain jurisdictions requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from us standards it is possible that our employees subcontractors agents and partners may take actions in violation of our policies and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us to criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation

 

risks related to operations in israel

 

conditions in israel affect our operations and may limit our ability to develop produce and sell our products

 

although we are incorporated in delaware our headquarters and research and development center are located in israel accordingly political economic and military conditions in israel directly affect us israel has been involved in a number of armed conflicts and has been the target of terrorist activity ongoing state of hostility varying in degree such as rocket fire from the gaza strip including against civilian targets has occurred on an irregular basis disrupting daytoday civilian activity and negatively affecting business conditions israel also faces threats from hezbollah militants in lebanon and others we cannot predict whether or when such armed conflicts or attacks may occur or the extent to which such events may impact us any future armed conflict political instability or violence in the region may impede our ability to manage our business effectively or to engage in research and development or may otherwise adversely affect our business or operations in the event of war we and our israeli subcontractors and suppliers may cease operations which may cause delays in the distribution and sale of our products some of our directors executive officers and employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and are subject to being called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances in the event that our principal executive office is damaged as a result of hostile action or hostilities otherwise disrupting the ongoing operation of our offices our ability to operate could be materially adversely affected

 

additionally several countries principally in the middle east restrict doing business with israeli companies and additional countries and groups may impose similar restrictions if hostilities in israel or political instability in the region continue or increase if recent regime changes and civil wars in neighboring states result in the establishment of fundamentalist islamic regimes or governments more hostile to israel or if egypt or jordan abrogates its respective peace treaty with israel israel could be subject to additional political economic and military confines and our operations and ability to sell our products to countries in the region could be materially adversely affected these restrictions may limit materially our ability to obtain manufactured components and raw materials or to sell our products

 

 

any hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners or significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

the tax benefits that are available to us under israeli law require us to meet various conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future which could increase our costs and taxes

 

our israeli subsidiary is eligible for certain tax benefits provided to “benefited enterprises” under the israeli law for the encouragement of capital investments 1959 the “investment law” in order to remain eligible for the tax benefits for “benefited enterprises” we must continue to meet certain conditions stipulated in the investment law and its regulations as amended if these tax benefits are reduced cancelled or discontinued our israeli taxable income would be subject to regular israeli corporate tax rates and we may be required to refund any tax benefits that we have already received plus interest and penalties thereon the standard corporate tax rate for israeli companies was increased to 265 in 2014 and 2015 and decreased back to 25 in 2016 and thereafter additionally if we increase our activities outside of israel through acquisitions for example our expanded activities might not be eligible for inclusion in future israeli tax benefit programs the israeli government may furthermore independently determine to reduce phase out or eliminate entirely the benefit programs under the investment law regardless of whether we then qualify for benefits under those programs at the time which would also adversely affect our global tax rate and our results of operations

 

the terms of israeli government grants that we have received restrict our ability to transfer technologies outside of israel and we may be required to pay penalties in such a case or upon the sale of our company

 

in fiscal 2016 we received a total of 02 million from the office of the chief scientist in the israel ministry of economy “ocs” we do not expect to receive additional grants from the ocs in fiscal 2016 the terms of the previous grants require us to pay royalties at a rate of 4 to 45 on sales of products developed under these grants up to the total grant amount linked to the us dollar and bearing interest at an annual rate of libor applicable to dollar deposits even after payment in full we will still be required to comply with the requirements of the israeli encouragement of industrial research and development law 1984 the “rd law” and related regulations with respect to those past grants when a company develops knowhow technology or products under an ocs grant the grant terms and the rd law restrict the transfer outside of israel of such knowhow without the prior approval of the ocs consequently if aspects of our technologies are deemed to have been developed with ocs funding the discretionary approval of an ocs committee would be required for any transfer to third parties outside of israel of knowhow related to those aspects of our technologies the ocs may impose conditions on any arrangement under which it permits us to transfer technology or development out of israel or may not grant such approval at all

 

any transfer of ocssupported technology or knowhow outside of israel may require payment of significant amounts to the ocs depending on the value of the transferred technology or knowhow the amount of ocs support the time of completion of the ocssupported research project and other factors these restrictions and requirements for payment may impair our ability to sell our technology assets outside of israel furthermore the consideration available to our shareholders in a transaction involving the transfer outside of israel of technology or knowhow developed with ocs funding such as a merger or similar transaction would be reduced by any amounts that we are required to pay to the ocs

 

it may be difficult to enforce a judgment of a us court against our officers and directors to assert us securities laws claims in israel or to serve process on our officers and directors

 

the majority of our directors and executive officers reside outside of the us and most of our assets and most of the assets of these persons are located outside of the us consequently a judgment obtained against any of these persons including a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws may not be collectible in the us it also may be difficult for you to effect service of process on these persons in the us or to assert us securities law claims in original actions instituted in israel israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of us securities laws on the grounds that israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim in addition even if an israeli court hears a claim it may determine that israeli law and not us law is applicable to the claim if us law is found to be applicable the content of applicable us law must be proven as a fact by expert witnesses which can be a time consuming and costly process further an israeli court may not enforce a judgment awarded by a us or other nonisraeli court certain matters of procedure will also be governed by israeli law there is little binding case law in israel that addresses these matters as a result of the difficulty associated with enforcing a judgment against any of these persons in israel you may not be able to obtain or enforce a judgment against many of our directors and executive officers

 

 

risks related to the ownership of our common stock

 

we cannot assure you that our stock price will not decline or not be subject to significant volatility

 

the trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in march 2015 at a price of 1800 per share during fiscal year 2016 the reported high and low prices of our common stock has ranged from 1502 to 3811 per share the price of our stock may change in response to fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods and also may change in response to other factors including factors specific to companies in our industry many of which are beyond our control as a result our share price may experience significant volatility and may not necessarily reflect the value of our expected performance among other factors that could affect our stock price are

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  further the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies in addition the stock prices of many renewable energy companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial cost and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business

 

 

 

the price of our common stock could decline if securities analysts or other third parties publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or if one or more of our analysts ceases to cover us or to regularly publish reports about us

 

the trading of our common stock is likely to be influenced by the reports and research that industry or securities analysts publish about us our business our market or our competitors if one or more securities or industry analysts downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price would likely decline if one or more securities or industry analysts ceases to cover the company or fails to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline

 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management

 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may believe advantageous these provisions include

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” which generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder becomes an “interested” stockholder

 

 

our certificate of incorporation includes a forum selection clause which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us

 

our certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder including any beneficial owner to bring i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or employees to us or to our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or iv any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine will be a state court located within the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware in all cases subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions this forum selection provision may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us it is also possible that notwithstanding the forum selection clause that is included in our certificate of incorporation a court outside of delaware could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable

 

we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future

 

we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors subject to applicable laws and provisions of our debt instruments and organizational documents after taking into account our financial condition results of operations capital requirements general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant as a result capital appreciation in the price of our common stock if any may be your only source of gain on an investment in our common stock

 

if we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls we may not be able to report our financial results accurately which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and timeconsuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and requires attestations of the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors we need to implement substantial control systems and procedures in order to satisfy the reporting requirements under the exchange act and applicable nasdaq global select market requirements among other items establishing these internal controls will be costly and may divert management’s attention

 

evaluation by us of our internal controls over financial reporting may identify material weaknesses that may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences including sanctions by the sec or violations of nasdaq global select market rules there also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and could also lead to a decline in the price of our common stock

overview

 

we are a leading provider of intelligent inverter solutions that are changing the way power is harvested and managed in solar pv systems our dc optimized inverter solution maximizes power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system our systems allow for superior power harvesting and module management by deploying power optimizers at each pv module while maintaining a competitive system cost by using a simplified dcac inverter our systems are monitored through our cloudbased monitoring platform that enables lower system operating and maintenance “om” costs we believe that these benefits along with our comprehensive and advanced safety features are highly valued by our customers

 

we are a leader in the global module level power electronics “mlpe” market according to gtm research and as of june 30 2016 we have shipped approximately 125 million power optimizers and 513000 inverters approximately 265000 installations many of which may include multiple inverters are currently connected to and monitored through our cloudbased monitoring platform as of june 30 2016 we have shipped approximately 34 gw of our dc optimized inverter systems our products have sold in approximately 55 countries and are installed in solar pv systems in 96 countries

 

we primarily sell our products directly to large solar installers epcs and indirectly to thousands of smaller solar installers through large distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers our sales strategy focuses on toptier customers in markets where electricity prices irradiance amount of sunlight and government policies make solar pv installations economically viable we also sell our power optimizers to several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules

 

in fiscal 2016 we sold our products to approximately 220 direct customers in 45 countries and as of june 30 2016 approximately 163989 indirect customers had registered with us through our cloudbased monitoring platform in fiscal 2016 three customers accounted for revenues of above 10 each together comprising an aggregate of 325 of our sales of these customers two are distributors

 

we were founded in 2006 with the goal of addressing the lost power generation potential that is inherent in the use of traditional solar pv inverter technology thereby increasing the return on investment in solar pv systems the following is a chronology of some of our key milestones

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have achieved substantial growth since we commenced commercial shipments in fiscal 2010 our revenues were 1332 million 3251 million and 4898 million for fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively gross margins were 165 252 and 310 for fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively net loss was  214 million for fiscal 2014 and net profits were 211 million and 766 million for fiscal 2015 and 2016 respectively

 

we continue to focus on our longterm growth we believe that our market opportunity is large and that the transition from traditional inverter architecture to dc optimized inverter architecture as the architecture of choice for distributed solar installations globally will continue we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this market trend we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to acquire new customers in our existing markets grow internationally and drive additional revenue we also plan to expand our product offerings to further penetrate the large commercial and utility segments we expect to continue to invest in research and development to enhance our product offerings and develop new cost effective solutions

 

we believe that our strategy results in a lean operating base with low expenses that will enable profitability on lower revenues relative to our competitors we believe that our sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the longterm as we continue to grow due to economies of scale with this increased operating leverage we expect our gross and operating margins to increase in the longterm

 

performance measures

 

in managing our business and assessing financial performance we supplement the information provided by the financial statements with other operating metrics these operating metrics are utilized by our management to evaluate our business measure our performance identify trends affecting our business and formulate projections we use metrics relating to yearly shipments inverters shipped power optimizers shipped and megawatts shipped to evaluate our sales performance and to track market acceptance of our products from year to year we use metrics relating to monitoring systems monitored and megawatts monitored to evaluate market acceptance of our products and usage of our solution

 

we provide the “megawatts shipped” metric which is calculated based on nameplate capacity shipped to show adoption of our system on a nameplate capacity basis nameplate capacity shipped is the maximum rated power output capacity of an inverter and corresponds to our financial results in that higher total capacities shipped are generally associated with higher total revenues however revenues increase with each additional unit not necessarily each additional mw of capacity sold accordingly we also provide the “inverters shipped” and “power optimizers shipped” operating metrics

 

key components of our results of operations

 

the following discussion describes certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations

 

 

revenues

 

we generate revenues from the sale of dc optimized inverter systems for solar pv installations which include power optimizers inverters and our cloudbased monitoring platform our customer base includes large solar installers distributors wholesalers epcs and pv module manufacturers

 

our revenues are affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our dc optimized inverter systems the volume and average selling price of our systems is driven by the supply and demand for our products changes in the product mix between our residential and commercial products the customer mix between large and small customers the geographical mix of our sales sales incentives enduser government incentives seasonality and competitive product offerings

 

our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to expand our market share in each of the geographies in which we compete expand our global footprint to new evolving markets grow our production capabilities to meet demand and to continue to develop and introduce new and innovative products that address the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers

 

cost of revenues and gross profit

 

cost of revenues consists primarily of product costs including purchases from our contract manufacturers and other suppliers as well as costs related to shipping customer support product warranty personnel depreciation of test and manufacturing equipment hosting services for our cloudbased monitoring platform and other logistics services our product costs are affected by technological innovations such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions economies of scale resulting in lower component costs and improvements in production processes and automation some of these costs primarily personnel and depreciation of test and manufacturing equipment are not directly affected by sales volume

 

we outsource our manufacturing to thirdparty manufacturers and negotiate product pricing on a quarterly basis our thirdparty manufacturers are responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products except with regard to end of line testing equipment and the automated assembly lines for our power optimizers as further described below which resulted in capital expenditures of 28 million and 52 million for fiscal 2015 and 2016 respectively we expect to continue this funding arrangement in the future with respect to any expansions to such existing lines we also procure strategic and critical components from various approved vendors on behalf of our contract manufacturers at times higher than anticipated demand has exceeded the production capacities of these manufacturers in 2014 and early 2015 for example such production shortfalls as well as shortages in the supply of certain raw materials required us to use air freight rather than less expensive ocean freight to deliver the majority of our products the expansion of current manufacturing sites by our contract manufacturers allowed us to reduce these expenses in fiscal 2015 as well as to build sufficient inventory to continue our growth without the need to ship substantial amounts of products by air in 2016 we managed to continuously increase the efficiency of our supply chain reduce our reliance on air freight to a minimum and use ocean freight for the majority of our shipments we believe that continued expansion of the current manufacturing sites by our contract manufacturers and the development and deployment of our proprietary automated assembly line described below will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our forecasted demands with minimal shipment of products by air freight

 

we completed development of our first proprietary automated assembly line for our power optimizers and have ordered an additional four lines for the automated manufacturing of our power optimizers we expect to continue to invest in additional automated assembly lines in the future we have designed and are responsible for funding all of the capital expenses associated with existing and future automated assembly lines the current and expected capital expenses associated with these automated assembly lines will be funded out of our cash flows

 

key components of our logistics supply channel consist of third party distribution centers in the us and europe finished goods are either shipped to our customers directly from our contract manufacturers or shipped to third party distribution centers and then finally shipped to our customers

 

cost of revenues also includes our operations and support departments’ costs the operations department is responsible for production management such as planning procurement supply chain production methodologies and machinery planning logistics management and manufacturing support to our contract manufacturers as well as the quality assurance of our products our support department provides customer and technical support at various levels through our call centers around the world as well as second and third level support services which are provided by support personnel located in our headquarters our fulltime employee headcount in our operations and support departments has grown from 57 as of june 30 2014 to 106 as of june 30 2015 to 175 as of june 30 2016

 

gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices product costs product mix customer mix geographical mix shipping method warranty costs and seasonality

 

 

operating expenses

 

operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnelrelated costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories and include salaries benefits payroll taxes commissions and stockbased compensation our fulltime employee headcount in our research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative departments has grown from 239 as of june 30 2014 to 334 as of june 30 2015 to 434 as of june 30 2016 we expect to continue to hire significant numbers of new employees to support our growth the timing of these additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses in any particular period both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue we expect to continue to invest substantial resources to support our growth and anticipate that each of the following categories of operating expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts for the foreseeable future

debt obligations

in february 2015 we amended and restated an agreement with svb for a revolving line of credit which permits aggregate borrowings of up to 40 million in an amount not to exceed 80 of the eligible accounts receivable and bears interest payable monthly at svb’s prime rate plus a margin of 05 to 20 the revolving line of credit will terminate and outstanding borrowings will be payable on december 31 2016 as of june 30 2016 we had no outstanding borrowings under our 40 million revolving line of credit with svb

 

in connection with the amended and restated revolving line of credit we granted svb security interests in substantially all of our assets including a firstpriority security interest in our trade receivables cash and cash equivalents the “svb priority collateral” the agreement contains certain financial covenants requiring us to maintain ebitda and liquidity at specified levels specifically we are required to maintain negative adjusted ebitda defined in accordance with us gaap as a net income plus b the extent deducted in the calculation of net income interest taxes depreciation and amortization plus c to the extent deducted in the calculation of net income noncash stockbased compensation of no greater than 1500000 as of march 31 2015 and positive adjusted ebitda of at least i 1500000 as of june 30 2015 ii 3500000 as of september 30 2015 and december 31 2015 iii 1500000 as of march 31 2016 and iv 3500000 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 and for each calendar quarter thereafter in addition we are required to maintain liquidity defined as our unrestricted and unencumbered cash plus availability under the revolving line of credit of 6750000 the amended and restated revolving line of credit also contains covenants that restrict our ability to borrow money grant liens pay dividends dispose of assets or engage in business combinations as of june 30 2016 the company met all covenants related to this revolving credit line

 

 

 

 

on december 28 2012 we entered into a term loan agreement with kreos providing for a term loan of up to 10 million which was fully drawn on the closing date the borrowings under the term loan were primarily used to finance working capital needs on january 26 2015 we repaid the entire outstanding balance of the kreos term loan

contractual obligations

 

the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30 2016

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements

 

in fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements

 

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates

 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “gaap” the preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain

 

 

revenue recognition

 

we generate revenues from the sale of dc optimized inverter systems for solar pv installations which include our power optimizers inverters and cloudbased monitoring platform our worldwide customer base includes large solar installers distributors epcs and pv module manufacturers our products are fully functional at the time of shipment to the customer and do not require production modification or customization we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred iii the price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured provisions for rebates sales incentives and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded

 

we generally sell our products to our customers pursuant to a customer’s standard purchase order and our customary terms and conditions we do not offer rights to return our products other than for normal warranty conditions and as such revenue is recorded upon shipment of products to customers and transfer of title and risk of loss under standard commercial terms we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine that appropriate credit limits are established prior to the acceptance and shipment of an order

 

prior to may 2013 we provided our full webbased monitoring platform free of charge for a limited period of time after which the customer could elect whether to continue and receive a basic service for free or subscribe for a full line of services revenues associated with our webbased monitoring platform were recognized ratably over the term of 18 to 36 months the free of charge period and revenues associated with the basic functionality were recognized ratably over 25 years since may 2013 we have provided our full webbased monitoring platform free of charge and revenues associated with the service since that date are being recognized ratably over 25 years in the absence of vendorspecific objective evidence or third party comparable pricing for such service management determines the revenue levels of this service based on the costs associated with providing the service plus appropriate margins that reflect management’s best estimate of the selling price since may 2013 these revenues were minimal and we do not expect this to become a significant source of revenue in the near future

 

product warranty

 

we provide a standard limited product warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions our standard warranty period is 25 years for our power optimizers 12 years for our inverters and 10 years for our storage interface in certain cases customers can purchase extended warranties for inverters that increase the warranty period to up to 25 years

 

our products are designed to meet the warranty periods and our reliability procedures cover component selection design accelerated life cycle tests and end of manufacturing line testing however since our history in selling power optimizers and inverters is substantially shorter than the warranty period the calculation of warranty provisions is inherently uncertain

 

we accrue for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based on anticipated warranty claims and actual historical warranty claims experience warranty provisions are computed on a perunit sold basis are based on our best estimate of such costs and are included in our cost of revenues the warranty obligation is determined based on actual and predicted failure rates of the products cost of replacement and service and delivery costs incurred to correct a product failure our warranty obligation requires management to make assumptions regarding estimated failure rates and replacement costs

 

in order to predict the failure rate of each of our products we have established a reliability model based on the estimated mean time between failures “mtbf” the mtbf represents the average elapsed time predicted for each product unit between failures during operation applying the mtbf failure rate over our install base for each product type and generation allows us to predict the number of failed units over the warranty period and estimates the costs associated with the product warranty predicted failure rates are updated periodically based on data returned from the field and new product versions as are replacement costs which are updated to reflect changes in our actual production costs for our products labor costs and actual logistics costs

 

 

since the mtbf model does not take into account additional nonsystematic failures such as failures caused by workmanship or manufacturing or designrelated issues and since warranty claims are at times opened for cases in which the error has been triggered by an improper installation we have developed a supplemental model to predict such cases and recognize the associated expenses ratably over the expected claim period this model which is based on actual root cause analysis of returned products identification of the causes of claims and time until each identified problem is revealed allows us to better predict actual warranty expenses and is updated periodically based on our experience taking into account the installed base of approximately 125 million power optimizers and approximately 513000 inverters as of june 30 2016

 

if actual warranty costs differ significantly from these estimates adjustments may be required in the future which could adversely affect our gross profit and results of operations warranty obligations are classified as short term and long term warranty obligations based on the period in which the warranty is expected to be claimed the warranty provision short and long term was 182 million 319 million and 512 million in fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively

 

inventory valuation

 

our inventories comprise sellable finished goods raw materials bought on behalf of our contract manufacturers and faulty units returned under our warranty policy

 

sellable finished goods and raw material inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based on the moving average cost method certain factors could affect the realizable value of our inventories including market and economic conditions technological changes existing product changes mainly due to cost reduction activities and new product introductions we consider historic usage expected demand anticipated sales price the effect of new product introductions product obsolescence product merchantability and other factors when evaluating the value of inventories inventory writedowns are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and their estimated fair market value inventory writedowns are recorded as cost of revenues in the accompanying statements of operations and were 11 million 10 million and 25 million in fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively

 

faulty products returned under our warranty policy are often refurbished and used as replacement units in warranty cases as we do not yet have sufficient history of refurbish utilization rates such products are written off upon receipt

 

we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that we use to record inventory at the lower of cost or market however if estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner we may be exposed to losses that could be material

we account for stockbased compensation granted to employees nonemployee directors and independent contractors in accordance with asc 718 “compensation — stock compensation” and asc 50550 “equitybased payments to nonemployees” which require the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stockbased payment awards based on fair value

 

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model the stockbased compensation expense net of forfeitures is recognized using a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award which is generally four years estimated forfeitures are based on actual historical prevesting forfeitures

 

 

 

the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the fair value of the underlying common stock the expected volatility of the price of our common stock the expected term of the option riskfree interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment if factors change and different assumptions are used our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future these assumptions are estimated as follows

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of the assumptions used in the blackscholesmerton model change significantly future stockbased compensation awards for employees may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously

 

the following table presents the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted to employees during the periods presented

 

 

 

during fiscal 2014 2015 and 2016 we incurred a noncash stockbased compensation expense of 1082000 2956000 and 9044000 respectively we expect to continue to grant stock options in the future and to the extent that we do our actual sharebased compensation expense for employees and consultants recognized will likely increase

 item 7a quant itative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates customer concentrations and interest rates we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes

 

foreign currency exchange risk

 

approximately 318 and 220 of our revenues for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 respectively were earned in nonus dollar denominated currencies principally the euro our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located primarily the us dollar and new israeli shekel and to a lesser extent the euro and british pound sterling our new israeli shekeldenominated expenses consist primarily of personnel and overhead costs our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 95 million for fiscal 2016 a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the new israeli shekel and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 32 million for fiscal 2016

 

for purposes of our consolidated financial statements local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the us dollar on the balance sheet date and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rate as of the date of the transaction or at the average exchange rate to the us dollar during the reporting period

 

to date we have used derivative financial instruments specifically foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign currency risks by hedging a portion of our account receivable balances denominated in euros expected to be paid within six months our foreign currency forward contracts are expected to mitigate exchange rate changes related to the hedged assets we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes

 

we had cash and cash equivalents of 98 million 1448 million and 740 million at june 30 2014 june 30 2015 and june 30 2016 respectively which was held for working capital purposes in addition we had availableforsale marketable securities with an estimated fair value of 1116 million on june 30 2016  since most of our investments and cash and cash equivalents are held in us dollardenominated money market funds we believe that our cash and cash equivalents do not have any material exposure to changes in exchange rates

 

interest rate risk

 

as of june 30 2016 we had no outstanding borrowings

 

concentrations of major customers

 

our trade accounts receivables potentially expose us to a concentration of credit risk with our major customers for fiscal 2016 three major customers accounted for 325 of total revenues and as of june 30 2016 these same customers accounted for approximately 354 of our consolidated trade receivables balance we currently do not foresee a credit risk associated with these receivables in fiscal 2015 and 2014 one major customer accounted for 246 and 191 of our total revenues respectively

 

inflation

 

we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the last three years if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

 

commodity price risk

 

we are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials including copper which are used in our products prices of these raw materials may be affected by supply restrictions or other market factors from time to time and we do not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate commodity risk significant price changes for these raw materials could reduce our operating margins if we are unable to recover such increases from our customers and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

disclosure controls and procedures

 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of june 30 2016 in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs

 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles

 

management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2016 the end of our 2016 fiscal year management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework management’s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment

 

based on this assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors

 

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young independently assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in the firm’s attestation report which is incorporated by reference into part ii item 8 of this form 10k

 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how welldesigned and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

changes in internal control over financial reporting

 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

these guiding principles apply to all of our executive pay practices discussed

 

compensation governance highlights

 

in addition to aligning pay with performance our executive compensation program is intended to be consistent with corporate governance best practices this is demonstrated by the following elements in our 2016 executive officer compensation arrangements

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2016 results and key events and impact on compensation

 

the company’s performance in fiscal 2016 was significantly better than fiscal 2015 in all parameters our revenues grew from 3251 million in fiscal 2015 to 4898 million in fiscal 2016 gross margins also grew from 252 in fiscal 2015 to 310 in fiscal 2016 our net profits were 211 million in fiscal 2015 and 766 million for fiscal 2016 in addition the company generated 524 million in cash from operating activities for the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 in fiscal 2016 we also introduced a new inverter technology the hd wave which embodies a new power conversion topology that the company believes is one of the most significant leaps in solar technology in the past 20 years the company also announced the commercial availability of products for storage solutions that are compatible with leading home battery manufacturers

 

in line with our emphasis on payforperformance and our performance relative to our peers compensation awarded to our named executive officers “neos” for 2016 reflected our positive financial results

 

named executive officers

 

our named executive officers or neos for fiscal 2016 are our chief executive officer and chairman of the board guy sella our chief financial officer ronen faier our vice president global sales zvi lando our vp research and development yoav galin and our vp general counsel and corporate secretary rachel prishkolnik

 

compensation objectives and guiding principles

 

the primary objectives of our executive compensation program are as follows

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements of compensation

 

the following table describes each element of our senior executive compensation program and how these elements achieve our compensation objectives

 

 

implementing compensation objectives

 

determining compensation

 

in making compensation decisions we review the performance of the company and each senior executive we also consider the senior executive’s level of responsibility the importance of the senior executive’s role in achieving our corporate objectives and the senior executive’s longterm potential while taking into account his or her current target compensation value of outstanding equity awards and stock ownership levels and our stock selling restrictions for senior executives finally we weigh competitive practices relevant business and organizational changes retention needs and internal pay equity

 

in order to attract retain and motivate the best management talent we believe that we must provide a target compensation package that is competitive relative to our peers in connection therewith the compensation committee considers practices of specific companies that we identified as our peers for executive compensation in 2016 the “2016 peer group” as well as sizeappropriate technology industry survey data

 

each year the compensation committee reviews the market data with the assistance of its external compensation consultant and makes changes as appropriate in order to ensure it continues to appropriately reflect the company’s size industry and scope of operations

 

for fiscal 2016 working with frederic w cook  co inc “fw cook” the compensation committee approved the below 2016 peer group based on multiple factors including business similarities and broadly comparable financial profiles  ie  revenue market capitalization enterprise value and growth profiles the 2016 peer group used for establishing 2016 senior executive target compensation was as follows generac holdings inc verint systems inc mks instruments inc stratasys ltd powell industries inc polypore international inc advanced energy industries inc ormat technologies ltd mellanox technologies ltd xura ltd formerly comverse inc enphase energy inc tessera technologies inc solarcity corporation vicor corporation and wixcom ltd

 

when the compensation committee evaluated the 2016 peer group our revenues were positioned at approximately the thirtyfifth percentile compared to the group our operating income was at approximately the fiftythird percentile and our market capitalization was at approximately the fortyfirst percentile

 

after reviewing the peer group data described above we determined the approximate range within which to target total direct compensation the sum of base salary target annual incentive and the grant date fair value of longterm incentives for our senior executives for 2016 within that range we incorporated flexibility to respond to and adjust for the evolving business environment and our specific hiring and retention needs

 

in general for 2016 we set base salary and short and longterm incentive compensation opportunities for our senior executives including the neos at or near the median of the peer group proxy and survey data where applicable as described below individual levels varied from the targeted position for each of the elements of target total direct compensation based on the compensation committee’s overall subjective evaluation of individual performance senior executive responsibilities relative to benchmark position responsibilities and individual skill set and experience

 

role of compensation committee and management

 

the compensation committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the design and implementation of our senior executive compensation programs the compensation committee with input from the other independent directors evaluates the performance of the ceo the compensation committee then recommends ceo compensation to the independent directors for approval the ceo and the compensation committee together review the performance of our other senior executives and the compensation committee determines their compensation based on recommendations from the ceo the executives do not play a role in their own individual compensation determinations

 

role of compensation consultants

 

with respect to decisions for 2016 target compensation of the neos competitive review of senior executive and nonemployee director compensation programs and peer group review for 2016 the compensation committee retained fw cook to review market trends and advise the compensation committee fw cook is the sole compensation consultant of the compensation committee 

our compensation committee has concluded that no conflicts of interest exist with respect to fw cook’s provision of services after considering the following six factors i the provision of other services to us by fw cook ii the amount of fees fw cook received from us as a percentage of the total revenue of fw cook iii the policies and procedures of fw cook that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest iv any business or personal relationship of the fw cook consultants with a member of the compensation committee v any of our stock owned by the fw cook consultants and vi any business or personal relationship of the fw cook consultants or fw cook with any of our executive officers

 

the compensation committee is directly responsible for the appointment compensation and oversight of fw cook fw cook reported directly to the compensation committee although the compensation committee instructed fw cook to work with management to compile information and to gain an understanding of the company and any companyrelated issues for consideration by the compensation committee including market trends

 

compensationrelated governance policies

 

stock ownership and holding guidelines

 

effective march 31 2015 all of our employees including the neos are subject to our insider trading policy which forbids employees to trade in the company’s stock or any derivatives thereof while holding nonpublic material information or during the company’s set “blackout periods”

 

compensation of the named executive officers

 

in determining target total compensation for our neos for 2016 we evaluated the financial and operational performance of the company and considered each senior executive’s contributions to that performance as part of the annual senior executive compensation review the compensation committee reviewed independent market data as well as thencurrent pay levels of the company’s senior executives the company’s pay philosophy and corporate performance and the individual performance of the company’s senior executives

 

for a discussion of the company’s 2016 performance see “ executive summary — 2016 results and key events ” above

 

 

base salary

 

the compensation committee and the independent directors in the case of the ceo approved fiscal 2016 base salaries for the neos in august 2015 the salaries reflected significant increases in base salaries for all of our neos which were made to i align the cashequity mix of compensation to that of a publicly–traded profitable company following the company’s recent ipo and ii to fall within the range of the median relative to the benchmarking market data consistent with the compensation committee’s stated philosophy as noted above the following table sets forth the 2016 base salaries for the neos

 

 

annual cash incentive compensation

 

for calendar year 2015 each neo was eligible to receive an annual incentive compensation payment based on achievement of pre‑established performance goals for mr sella the performance goals were 100 weighted based upon company‑related financial operational and strategic objectives comprised of 70 financial achievement 10 operations 10 strategy and 10 scalability for the remaining neos the performance goals were weighted based upon 50 company‑related financial operational and strategic objectives the same as for the ceo and 50 individual performance the company exceeded the financial goals by exceeding revenues profitability and gross margin targets specifically the financial achievement parameters of the bonuses were contingent upon the company meeting its targeted annual calendar revenues of 345 million a net income of 20 million and achieving a gross margin of above 25 the company exceeded all of these parameters by achieving revenues of 4247 million a net income of 538 million and a gross margin of 292 the individual performance goals relate to each neo’s specific areas of contribution to the company such as specific goals for the development of products for our vice president of research and development or the penetration of sales in certain new geographic regions for our vice president of sales each of the neos received a bonus under the compensation plan that had been preapproved by the committee and after review by the committee of the specific performance goals and determination of their level of achievement specifically mr sella was awarded 714528 which represents 140 of his base salary mr faier was awarded 260841 which represents 87 of his base salary mr lando was awarded 247065 which represents 82 of his base salary mr galin was awarded 235933 which represents 86 of his base salary and ms prishkolnik was awarded 202542 which represents 81 of her base salary these performancebased cash bonuses were paid in march 2016 for achievement of business objectives established by the committee for calendar year 2015

 

equity compensation

 

in august 2015 the committee evaluated the equity compensation of the ceo and other senior executives as part of the study performed by fw cook in order to align neo compensation with the median of the 2016 peer group with adjustments as necessary based on the committee’s overall subjective evaluation of individual performance senior executive responsibilities relative to benchmark position responsibilities and individual skill set and experience the committee approved annual longterm incentive grants for the ceo and other neos as well as the other senior executives consisting of 50 rsus 40 options and 10 performancebased rsus all of the equity grants have a fouryear vesting period the options were granted at an exercise price of 2509 which was the fair market value of the shares as of the date of the grant the rationale of granting options to senior executives is to create more leverage and greater wealth creation opportunity that can materially impact financial and stock price performance consistent with typical market practice and aligning senior executives with the interests of the company’s shareholders the options have strong performance orientation since they only provide value if the stock price increases the timevested rsus which are granted to all of the company’s employees offer more certainty in value delivery while still being shareholder aligned thereby driving executive retention the committee also allocated 10 of the equity grants to the ceo and other neos in the form of performance based rsus which were linked to the same company and individual performance goals used in the annual incentive program for calendar 2015 entitlement to the performance based rsus was evaluated based on the achievement of the same calendar 2015 bonus criterion vest over a four year period from the date of grant

 

employment agreements

    during fiscal 2016 we were party to employment agreements with messrs sella faier lando galin and ms prishkolnik each of these employment agreements provides for employment of the neo on an “at‑will” basis and provide for a base salary vacation sick leave payments to a pension and severance fund as well as an israeli recreational fund and recuperation pay in accordance with israeli law see the section below titled “ executive compensation table narrative  employment agreements” for more information

 

other compensation 

our ceo and the remaining neos receive benefits that we generally make available to all salaried employees in israel where the neos are located these include contributions to an education fund and to a fund known as manager’s insurance which provides a combination of retirement plan insurance and severance pay benefits to israeli employees see the section below titled “ executive compensation table narrative  employment agreements” for more information executives do not receive any special perquisites not extended to other employees of the company

 

tax deductibility of compensation

 

in general section 162m of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended imposes a limit of 1 million on the amount that a publicly held corporation may deduct for federal income tax purposes for compensation paid to the company’s “covered employees” generally its chief executive officer and three other executive officers other than its chief financial officer whose compensation is disclosed this limitation does not apply to compensation that meets the requirements under section 162m for “qualifying performancebased” compensation  ie  compensation paid only if performance meets preestablished objective goals established by a compensation committee that is comprised solely of two or more “outside directors” based on criteria approved by stockholders with respect to the deductibility limit of section 162m of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended we generally try to preserve the federal income tax deductibility of compensation paid when it is appropriate and is in our best interests however we reserve the right to authorize the payment of nondeductible compensation if we deem that it is appropriate to do so under the circumstances

compensation risk

 

our compensation programs are designed to balance risk and reward in relation to the company’s overall business strategy management assessed and the compensation committee reviewed our senior executive and broadbased compensation and benefits programs based on this assessment we have concluded that our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us among the program attributes that discourage inappropriate risktaking are

employment agreements

 

we are party to an employment agreement with mr sella pursuant to which he began serving as our and solaredge technologies ltd’s chief executive officer and chairman of the board effective september 1 2007 in addition solaredge technologies ltd is party to an employment agreement with i mr faier effective as of january 2 2011 pursuant to which he began serving as its chief financial officer ii mr lando effective as of may 17 2009 pursuant to which he began serving as its global vice president of sales iii mr galin effective as of june 1 2006 pursuant to which he began serving as its vice president research and development and iv mrs prishkolnik effective november 1 2010 pursuant to which she began serving as vp general counsel and corporate secretary

 

each of these employment agreements provides for employment of the neo on an “at‑will” basis in all cases either party may terminate the agreement by providing 60 days prior written notice provided however that we may terminate the agreements immediately and without prior notice and make a payment in lieu of advance notice in accordance with applicable law in addition we may also terminate the agreements immediately upon written notice in the event of “cause” as defined therein

 

 

the agreements provide for a base salary vacation sick leave payments to a pension and severance fund as well as an israeli recreational fund and recuperation pay in accordance with israeli law pursuant to the agreements we have effected a manager’s insurance policy for each neo pursuant to which we make contributions on behalf of each neo as well as the required statutory deductions from salary and any other amounts payable under the agreements on behalf of each neo to the relevant authorities in accordance with the requirements of israeli law for all neos we contribute 833 of each neos base salary toward the policy for the severance pay component 5 for the savings and risk component or 6 in the case of a pension fund with such amount to be allocated to a provident fund or pension plan 75 for the educational fund component up to 4100 per year and up to 25 for disability insurance in all cases we deduct 5 of each neo’s base salary to be paid on behalf of the neo toward the policy or 55 in the event an neo chooses to allocate his payments to a pension plan and 25 for the educational fund component

 

on february 5 2016 amendment no 12 of the supervision of financial services provident funds law 57652005 and the corresponding integrated extension order for compulsory pension came into effect pursuant to which as of july 1 2016 employee and employer contribution rates for pension and manager’s insurance funds shall increase for all of our employees including our neos as of july 1 2016 employee pension fund contributions shall increase to 575 and employer pension fund contributions shall increase to 625 in the event that an employee has a manager’s insurance fund the employer shall be required to allocate a portion of its contributions to purchase disability insurance to insure 75 of an employee’s salary which allocation shall not decrease the severance component of the employer’s contributions below 5 or increase total employer contributions above 75

2016 option exercises and stock vested table

 

the following table provides information regarding option exercises and stock vested during the last fiscal year for each named executive officer 

 

 

 

1 the value realized on exercise is calculated as the difference between a either i the actual sales price of the shares underlying the options exercised if the shares were immediately sold upon exercise or ii the closing price of the shares underlying options exercised if the shares were not immediately sold after exercise and b the applicable exercise price of the options

 

2 the value realized on vesting is calculated by multiplying a the closing price of a common share on the vesting date and b the number of shares acquired on vesting before withholding taxes

 

potential payments upon termination of employment and change of control

 

severance

 

pursuant to the terms of the employment agreements with the neos as well as in accordance with israeli law upon a termination of the neo’s employment the neo is entitled to the payments we have made on behalf of each neo to the manager’s insurance policy

 

 

equity acceleration

 

pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement if within 12 months following the occurrence of a “change in control” mr sella is terminated without “cause or if mr sella terminates his employment due to “justifiable reasons” each such term as defined in his mr sella’s agreement he will be entitled to full acceleration of any unvested shares of restricted stock or stock options held by him at the time of such termination pursuant to the terms of their respective employment agreements if mr faier or mr lando employment agreements are terminated within 12 months of the date of a “transaction” without “cause” each term as defined therein then all outstanding and unvested stock options will become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of such termination in addition pursuant to mr faier’s employment agreement if within 12 months following a “transaction” mr faier terminates his employment due to “justifiable reason” as defined therein then all outstanding and unvested stock options will become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of such termination mr galin and mrs prishkolnik’s respective employment agreements do not contain similar vesting acceleration provisions

 

furthermore in the event of a “transaction” as defined in our 2007 global incentive plan the “2007 plan” all outstanding equity held by each neo will accelerate to the extent such awards are not assumed or substituted by a successor corporation in connection with such transaction

 

potential payments as of june 30 2016

introduction 

 

we have invented an intelligent inverter solution that has changed the way power is harvested and managed in a solar pv system our direct current “dc” optimized inverter system maximizes power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system and providing comprehensive and advanced safety features our system consists of our power optimizers inverters and cloudbased monitoring platform and addresses a broad range of solar market segments from residential solar installations to commercial and small utility scale solar installations since we began commercial shipments in 2010 we have shipped approximately 17 gigawatts “gw” of our dc optimized inverter systems and our products have been installed in solar pv systems in 74 countries 

 

historically the solar pv industry used traditional string and central inverter architectures to harvest pv solar power however traditional inverter architectures result in energy losses as well as systemic challenges in design flexibility safety and monitoring more recently microinverter technology was introduced in an attempt to resolve these challenges but this technology has certain inherent limitations we believe that our dc optimized inverter system consisting of an inverter and distributed power optimizers best addresses all of these challenges 

 

our system allows for superior power harvesting and module management relative to traditional inverter systems by deploying power optimizers at each pv module while maintaining a competitive system cost by keeping the ac inversion and grid interaction centralized using a simplified dcac inverter the entire system is monitored through our cloudbased monitoring platform that enables reduced system operation and maintenance “om” costs our system enables each pv module to operate at its own maximum power point “mpp” rather than a systemwide average enabling dynamic response to realworld conditions such as atmospheric conditions pv module aging soiling and shading and offering improved energy yield relative to traditional inverter systems in addition to higher efficiency our system’s installed cost per watt is competitive with traditional inverter systems of leading manufacturers and generally lower than comparable microinverter systems of leading manufacturers furthermore our architecture allows for complex rooftop system designs and enhanced safety and reliability our technology and system architecture are protected by 52 awarded patents and 105 patent applications filed worldwide as of june 30 2015 

 

we primarily sell our products directly to large solar installers and engineering procurement and construction firms “epcs” and indirectly to thousands of smaller solar installers through large distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers our customers include leading providers of solar pv systems to residential and commercial end users such as solarcity vivint solar inc and sunrun inc we sell to key solar distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers as well as to several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules 

 

we were founded in 2006 and began commercial shipments in 2010 as of june 30 2015 we have shipped approximately 67 million power optimizers and 289000 inverters more than 100000 installations many of which may include multiple inverters are currently connected to and monitored through our cloudbased monitoring platform 

 

limitations of existing technologies 

 

a solar pv system consists of pv modules which produce direct current “dc” power when exposed to sunlight an inverter which transforms the dc power into alternating current “ac” power that is required by the electricity grid and associated cabling fuse boxes and mounting hardware traditionally solar pv systems connected strings of solar pv modules to one or more inverters for this energy conversion 

 

traditional inverter architecture still constitutes the vast majority of the pv inverter market especially for larger commercial and utility installations however traditional inverter architecture suffers from significant inefficiencies leading to suboptimal power generation these challenges include 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

in addition to power losses the traditional inverter architecture also has system design installation and operational challenges including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

the solaredge solution 

 

our dc optimized inverter system maximizes power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system and providing comprehensive and advanced safety features our solution consists of our power optimizers inverters and cloudbased monitoring platform and addresses a broad range of solar market segments from residential solar installations to commercial and small utilityscale solar installations 

 

the key advantages of our solution include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

our products 

 

our solution consists of a dc power optimizer an inverter and a cloudbased monitoring platform that operate as a single integrated system 

 

solaredge power optimizer our dc power optimizer is a highly reliable and efficient dctodc converter which is connected by installers to each pv module or embedded by pv module manufacturers into their modules as part of the manufacturing process our power optimizer increases energy output from the pv module to which it is connected by continuously tracking the mpp of each module and controlling its working point the power optimizer’s ability to track the mpp of each pv module and its ability to increase or decrease its output voltage enables the inverter’s input voltage to remain fixed under a large variety of string configurations this feature enhances flexibility in pv system designs enabling use of different string lengths in a single pv system connected to the same inverter use of pv panels situated on multiple orientations connected to the same inverter and using varied pv module types in the same string in addition our power optimizers monitor the performance of each pv module and communicates this data to our inverter using our proprietary power line communication in turn the inverter transmits this information to our monitoring server each power optimizer is equipped with our proprietary safety mechanism which automatically reduces the output voltage of each power optimizer to 1v unless the power optimizer receives a failsafe signal from a functioning inverter as a result if the inverter is shut down eg for system maintenance due to malfunction in the event of a fire or otherwise the dc voltage throughout the system is reduced to a safe level 

 

our power optimizers are designed to withstand high temperatures and harsh environmental conditions and contain multiple bypass features that localize failures and enable continued system operation in the vast majority of cases of power optimizer failure our power optimizers are compatible with the vast majority of modules on the market today and carry a 25year product warranty our power optimizers are designed to be used with our inverters as well as third party inverters to provide power optimization monitoring and safety features can also be achieved with third party inverters by adding supplemental communications hardware during fiscal 2013 2014 and 2015 revenues derived from the sale of power optimizers represented 485 488 and 488 of total revenues respectively 

 

solaredge inverter our dctoac inverters contain sophisticated digital control technology with efficient power conversion architecture resulting in superior solar power harvesting and high reliability and are designed to work exclusively with our dc power optimizers a proprietary power line communication receiver is integrated into each inverter receiving data from our power optimizers storing this data and transmitting it to our monitoring server when an internet connection exists since each string which is equipped with our power optimizers provides fixed input voltage to our inverter the inverter is able to operate at its highest efficiency at all times and therefore is more costefficient energy efficient and reliable like our power optimizers our inverters are designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions since the power rating of an inverter determines how many pv modules it can serve larger installations require inverters with higher power ratings we currently offer our second generation of inverters which come in two models a onephase inverter designed to address the residential market 22 kilowatts “kw” to 114 kw and a threephase inverter designed to address the residential market in certain european countries and the commercial market 4 kw to 333 kw in june 2015 we introduced an extended commercial solution that consists of various inverters sized 25kw 276kw and 333kw for the europe middle east africa and asia pacific markets and 144kw and 333kw for the north american market these inverters which are identical in size and enclosure as other solaredge inverters are designed for commercial installations reduce the number of required inverters and increase the system return on investment each of our inverters are sold with a 12year warranty that is extendable to 20 or 25 years for an additional cost during fiscal 2013 2014 and 2015 revenues derived from the sale of inverters represented 448 466 and 483  of total revenues respectively 

  

  

solaredge monitoring software our cloudbased monitoring software collects power voltage current and system data sent from our inverters and power optimizers and allows users to view the data at the module level string level inverter level and system level from any browser or from most smart phones and tablets the monitoring software continuously analyzes data and flags potential problems the monitoring software includes features which are used on a routine basis by integrators installers maintenance staff and system owners to improve a solar pv system’s performance by maximizing solar power harvesting and reducing om costs by increasing system uptime and detecting pv module performance issues more effectively connection to the monitoring server is completed during installation by the installer the installer then receives full access to system data through the monitoring software and can select the amount of data to be shared with the system owner 

 

product roadmap 

 

our products reflect the innovation focus and capabilities of our technology departments our product roadmap is divided into four categories power optimizers inverters monitoring services and energy storage 

 

power optimizers we currently sell our third generation power optimizer which was designed for fully automated assembly and which is based on our third generation asic a key element of our reliability strategy and a significant differentiator relative to our competitors is our use of proprietary asics to control among other things our power optimizer’s power conversion safety features and pv module monitoring instead of using large numbers of discrete components our power optimizer uses a single proprietary asic thus reducing the total number of components in an electrical circuit and thereby improving reliability we are in the final stages of testing our fourth generation asic and we expect to begin commercial shipments of our fourth generation power optimizers in the first half of 2016 in addition we are also in the final stage of developing all the necessary subsystems for the fifth generation asic which will be used in our fifth generation power optimizer each new asic generation has reduced the number of components required and meaningfully improved the efficiency of the power optimizer the efficiency improvement reduces the energy losses which in turn reduces the amount of heat dissipation this enables design of a more cost effective and usually smaller enclosure and also keeps the electronics cooler thereby improving the power optimizer’s reliability 

 

inverters our inverter roadmap is intended to serve three purposes i expand addressable market by developing new and larger inverters designed specifically for larger commercial installations and utilityscale projects ii improve the electronics to increase the total power throughput without changing the existing enclosure thereby reducing the actual cost per watt and increasing economies of scale and iii improve ease of installation by integrating additional functionality required in certain installations in order to reduce costs of additional hardware and labor costs we are currently developing a third generation high frequency inverter that is intended to bring significant efficiency improvements and thereby to reduce heat dissipation enclosure size and cost as well as size and cost of passive components such as the main inductor and capacitors 

 

monitoring services our cloudbased monitoring server is continuously growing by the amount of data aggregated we are continuously developing tools to accommodate our growth and further enhance our service offering specifically we plan to increase data compression in order to enable support for a rapidly increasing number of field systems while using lowcost equipment in addition we plan to improve our reporting systems and enable users to obtain selfgenerated customized reports we also expect to expand algorithms that detect and pinpoint problems that can affect power production in field systems we further plan to add more capabilities through our public application program interface to allow users to build and integrate our system into their own systems and to allow users to build and share useful applications based on monitoring data gathered by our software 

 

  

  

energy storage the ability to efficiently store and manage electric energy is expected to further accelerate the growth of the global solar market we believe that by optimizing each battery we can improve the depth of charge and discharge as well as flexibility and longevity of battery bank life we are in the initial development stages of technology based on our current system architecture and patents that includes a dcbased solution for optimizing battery storage systems we believe that this solution combined with energy efficiency functionality will present a significant growth opportunity in addition we have developed solutions to allow our inverters to support third party batteries for energy storage such as the tesla powerwall these inverters are expected to be available in the fourth calendar quarter of 2015 and are designed to provide smart energy functions such as maximizing selfconsumption programming use of energy in desired hours of the day and home energy backup solutions  

 

sales and marketing strategy 

 

since commencing sales activities in early 2010 our strategy has been to focus on markets where electricity prices irradiance and government policies make solar pv installations economically viable today our products have been installed in 74 countries including the us australia belgium canada china france germany israel italy japan the netherlands singapore and the united kingdom 

 

we target our sales and marketing efforts to the largest distributors electrical equipment wholesalers epc contractors and installers in each of the countries where we operate in the us germany italy the united kingdom and australia our products are carried and actively sold by most of the top solar pv distributors as well as the largest electrical distribution companies that are active in solar pv we anticipate that an increasing percentage of solar pv equipment sales will also occur through electrical equipment wholesalers who sell to a broad range of electrical contractors and we are focused on cultivating these global relationships as of june 30 2015 approximately 9745 installers around the world have installed solaredge solar pv systems including an average of 300 new installers per month since the beginning of 2015 we also sell our power optimizers to several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules 

 

additionally we have a number of programs focused on educating installers and other industry professionals about our technology and we use a combination of road shows webinars and partner trainings to show them how best to design sell and implement our technology in their projects 

 

our sales strategy and the entrepreneurial culture of our company have allowed us to react quickly to trends in the countries in which we sell our products for example in response to the abrupt cut in feedin tariffs in europe in 2012 we shifted our focus to the us and ended fiscal 2015 with 733 of our revenues from the us as compared to 76 in fiscal 2012 

 

our customers 

 

our largest customer in fiscal 2015 was solarcity the largest independent solar power provider in the us solarcity accounted for 191  of our revenues in fiscal 2014 and 246 of our revenues in fiscal 2015 we also derive a significant portion of our revenues from key solar distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers in the us and worldwide however none of these customers represented more than 10 of our revenues in fiscal 2015 

 

training and customer support 

 

we offer our installer base a comprehensive package of customer support and training services which include presales support ongoing trainings and technical support before during and after installation we also provide customized support programs to pv module manufacturers large installers and distributors to help prioritize and track support issues thereby enabling short cycle times for issue resolution in 2015 we conducted approximately 290 training events in 15 countries with an aggregate of approximately 4200 attendees 

 

we offer a wide variety of training including handson and ondemand video sessions and online product and training materials we support our commercial system customers with design consulting throughout their sales process and installation our technical support organization includes local expert teams call centers in california germany and israel and an online service portal our tollfree call centers are open monday through friday from 900 am to 800 pm in every region in which we sell our products in addition customers can open and track support cases 247 utilizing our online portal all support cases are monitored via a customer relationship management system in order to ensure service track closure of all customer issues and further improve our customer service our call centers have access to our cloudbased monitoring platform database which enables realtime remote diagnostics 

 

  

  

customer service and satisfaction has been a key component of our business and we expect it to continue to be integral to our success in the future we maintain high levels of customer engagement through our call centers in california germany and israel in addition to our call centers we have field service engineers located in the geographies where we are active and support our customers with commissioning of large projects introduction of new technologies and features and onthejob training of new installers as of june 30 2015 our customer support and training organization consisted of 61 employees worldwide 

 

our technology 

 

we have drawn on our expertise in the fields of power electronics magnetic design mechanical and heat dissipation capabilities control loops and algorithms and power line communications to design and develop what we believe to be the most advanced commercial solutions for harvesting power from solar pv systems our advanced technologies are explained in more detail below 

 

power optimizers 

 

our power optimizers are dcdc step upstep down buckboost converters designed and developed to operate in harsh outdoor environments at very high conversion efficiency our power optimizers include proprietary power electronics customized to efficiently convert power from the pv module to the inverter the conversion topology and components are all designed for the power optimizer specifications and verified for consistent performance and reliability in numerous lab tests and simulations we also design and utilize custom magnetic cores and windings to maximize the density of the power optimizer while maintaining optimal thermal performance 

 

a key factor in the performance of our power optimizer is determined by the digital control algorithms and closedloop mechanism the power optimizer’s control is built into our advanced asic which is responsible for all critical digital control functions of the power optimizer including detailed power analysis digital control of the power conversion subsystem and power line communications and networking since each power optimizer handles the power and voltage of a single module we are able to reach a high degree of semiconductor integration by leveraging low cost silicon in standard semiconductor packages as a result much of the functionality of our power optimizer can be integrated into a standard complementary metaloxide semiconductor asic instead of discrete electrical components resulting in lower costs and higher reliability 

 

the asic performs the critical power analysis and power conversion control functions of the power optimizer the power analysis function processes the status and working parameters at the power optimizer’s input and output and together with advanced digital control and state machine logic controls the power conversion function in addition our digital control system uses an innovative predictive control technology that allows the solar pv installation to anticipate and adapt to changing operating conditions and protect against system anomalies 

 

each power optimizer in the array is connected to the inverter by a power line communications networking link our power line communications link uses a proprietary networking technology that we developed utilizing the existing dc wiring between the power optimizers and the inverter to transmit and receive data between these devices 

 

inverters 

 

our inverter is designed for singlestage dcac conversion the control loop maintains a fixed dc voltage level at its input thereby allowing for longer uneven and multifaceted strings while also enabling custom cost efficient and reliable inverter design and component selection all of the power components as well as the main magnetic components for our inverters can then be optimized for dcac inversion at high efficiency 

 

the digital control algorithms of our inverters are implemented using programmable digital signal processors which allow for flexibility and adaptation of control loops for various grids and for the requirements and standards of various grid operators across geographies we have already implemented the control mechanisms necessary to support advanced grid codes and standards that are required to support high penetration of solar energy into the grid 

 

  

  

manufacturing 

 

we have designed our manufacturing processes to produce high quality products at competitive costs the strategy is threefold outsource automate and localize we have entered into outsourcing contracts with two of the world’s leading global electronics manufacturing service providers jabil circuit inc and flextronics industrial ltd by using these contract manufacturers rather than building our own manufacturing infrastructure we are able to access advanced manufacturing equipment processes skills and capacity on a “capital light” budget our contract manufacturers are responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products except with regard to end of line testing equipment we expect to continue this funding arrangement in the future with respect to any expansions to such existing lines further contracting with global providers such as jabil and flextronics gives us added flexibility to manufacture certain products in china closer to target markets in asia and the north american west coast and other products in hungary closer to target markets in europe and the north american east coast potentially increasing responsiveness to customers while reducing costs and delivery times 

 

we have completed the development of our first proprietary automated assembly line for use at the hungary flextronics manufacturing plant and it is expected to be operative in the third calendar quarter of 2015 we expect the automated assembly line to enable us to scale production of our power optimizers decrease labor costs and improve quality levels once production is operating at full capacity we expect the automated assembly line to be capable of producing approximately 18 million power optimizers per year this automated assembly line can also be replicated and deployed to additional production facilities we have designed and are responsible for funding all of the capital expenses associated with this automated assembly line we are investing resources in additional automated assembly lines and we will own and be responsible for funding all of the capital expenses related thereto the current and expected capital expenses associated with these automated assembly lines are not significant and will be funded out of our cash flows 

 

reliability and quality control 

 

our power optimizers are either connected to each pv module by installers or embedded in each pv module by pv module manufacturers our power optimizers are designed to be as reliable as the pv module itself and capable of withstanding the same operating and environmental conditions 

 

our reliability methodology includes a multilevel plan with design analysis by inhouse and external experts subsystem testing of critical components by accelerated life testing and integrative testing of design prototypes by highly accelerated life testing and large sample groups as part of our reliability efforts we subject components to industry standard conditions and tests including in accelerated life chambers that simulate burnin thermal cycling dampheat and other stresses we also test complete products in stress tests and in the field our rigorous testing processes have helped us to develop highly reliable products 

 

in order to verify the quality of each of our products when it leaves the manufacturing plant each component subassembly and final product are tested multiple times during production these tests include automatic optical inspection incircuit testing board and componentlevel functional testing safety testing and integrative stress testing we employ a serial numberdriven manufacturing process auditing and traceability system that allows us to control production line activities verify correct manufacturing processes and to achieve itemspecific traceability 

 

as a part of our quality and reliability approach failed products from the field are returned and subjected to root cause analysis the results of which are used to improve our product and manufacturing processes and further reduce our field failure rate 

 

certifications 

 

our products and systems comply with the applicable regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are sold as well as all other major markets around the world collectively covering approximately 80 of the global solar pv market as measured by mw capacity shipped these include safety regulations electromagnetic compatibility standards and grid compliance 

 

research and development 

 

we devote substantial resources to research and development with the objective of developing new products and systems adding new features to existing products and systems and reducing unit costs of our products and systems our development strategy is to identify features products and systems for both software and hardware that reduce the cost and improve the effectiveness of our solutions for our customers we measure the effectiveness of our research and development by metrics including product unit cost efficiency reliability power output and ease of use 

 

  

  

we have a strong research and development team with wideranging experience in power electronics semiconductors power line communications and networking and software engineering in addition many members of our team have expertise in solar technologies as of june 30 2015 our research and development organization had a headcount of 188 people our research and development expense net totaled 158 million 183 million and 220 million for fiscal 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively 

 

intellectual property 

 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies information processes and knowhow we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws in the us and similar laws in other countries confidentiality agreements and procedures and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology as of june 30 2015 we had 38 issued us patents 14 issued nonus patents 48 patent applications pending for examination in the us and 57 patent applications pending for examination in other countries all of which are related to us applications a majority of our patents relate to dc power optimization and dc to ac conversion for alternative energy power systems power system monitoring and control and management systems our issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2027 and 2033 we continually assess opportunities to seek patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages 

 

we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we believe that many elements of our manufacturing processes involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes test equipment designs algorithms and procedures 

 

all of our research and development personnel are required to enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us 

 

our customers and business partners are required to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans 

 

competition 

 

the markets for our products are competitive and we compete with manufacturers of traditional inverters and manufacturers of other mlpe including microinverters and power optimizers the principal areas in which we compete with other companies include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

our dc optimized inverter system competes principally with products from traditional inverter manufacturers such as sma solar technology ag abb ltd and kaco new energy gmbh in the north american residential market we compete with traditional inverter manufacturers as well as microinverter manufacturers such as enphase energy inc many traditional inverter manufactures such as sma solar technology ag and abb ltd have recently introduced microinverter products in addition several new entrants to the mlpe market including lowcost asian manufacturers have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped similar products we believe that our dc optimized inverter system offers significant technology and cost advantages that reflect a competitive differentiation over traditional inverter systems and microinverter technologies 

 

government incentives 

 

us federal state and local government bodies as well as nonus government bodies provide incentives to owners end users distributors and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar pv systems from property tax assessments the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of these government subsidies and economic incentives which vary by geographic market and from time to time the following is a summary of the major current government subsidies and economic incentives in the key jurisdictions where our customers operate 

 

united states 

 

the us federal government provides an uncapped investment tax credit that allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30 of qualified expenditures for a residential or commercial solar pv system placed in service on or before december 31 2016 this credit is scheduled to reduce to 10 effective january 1 2017 the federal government also permits accelerated depreciation for eligible solar pv systems in addition approximately half of the us states offer an additional personal andor corporate investment or production tax credit for solar further more than half of the us states and many local jurisdictions have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems 

 

most us states have instituted a “net metering” regulatory policy which allows a solar pv system owner to connect an onsite solar pv system to the utility grid and offset purchases of electricity from the utility with energy generated by the solar pv system and exported to the grid many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production including renewable portfolio standards that require utilities to procure a percentage of electricity delivered from renewable energy sources such as solar pv systems to prove compliance with such mandates utilities typically must surrender renewable energy certificates “recs” solar pv system owners often are able to sell recs to utilities directly or in rec markets 

 

many utilities and state governments offer a rebate or other cash incentive for the installation and operation of a solar pv system these include “upfront” rebates that provide cash payments based on the cost size or expected production of a solar pv system as well as performancebased incentives that provide cash payments based on the energy generated over a period 

 

europe 

 

historically european solar power incentives were robust recently however several european governments have scaled back their solar power incentives under austerity measures adopted in response to the eurozone economic crisis in particular subsidies have been reduced or eliminated in countries including germany and italy in june 2012 the german government passed an amendment to its renewable energy law eeg 2012 which reduced the available pv feedin tariff rate revised the volumebased digression schedule limited the amount of electricity that pv generators can export to the grid and added a 52 gigawatt capacity limit after which subsidies under the eeg will cease altogether in september 2012 germany further reduced feedin tariffs for roofbased systems while reducing or eliminating feedin tariffs for groundbased systems in july 2013 the italian government discontinued feedin tariff payments for new solar pv projects in some of european countries solar power incentives have been challenged as unconstitutional or unlawful 

 

  

  

other european countries have continued to offer significant solar energy incentives the netherlands has instituted new incentives in recent years including tax deductions grants toward equipment purchases and a feedin tariff however the feedin tariff is generally not available for residential installations and the aggregate incentive funds are limited france instituted an incentive system in march 2011 providing feedin tariffs and a bidding process for system operators to sell electricity from new solar projects to the stateowned electricity company however the feedin tariff was subsequently reduced 

 

employees 

 

as of june 30 2015 we had 440 fulltime employees of these fulltime employees 188 were engaged in research and development 115 in sales and marketing 106 in operations and support and 31 in general and administrative capacities of our employees 282 were based in israel 73 were based in the us 36 were based in china 28 were based in germany and an additional 21 were based in other countries in europe 

 

none of our employees are represented by a labor union we have not experienced any employment related work stoppages and we consider relations with our employees to be good

risk factors 

tableend 

 

risk factors which coul d cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in particular forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties some of which cannot be predicted or quantified see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

 

risks related to our business and our industry 

 

we have a history of losses and we cannot be certain that we will sustain profitability in the future 

  

we incurred net losses of 282 million and 214 million for fiscal 2013 and 2014 respectively and the first fiscal year where we were profitable was fiscal 2015 achieving a net profit of 211 million we expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business including in connection with marketing and developing our products expanding into new product markets and geographies maintaining and enhancing our research and development operations and hiring additional personnel in addition as a public company we incur significant additional legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company we do not know whether our revenues will grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs and our limited operating history makes it difficult to assess the extent of these expenses or their impact on our results of operations 

  

further revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons many of which are outside our control including a decline in demand for our products increased competition a decrease in the growth of the solar industry or our market share or our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities if we fail to maintain sufficient revenue to support our operations we may not be able to sustain profitability 

  

our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 

  

we have only been in existence since 2006 and our first full fiscal year of commercial shipments was 2011 much of our growth has occurred in recent periods our limited operating history combined with the rapidly evolving and competitive nature of our industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects in addition we have limited insight into emerging trends that may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries including unpredictable and volatile revenues and increased expenses as we continue to grow our business the viability and demand for solar energy solutions and in turn our products may be affected by many factors outside of our control including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we do not manage these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully our business will suffer 

  

  

  

if demand for solar energy solutions does not continue to grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our business will suffer 

  

our solution is utilized in solar pv installations as a result our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years and we cannot be certain that consumers and businesses with respect to distributed solar solutions or utilities with respect to utilityscale solar projects will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to grow our business if demand for solar energy solutions fails to develop sufficiently demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business 

  

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business 

  

federal state local and foreign government bodies provide incentives to owners end users distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments payments of renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar pv systems from property tax assessments the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market because our customers’ sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business these subsidies and incentives may expire on a particular date end when the allocated funding is exhausted or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase or as a result of legal challenges the adoption of new statutes or regulations or the passage of time these reductions or terminations often occur without warning 

  

in addition several jurisdictions have adopted renewable portfolio standards which mandate that a certain portion of electricity delivered by utilities to customers come from a set of eligible renewable energy resources by a certain compliance date some programs further specify that a portion of the renewable energy quota must be from solar electricity under some programs a utility can receive a “credit” for renewable energy produced by a third party by either purchasing the electricity directly from the producer or paying a fee to obtain the right to renewable energy generated but used by the generator or sold to another party a renewable energy credit allows the utility to add this electricity to its renewable portfolio requirement total without actually expending the capital for generating facilities however there can be no assurances that such policies will continue for example in may 2014 ohio froze renewable portfolio requirements at current levels proposals to extend compliance deadlines reduce targets or repeal standards have also been introduced in a number of states reduction or elimination of renewable portfolio standards or successful efforts to meet current standards could harm or halt the growth of the solar pv industry and our business 

  

changes to net metering policies may significantly reduce demand for electricity from solar pv systems and harm our business 

  

our business benefits from favorable net metering policies in several us states canadian provinces and european countries in which our customers operate net metering allows a solar pv system owner to pay his or her local electric utility only for power usage net of production from the solar pv system transforming the conventional relationship between customers and traditional utilities system owners receive credit for the energy that the solar installation generates to offset energy usage at times when the solar installation is not generating energy under a net metering program the customer typically pays for the net energy used or receives a credit against future bills at the retail rate if more energy is produced than consumed in some locations customers are also reimbursed by the electric utility for net excess generation on a periodic basis 

  

most us states have adopted some form of net metering however net metering programs have recently come under regulatory scrutiny in some us states due to challenges alleging that net metering policies inequitably shift costs onto nonsolar ratepayers by allowing solar ratepayers to sell electricity at rates that are too high for utilities to recoup their fixed costs generally the programs have been upheld in their current form though some were subject to minor modification and others have been designated for additional regulatory review in the next few years we cannot assure you that the programs will not be significantly modified following these reviews 

  

  

  

if the value of the credit that customers receive for net metering is significantly reduced endusers may be unable to recognize the same level of cost savings associated with net metering that current endusers enjoy the absence of favorable net metering policies or of net metering entirely or the imposition of new charges that only or disproportionately affect endusers that use net metering would significantly limit demand for solar pv systems that are sold by our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and future growth 

  

existing electric utility industry regulations and changes to regulations may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar pv systems that may significantly reduce demand for our products or harm our ability to compete 

  

federal state local and foreign government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry and internal policies and regulations promulgated by electric utilities heavily influence the market for electricity generation products and services these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and the interconnection of customerowned electricity generation and governments and utilities continuously modify these regulations and policies these regulations and policies could deter purchases of renewable energy products including solar pv systems sold by our customers this could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for our products for example utilities commonly charge fees to larger industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for backup purposes these fees could increase the cost to use solar pv systems sold by our customers and make them less desirable thereby harming our business prospects financial condition and results of operations in addition depending on the region electricity generated by solar pv systems competes most effectively with expensive peakhour electricity from the electric grid rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the utilities’ peak hour pricing policies or rate design such as to a flat rate could require the price of solar pv systems and their component parts to be lower in order to compete with the price of electricity from the electric grid 

  

changes in current laws or regulations applicable to us or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the us europe or other jurisdictions in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations any changes to government or internal utility regulations and policies that favor electric utilities could reduce the competitiveness of solar pv systems sold by our customers and cause a significant reduction in demand for our products and services for example regulators in certain us states have been asked to consider proposals to assess fees on consumers purchasing energy from solar pv systems or imposing a new charge that would disproportionately impact solar pv system owners who utilize net metering either of which would increase the cost of solar pv energy to those consumers and could reduce demand for our products any similar government or utility policies adopted in the future that discourage the growth of solar pv systems could reduce demand for our products and services and adversely impact our growth in addition changes in our products or changes in export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

  

decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid would make the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and would likely lower sales of our products the price of electricity derived from the utility grid could decrease as a result of 

  

 

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

  

  

 

  

 

  

 

moreover technological developments in the solar components industry could allow our competitors and their customers to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be achieved by us and our customers which could result in reduced demand for our products 

  

if the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations incorporating our systems is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

  

an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a solar pv system and could reduce the demand for solar systems and thus demand for our products 

  

many endusers depend on financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build or purchase a solar pv system as a result an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or their customers the endusers to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a solar pv system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our products which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of endusers install solar pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through financing an increase in interest rates could lower such enduser’s return on investment on a solar pv system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar pv systems and in each case could cause such endusers to seek alternative investments 

  

the market for our products is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce power optimizer inverter and solar pv system monitoring products which could negatively affect our results of operations and market share 

  

the market for solar pv solutions is highly competitive we principally compete with traditional inverter manufacturers as well as microinverter manufacturers currently our dc optimized inverter system competes with products from traditional inverter manufacturers and microinverter manufacturers as well as emerging technology companies offering alternative optimizer microinverter or other mlpe products several traditional inverter manufacturers have recently introduced or announced plans to introduce microinverter products in addition several new entrants to the mlpe market including lowcost asian manufacturers have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped products in markets in which we sell our products we expect competition to intensify as new and existing competitors enter the mlpe market 

  

several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger have greater financial marketing distribution customer support and other resources are longer established and have better brand recognition further certain competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than us may partner with other competitors to provide combined technologies and competing solutions and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours in addition some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices for our products in order to compete effectively if we have to reduce our prices by more than we anticipated or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer 

  

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may have a material adverse effect on demand for our offerings 

  

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advances in other forms of distributed solar pv power generation storage solutions such as batteries the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could result in product obsolescence the loss of competitiveness of our products decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors 

  

  

  

our industry has historically been cyclical and experienced periodic downturns 

  

our future success partly depends on continued demand for solar pv systems in the endmarkets we serve including the residential and commercial sectors in the united states and europe the solar industry has historically been cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns which may affect the demand for equipment that we manufacture the solar industry has undergone challenging business conditions in recent years including downward pricing pressure for pv modules mainly as a result of overproduction and reductions in applicable governmental subsidies contributing to demand decreases although the solar industry is experiencing a slow recovery there is no assurance that the solar industry will not suffer significant downturns in the future which will adversely affect demand for our solar products and our results of operations 

  

defects or performance problems in our products could result in loss of customers reputational damage and decreased revenue and we may face warranty indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products 

  

although our products meet our stringent quality requirements they may contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new generations are released errors defects or poor performance can arise due to design flaws defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties which can affect both the quality and the yield of the product any actual or perceived errors defects or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products shipment delays rejection of our products damage to our reputation lost revenue diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and increases in customer service and support costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

furthermore defective components may give rise to warranty indemnity or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive from the affected products we offer a minimum 12year limited warranty for our inverters and a 25year limited warranty for our power optimizers our limited warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship of our products under normal use and service conditions as a result we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold products and recognized revenue while we do have accrued reserves for warranty claims our estimated warranty costs for previously sold products may change to the extent future products are not compatible with earlier generation products under warranty our warranty accruals are based on our assumptions and we do not have a long history of making such assumptions as a result these assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our systems causing us to incur substantial unanticipated expense to repair or replace defective products in the future or to compensate customers for defective products our failure to accurately predict future claims could result in unexpected volatility in and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

  

if one of our products were to cause injury to someone or cause property damage including as a result of product malfunctions defects or improper installation then we could be exposed to product liability claims we could incur significant costs and liabilities if we are sued and if damages are awarded against us further any product liability claim we face could be expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention the successful assertion of a product liability claim against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages penalties or fines subject us to adverse publicity damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely affect sales of our products in addition product liability claims injuries defects or other problems experienced by other companies in the residential solar industry could lead to unfavorable market conditions for the industry as a whole and may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract new customers thus harming our growth and financial performance 

  

if we do not forecast demand for our products accurately we may experience product shortages delays in product shipment excess product inventory or difficulties in planning expenses which will adversely affect our business and financial condition 

  

our products are manufactured according to our estimates of customer demand which requires us to make multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to demand from solar pv installers and distributors their end customers and general market conditions because we sell a large portion of our products to larger solar installers and various distributors who in turn sell to local installers who in turn sell to their end customers the system owner we have limited visibility as to end customer demand and it is difficult to forecast future enduser demand to plan our operations if we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are cancelled or shipments are delayed we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell conversely if we underestimate demand we may not have sufficient inventory to meet end customer demand or to ramp up production at our contract manufacturers in a timely manner or we could incur additional costs lose market share damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forego potential revenue opportunities for example in fiscal 2014 unexpectedly high customer demand forced us to shorten transportation time from our factories in china and hungary by using air freight rather than less expensive ocean freight 

  

  

  

we are dependent on ocean transportation to deliver our products in a cost efficient manner if we are unable to use ocean transportation to deliver our products our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 

  

we rely on commercial ocean transportation for the delivery of a large percentage of our products to our customers in north america we also rely on more expensive air transportation when ocean transportation is not available or compatible with the delivery time requirements of our customers our ability to deliver our products via ocean transportation could be adversely impacted by shortages in available cargo capacity changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling pricing payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel taxes and labor and other factors such as labor strikes and work stoppages not within our control if we are unable to use ocean transportation and are required to substitute more expensive air transportation our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted in the first calendar quarter of 2015 contentious negotiations between the pacific maritime association and the international longshore  warehouse union resulted in port slowdowns caused port congestion and major delays in the transfer of cargo in the united states west coast accordingly in the quarter ended march 31 2015 we shipped a higher percentage of our products to our customers in north america via air transportation material interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation such as the aforementioned dispute whether caused by strike work stoppage lockout slowdown or otherwise could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers 

  

we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and currently rely upon two contract manufacturers to build all of our products our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs 

  

the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues as a result fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner in addition the facilities in which our products are manufactured are located outside of the us currently in china and hungary the location of these facilities outside of key markets such as the us increases shipping time thereby causing a long lead time between manufacturing and delivery 

  

if any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers an alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms including price any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers or increase our shipping costs to make up for delays in manufacturing which in turn could reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers and damage our reputation with local installers and potential endusers and cause us to forego potential revenue opportunities 

  

we may experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations 

  

our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise such processes involve a number of precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched identified and properly addressed and rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques andor expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased warranty reserve increased production and logistics costs and delays any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

  

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for key components and raw materials in our products to adequately meet anticipated demand due to the limited number of such suppliers any cessation of operations or production or any shortage delay price change imposition of tariffs or duties or other limitation on our ability to obtain the components and raw materials we use could result in sales delays cancellations and loss of market share 

  

we depend on limited or single source suppliers for certain key components and raw materials used to manufacture our products making us susceptible to quality issues shortages and price changes any of these limited or single source suppliers could stop producing our components or supplying our raw materials cease operations or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with one or more of our competitors as a result these suppliers could stop selling to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all because there are a limited number of suppliers of solar pv system components and raw materials used to manufacture our products it may be difficult to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative components or raw materials on commercially reasonable terms and our ability to satisfy customer demand may be adversely affected transitioning to a new supplier or redesigning a product to accommodate a new component manufacturer would result in additional costs and delays these outcomes could harm our business or financial performance 

  

any interruption in the supply of limited source components or raw materials for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers could result in lost revenue or higher expenses and would harm our business 

  

failure by our contract manufacturers or our component or raw material suppliers to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations may adversely affect our business 

  

we do not control our contract manufacturers or suppliers or their business practices accordingly we cannot guarantee that they follow ethical business practices such as fair wage practices and compliance with environmental safety and other local laws a lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative manufacturers or suppliers which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products product shortages or other disruptions of our operations violation of labor or other laws by our manufacturers or suppliers or the divergence of a supplier’s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the us or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and harm our business 

  

our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter which could make our future performance difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations for a particular period to fall below expectations resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock 

  

our quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the future we have experienced seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in the past as a result of seasonal fluctuations in our customers’ business for example our customers’ and endusers’ ability to install solar energy systems is affected by weather as for example during the winter months in europe and the northeastern us such installation delays can impact the timing of orders for our products further given that we are an earlystage company operating in a rapidly growing industry the true extent of these fluctuations may have been masked by our recent growth rates and consequently may not be readily apparent from our historical results of operations and may be difficult to predict our financial performance sales working capital requirements and cash flow may fluctuate and our past quarterly results of operations may not be good indicators of future performance any substantial decrease in revenues would have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price 

  

we rely on distributors and large installers to assist in selling our products and the failure of these customers to perform as expected could reduce our future revenue 

  

we currently sell a substantial percentage of our products through distributors who in turn sell to local installers and through direct sales to large installers we do not have exclusive arrangements with these third party distributors and large installers many of our distributors also market and sell products from our competitors and all of our large installer customers also use products from our competitors these distributors and large installers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and with little or no notice further these distributors and large installers may fail to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors termination of agreements with current distributors or large installers failure by these distributors or large installers to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new distributor or large installer relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and results of operations 

if we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer 

  

our future success and ability to implement our business strategy depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team and key technical personnel each of whom would be difficult to replace all of our employees including our senior management are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time competition for highly skilled individuals with technical expertise is extremely intense and we face challenges identifying hiring and retaining qualified personnel in many areas of our business integrating new employees into our team could prove disruptive to our operations require substantial resources and management attention and ultimately prove unsuccessful an inability to retain our senior management and other key personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel could limit or delay our strategic efforts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

  

  

  

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management’s attention 

  

as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” the listing requirements of the nasdaq global select market and other applicable securities rules and regulations compliance with these rules and regulations requires significant legal and financial compliance and demands on our systems and resources and makes some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly than if we were a private company as certain additional securities rules and regulations become applicable to us our legal and financial compliance costs may increase the exchange act requires among other things that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to maintain and if required improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard significant resources and management oversight are required as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could harm our business and results of operations we may need to hire more employees in the future which would increase our costs and expenses 

  

if we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 

  

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and unfair competition laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we have applied for patents in the us europe and china some of which have been issued we cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology and any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to among other things rebrand or redesign our affected products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the us we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated infringed or otherwise violated 

  

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert management’s attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate 

  

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry from time to time we may also be subject to claims of intellectual property right infringement and related litigation and if we gain greater recognition in the market we face a higher risk of being the subject of claims that we have violated others’ intellectual property rights regardless of their merit responding to such claims can be time consuming can divert management’s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses in litigation or settlement while we believe that our products and technology do not infringe in any material respect upon any valid intellectual property rights of third parties we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims if we do not successfully defend or settle an intellectual property claim we could be liable for significant monetary damages and could be prohibited from continuing to use certain technology business methods content or brands to avoid a prohibition we could seek a license from the applicable third party which could require us to pay significant royalties increasing our operating expenses if a license is not available at all or not available on reasonable terms we may be required to develop or license a nonviolating alternative either of which could require significant effort and expense if we cannot license or develop a nonviolating alternative we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our offerings and may be unable to effectively compete any of these results would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

  

we may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees which could result in litigation and adversely affect our business 

  

we enter into agreements with our employees pursuant to which they agree that any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement are assigned to us or owned exclusively by us depending on the jurisdiction without the employee retaining any rights a significant portion of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees in the course of their employment for us under the israeli patent law 57271967 the “patent law” inventions conceived by an employee during the scope of his or her employment with a company are regarded as “service inventions” which belong to the employer absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer giving the employee service invention rights the patent law also provides that if there is no such agreement between an employer and an employee the israeli compensation and royalties committee the “committee” a body constituted under the patent law shall determine whether the employee is entitled to remuneration for his or her inventions recent decisions by the committee and the israeli supreme court have created uncertainty in this area as the israeli supreme court held that employees may be entitled to remuneration for their service inventions despite having specifically waived any such rights further the committee has not yet determined the method for calculating this committeeenforced remuneration although our employees have agreed that any rights related to their inventions are owned exclusively by us we may face claims demanding remuneration in consideration for such acknowledgement as a consequence of such claims we could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to our current andor former employees or be forced to litigate such claims which could negatively affect our business 

  

the loss of or events affecting one of our major customers could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

for fiscal 2015 solarcity one of the largest independent solar power providers in the us accounted for 246 of our revenues our next five largest customers for fiscal 2015 together accounted for 299  of our revenues our customers’ decisions to purchase our products are influenced by a number of factors outside of our control including retail energy prices and government regulation and incentives among others in addition these customers may decide to no longer use our products and services for other reasons which may be out of our control although we have agreements with some of our largest customers these agreements do not have longterm purchase commitments and are generally terminable by either party after a relatively short notice period the loss of or events affecting one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our planned expansion into new markets could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks 

  

in fiscal 2015 we sold our products to approximately 210 direct customers in 39 countries including the us australia belgium canada china france germany israel italy japan the netherlands and the united kingdom we intend to introduce new products targeted at large commercial and utilityscale installations and to expand into other international markets our success in these new product and geographic markets will depend on a number of factors including our ability to develop solutions to address the requirements of the large commercial and utilityscale solar pv markets timely qualification and certification of new products for large commercial and utilityscale solar pv installations acceptance of power optimizers in solar pv markets in which they have not traditionally been used and our ability to manage increased manufacturing capacity and production 

  

further these solar pv markets have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products and our success will depend on our ability to adapt properly to these differences these differences may include differing regulatory requirements including tax laws trade laws labor regulations tariffs export quotas customs duties or other trade restrictions limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection international political or economic conditions restrictions on the repatriation of earnings longer sales cycles warranty expectations product return policies and cost performance and compatibility requirements in addition expanding into new geographic markets will increase our exposure to presently existing risks such as fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and difficulties and increased expenses in complying with us and foreign laws regulations and trade standards including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the “fcpa” 

  

failure to develop and introduce these new products successfully or to otherwise manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to sustain profitability 

  

  

  

if we fail to manage our recent and future growth effectively we may be unable to execute our business plan maintain high levels of customer service or adequately address competitive challenges 

  

we have experienced significant growth in recent periods with our annual product sales growing rapidly from approximately 8400 inverters and approximately 181000 power optimizers in fiscal 2011 our first full fiscal year of commercial shipments to annual product sales exceeding 152000 inverters and 36 million power optimizers in fiscal 2015 we intend to continue to expand our business significantly within existing and new markets this growth has placed and any future growth may place a significant strain on our management operational and financial infrastructure in particular we will be required to expand train and manage our growing employee base and scale and otherwise improve our it infrastructure in tandem with that headcount growth our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers as well as manage multiple geographic locations 

  

our current and planned operations personnel it and other systems and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth and may require us to make additional unanticipated investment in our infrastructure our success and ability to further scale our business will depend in part on our ability to manage these changes in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot manage our growth we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures this could also result in declines in quality or customer satisfaction increased costs difficulties in introducing new offerings or other operational difficulties any failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our business and reputation 

  

covenants in our credit facility may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities and competitive developments and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions 

  

we have a revolving line of credit from silicon valley bank “svb” the svb credit facility restricts our ability to take certain actions such as borrow money grant liens pay dividends dispose of assets or engage in certain transactions our credit agreement with svb also requires us to maintain certain ebitda and liquidity levels these restrictions may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities competitive developments and adverse economic or industry conditions in addition our obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets including all of our intellectual property which limits our ability to provide collateral for additional financing nevertheless we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future and any debt instrument we enter into in the future may contain similar restrictions or collateral packages a breach of any of these covenants or a failure to pay principal or interest when due could result in a variety of adverse consequences including the acceleration of our indebtedness our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings if some or all of our indebtedness is accelerated acceleration could result in the foreclosure by the lenders on our assets that secure the credit facility 

  

furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into new debt instruments on acceptable terms if we are unable to satisfy financial covenants and other terms under existing or new credit arrangements or obtain waivers or forbearance from our lenders or if we are unable to obtain refinancing or new financings for our working capital equipment and other needs on acceptable terms if and when needed our business would be adversely affected 

  

we may not be able to raise additional capital to execute our current or future business strategies on favorable terms if at all or without dilution to our stockholders 

  

we expect that we may need to raise additional capital to execute our current or future business strategies however we do not know what forms of financing if any will be available to us some financing activities in which we may engage could cause your equity interest in the company to be diluted which could cause the value of your stock to decrease if financing is not available on acceptable terms if and when needed our ability to fund our operations expand our research and development and sales and marketing functions develop and enhance our products respond to unanticipated events including unanticipated opportunities or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited in any such event our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed and we may be unable to continue our operations 

  

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

  

although our financial results are reported in us dollars us dollar revenues accounted for 782  of our revenues in fiscal 2015 in addition a significant portion of our operating expenses are accrued in new israeli shekels primarily related to payroll and to a lesser extent the euro and other currencies our profitability is affected by movements of the us dollar against the euro and to a lesser extent the new israeli shekel and other currencies in which we generate revenues incur expenses and maintain cash balances foreign currency fluctuations may also affect the prices of our products our prices are denominated primarily in us dollars if there is a significant devaluation of a particular currency the prices of our products will increase relative to the local currency and may be less competitive despite our efforts to minimize foreign currency risks primarily by entering into forward hedging transactions to sell euro for us dollars at a predefined rate and maintaining cash balances in new israeli shekels significant longterm fluctuations in relative currency values in particular a significant change in the relative values of the euro and to a lesser extent the new israeli shekel and other currencies against the us dollar could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition 

  

  

  

any unauthorized access to or disclosure or theft of personal information we gather store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation 

  

we receive store and use certain personal information of our customers and the endusers of our customers’ solar pv systems including names addresses email addresses credit information and energy production statistics we also store and use personal information of our employees we take steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the personal information we collect store and transmit but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we and our suppliers or vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures 

  

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee or contractor error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information were to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws 

  

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws however we currently operate in and intend to further expand into many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our entry into certain jurisdictions requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from us standards it is possible that our employees subcontractors agents and partners may take actions in violation of our policies and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us to criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

  

risks related to operations in israel 

  

conditions in israel affect our operations and may limit our ability to develop produce and sell our products 

  

although we are incorporated in delaware our headquarters and research and development center are located in israel accordingly political economic and military conditions in israel directly affect us israel has been involved in a number of armed conflicts and has been the target of terrorist activity rocket fire from the gaza strip including against civilian targets has occurred on an irregular basis disrupting daytoday civilian activity and negatively affecting business conditions any future armed conflict political instability or violence in the region may impede our ability to manage our business effectively or to engage in research and development or may otherwise adversely affect our business or operations in the event of war we and our israeli products subcontractors and suppliers may cease operations which may cause delays in the distribution and sale of our products some of our directors executive officers and employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and are subject to being called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances in the event that our principal executive office is damaged as a result of hostile action or hostilities otherwise disrupt the ongoing operation of our offices our ability to operate could be materially adversely affected 

  

additionally several countries principally in the middle east restrict doing business with israeli companies and additional countries and groups may impose similar restrictions if hostilities in israel or political instability in the region continue or increase if recent regime changes and civil wars in neighboring states result in the establishment of fundamentalist islamic regimes or governments more hostile to israel or if egypt or jordan abrogates its respective peace treaty with israel israel could be subject to additional political economic and military confines and our operations and ability to sell our products to countries in the region could be materially adversely affected these restrictions may limit materially our ability to obtain manufactured components and raw materials or to sell our products 

  

  

  

any hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners or significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the tax benefits that are available to us under israeli law require us to meet various conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future which could increase our costs and taxes 

  

our israeli subsidiary is eligible for certain tax benefits provided to “benefited enterprises” under the israeli law for the encouragement of capital investments 1959 the “investment law” in order to remain eligible for the tax benefits for “benefited enterprises” we must continue to meet certain conditions stipulated in the investment law and its regulations as amended if these tax benefits are reduced cancelled or discontinued our israeli taxable income would be subject to regular israeli corporate tax rates and we may be required to refund any tax benefits that we have already received plus interest and penalties thereon the standard corporate tax rate for israeli companies was increased to 25 in 2012 and 2013 and further increased to 265 for 2014 and thereafter additionally if we increase our activities outside of israel through acquisitions for example our expanded activities might not be eligible for inclusion in future israeli tax benefit programs the israeli government may furthermore independently determine to reduce phase out or eliminate entirely the benefit programs under the investment law regardless of whether we then qualify for benefits under those programs at the time which would also adversely affect our global tax rate and our results of operations 

  

the terms of israeli government grants that we have received restrict our ability to transfer technologies outside of israel and we may be required to pay penalties in such a case or upon the sale of our company 

  

in fiscal 2015 we received a total of 04 million from the office of the chief scientist in the israel ministry of economy “ocs” we do not expect to receive additional grants from the ocs in fiscal 2016 the terms of the previous grants require us to pay royalties at a rate of 4 to 45 on sales of products developed under these grants up to the total grant amount linked to the us dollar and bearing interest at an annual rate of libor applicable to dollar deposits even after payment in full we will still be required to comply with the requirements of the israeli encouragement of industrial research and development law 1984 the “rd law” and related regulations with respect to those past grants when a company develops knowhow technology or products under an ocs grant the grant terms and the rd law restrict the transfer outside of israel of such knowhow without the prior approval of the ocs consequently if aspects of our technologies are deemed to have been developed with ocs funding the discretionary approval of an ocs committee would be required for any transfer to third parties outside of israel of knowhow related to those aspects of our technologies the ocs may impose conditions on any arrangement under which it permits us to transfer technology or development out of israel or may not grant such approval at all 

  

any transfer of ocssupported technology or knowhow outside of israel may require payment of significant amounts to the ocs depending on the value of the transferred technology or knowhow the amount of ocs support the time of completion of the ocssupported research project and other factors these restrictions and requirements for payment may impair our ability to sell our technology assets outside of israel furthermore the consideration available to our shareholders in a transaction involving the transfer outside of israel of technology or knowhow developed with ocs funding such as a merger or similar transaction would be reduced by any amounts that we are required to pay to the ocs 

  

it may be difficult to enforce a judgment of a us court against our officers and directors to assert us securities laws claims in israel or to serve process on our officers and directors 

  

the majority of our directors and executive officers reside outside of the us and most of our assets and most of the assets of these persons are located outside of the us consequently a judgment obtained against any of these persons including a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws may not be collectible in the us it also may be difficult for you to effect service of process on these persons in the us or to assert us securities law claims in original actions instituted in israel israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of us securities laws on the grounds that israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim in addition even if an israeli court hears a claim it may determine that israeli law and not us law is applicable to the claim if us law is found to be applicable the content of applicable us law must be proven as a fact by expert witnesses which can be a time consuming and costly process further an israeli court may not enforce a judgment awarded by a us or other nonisraeli court certain matters of procedure will also be governed by israeli law there is little binding case law in israel that addresses these matters as a result of the difficulty associated with enforcing a judgment against any of these persons in israel you may not be able to obtain or enforce a judgment against many of our directors and executive officers 

  

  

  

risks related to the ownership of our common stock 

  

we cannot assure you that our stock price will not decline or not be subject to significant volatility 

  

the trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in march 2015 at a price of 1800 per share the reported high and low prices of our common stock has ranged from 1949 to 4300 per share through june 30 2015 the price of our stock may change in response to fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods and also may change in response to other factors including factors specific to companies in our industry many of which are beyond our control as a result our share price may experience significant volatility and may not necessarily reflect the value of our expected performance among other factors that could affect our stock price are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies in addition the stock prices of many renewable energy companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial cost and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

  

  

  

  

the price of our common stock could decline if securities analysts or other third parties publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or if one or more of our analysts ceases to cover us or to regularly publish reports about us 

  

the trading of our common stock is likely to be influenced by the reports and research that industry or securities analysts publish about us our business our market or our competitors if one or more securities or industry analysts downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price would likely decline if one or more securities or industry analysts ceases to cover the company or fails to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

  

as an emerging growth company within the meaning of the securities act we may utilize certain modified disclosure requirements and we cannot be certain if these reduced requirements will make our common stock less attractive to investors 

  

we are an emerging growth company and for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to “emerging growth companies” including not being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute compensation not previously approved we have utilized and we plan in future filings with the sec to continue to utilize the modified disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies as a result our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important 

  

in addition section 107 of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can utilize the extended transition period provided in section 7a2b of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards thus an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and therefore we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” 

  

we could remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of i the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least 1 billion as indexed for inflation ii the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock in our initial public offering iii the date on which we have during the previous threeyear period issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt or iv the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined under the exchange act 

our stock price could decline due to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for future sale 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline these sales could also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equityrelated securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 

upon expiration of the underwriters’ lockup from our initial public offering which currently scheduled to be released on september 22 2015 approximately 307 million shares of our outstanding common stock and approximately 36 million shares of common stock underlying vested stock options will become eligible for sale subject in some cases to volume and other restrictions of rules 144 and 701 under the securities act as well as our insider trading policy holders of up to approximately 299 million of these shares of our common stock or 761 of our total outstanding common stock based on shares outstanding on august 19 2015 will be entitled to rights with respect to registration of these shares under the securities act pursuant to an investors’ rights agreement if these holders of our common stock by exercising their registration rights sell a large number of shares they could adversely affect the market price for our common stock if we file a registration statement for the purposes of selling additional shares to raise capital and are required to include shares held by these holders pursuant to the exercise of their registration rights our ability to raise capital may be impaired sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market following the expiration of the lockup or otherwise or the perception that these sales could occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

  

  

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by discouraging delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may believe advantageous these provisions include 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” which generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder becomes an “interested” stockholder 

  

our certificate of incorporation includes a forum selection clause which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us 

  

our certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder including any beneficial owner to bring i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or employees to us or to our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or iv any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine will be a state court located within the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware in all cases subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions this forum selection provision may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us it is also possible that notwithstanding the forum selection clause that is included in our certificate of incorporation a court outside of delaware could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable 

  

  

  

we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

  

we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors subject to applicable laws and provisions of our debt instruments and organizational documents after taking into account our financial condition results of operations capital requirements general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant as a result capital appreciation in the price of our common stock if any may be your only source of gain on an investment in our common stock 

  

if we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls we may not be able to report our financial results accurately which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and timeconsuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and requires attestations of the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors we would be required to perform the annual review and evaluation of our internal controls no later than for fiscal 2016 we qualify as an emerging growth company and thus we are exempt from the auditors’ attestation requirement until such time as we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company regardless of whether we qualify as an emerging growth company we will still need to implement substantial control systems and procedures in order to satisfy the reporting requirements under the exchange act and applicable nasdaq global select market requirements among other items establishing these internal controls will be costly and may divert management’s attention 

  

evaluation by us of our internal controls over financial reporting may identify material weaknesses that may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences including sanctions by the sec or violations of nasdaq global select market rules there also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and could also lead to a decline in the price of our common stock

tableend 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the sections of this annual report on form 10k captioned “selected consolidated financial data and other data” and “business” and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form 10k in addition to historical financial information the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors including those discussed under the sections of this annual report captioned “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” 

 

overview 

 

we are a leading provider of intelligent inverter solutions that are changing the way power is harvested and managed in solar pv systems our dc optimized inverter solution maximizes power generation at the individual pv module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar pv system our systems allow for superior power harvesting and module management by deploying power optimizers at each pv module while maintaining a competitive system cost by using a simplified dcac inverter our systems are monitored through our cloudbased monitoring platform that enables lower system operating and maintenance “om” costs we believe that these benefits along with our comprehensive and advanced safety features are highly valued by our customers 

 

we are a leader in the global module level power electronics “mlpe” market according to gtm research and as of june 30 2015 we have shipped approximately 67 million power optimizers and 289000 inverters approximately100000 installations many of which may include multiple inverters are currently connected to and monitored through our cloudbased monitoring platform as of june 30 2015 we have shipped approximately 17 gw of our dc optimized inverter systems our products are sold in approximately 39 countries and are installed in solar pv systems in 74 countries 

 

we primarily sell our products directly to large solar installers and engineering procurement and construction firms “epcs” and indirectly to thousands of smaller solar installers through large distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers our sales strategy focuses on toptier customers in markets where electricity prices irradiance amount of sunlight and government policies make solar pv installations economically viable we also sell our power optimizers to several pv module manufacturers that offer pv modules with our power optimizer physically embedded into their modules 

 

in fiscal 2015 we sold our products to approximately 210 direct customers in 39 countries and as of june 30 2015 approximately 9782indirect customers had registered with us through our cloudbased monitoring platform with the exception of solarcity which accounted for 246 of our revenues in fiscal 2015 no customer accounted for more than ten percent of our fiscal 2015 revenues as a result of the rapid growth of us solar pv installations the us has become the largest market for our products accounting for 733 of our revenues in fiscal 2015 

 

we were founded in 2006 with the goal of addressing the lost power generation potential that is inherent in the use of traditional solar pv inverter technology thereby increasing the return on investment in solar pv systems the following is a chronology of some of our key milestones 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have achieved substantial growth since we commenced commercial shipments in fiscal 2010 our revenues were 790 million 1332 million and 3251 million for fiscal 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively gross margins were 56 165 and 252 for fiscal 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively net losses were 282 million and 214 million for fiscal 2013 and 2014 respectively and net profit was 211 million for fiscal 2015 

 

we continue to focus on our longterm growth we believe that our market opportunity is large and that the transition from traditional inverter architecture to dc optimized inverter architecture as the architecture of choice for distributed solar installations globally will continue we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this market trend we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to acquire new customers in our existing markets grow internationally and drive additional revenue we also plan to expand our product offerings to further penetrate the large commercial and utility segments we expect to continue to invest in research and development to enhance our product offerings and develop new cost effective solutions 

 

we believe that our strategy results in a lean operating base with low expenses that will enable profitability on lower revenues relative to our competitors we believe that our sales and marketing research and development and general and administrative costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the longterm as we continue to grow due to economies of scale with this increased operating leverage we expect our gross and operating margins to increase in the longterm 

 

performance measures 

 

in managing our business and assessing financial performance we supplement the information provided by the financial statements with other operating metrics these operating metrics are utilized by our management to evaluate our business measure our performance identify trends affecting our business and formulate projections we use metrics relating to yearly shipments inverters shipped power optimizers shipped and megawatts shipped to evaluate our sales performance and to track market acceptance of our products from year to year we use metrics relating to monitoring systems monitored and megawatts monitored to evaluate market acceptance of our products and usage of our solution 

 

we provide the “megawatts shipped” metric which is calculated based on nameplate capacity shipped to show adoption of our system on a nameplate capacity basis nameplate capacity shipped is the maximum rated power output capacity of an inverter and corresponds to our financial results in that higher total capacities shipped are generally associated with higher total revenues however revenues increase with each additional unit not necessarily each additional mw of capacity sold accordingly we also provide the “inverters shipped” and “power optimizers shipped” operating metrics 

 

we calculate systems monitored through our cloudbased monitoring platform which tracks installations of products shipped by us if and to the extent that such installations are connected to the monitoring platform our shipping metrics correspond to our monitoring metrics in that higher numbers of units or nameplate capacity shipped are generally associated with higher numbers of systems and megawatts monitored however there is a delay between the date in which units are shipped installed and ultimately connected to the cloudbased monitoring platform further some system owners opt not to connect their systems to the cloudbased monitoring platform which causes their systems not to be included in “systems monitored” or “megawatts monitored” because installations contain multiple power optimizers and some installations contain multiple inverters the number of installations monitored differs from the number of inverters and power optimizers shipped 

 

  

  

key components of our results of operations 

 

the following discussion describes certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations 

 

revenues 

 

we generate revenues from the sale of dc optimized inverter systems for solar pv installations which include power optimizers inverters and our cloudbased monitoring software our customer base includes large solar installers distributors wholesalers epcs and pv module manufacturers 

 

our revenues are affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our dc optimized inverter systems the volume and average selling price of our systems is driven by the supply and demand for our products changes in the product mix between our residential and commercial products the customer mix between large and small customers the geographical mix of our sales sales incentives enduser government incentives seasonality and competitive product offerings 

 

our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to expand our market share in each of the geographies in which we compete expand our global footprint to new evolving markets grow our production capabilities to meet demand and to continue to develop and introduce new and innovative products that address the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers 

 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

 

cost of revenues consists primarily of product costs including purchases from our contract manufacturers and other suppliers as well as costs related to shipping customer support product warranty personnel depreciation of test and manufacturing equipment hosting services for our cloudbased monitoring server and other logistics services our product costs are affected by technological innovations such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions economies of scale resulting in lower component costs and improvements in production processes and automation some of these costs primarily personnel and depreciation of test and manufacturing equipment are not directly affected by sales volume 

 

we outsource our manufacturing to thirdparty manufacturers and negotiate product pricing on a quarterly basis our thirdparty manufacturers are responsible for funding the capital expenses incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products except with regard to end of line testing equipment which resulted in capital expenditures of 10 million and 28 million for fiscal 2014 and 2015 respectively we expect to continue this funding arrangement in the future with respect to any expansions to such existing lines we also procure strategic and critical components from various approved vendors on behalf of our contract manufacturers at times higher than anticipated demand has exceeded the production capacities of these manufacturers these production shortfalls as well as shortages in the supply of certain raw materials required us to use air freight rather than less expensive ocean freight to deliver the majority of our products the expansion of current manufacturing sites by our contract manufacturers allowed us to reduce these expenses in fiscal 2015 as well as to build sufficient inventory to continue our growth without the need to ship products by air we believe that continued expansion of the current manufacturing sites by our contract manufacturers together with a planned north american contract manufacturing site will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our forecasted demands with minimal shipment of products by air freight 

 

in addition we completed development of our first proprietary automated assembly line for our power optimizers for use at the hungary flextronics manufacturing plant and it is expected to be operative in the third calendar quarter of 2015 we have designed and are responsible for funding all of the capital expenses associated with this and future automated assembly lines we expect to invest in additional automated assembly lines in the future and we will own and be responsible for funding all of the capital expenses incurred in conjunction with such automated assembly lines the current and expected capital expenses associated with these automated assembly lines are not significant and will be funded out of our cash flows 

 

key components of our logistics supply channel consist of third party distribution centers in the us and europe finished goods are either shipped to our customers directly from our contract manufacturers or shipped to third party distribution centers and then finally shipped to our customers 

 

gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices product costs product mix customer mix geographical mix shipping method warranty costs and seasonality 

 

  

  

operating expenses 

 

operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnelrelated costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories and include salaries benefits payroll taxes commissions and stockbased compensation our fulltime employee headcount in our research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative departments has grown from 179 as of june 30 2013 to 239 as of june 30 2014 to 334 as of june 30 2015 we expect to continue to hire significant numbers of new employees to support our growth the timing of these additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses in any particular period both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue we expect to continue to invest substantial resources to support our growth and anticipate that each of the following categories of operating expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts for the foreseeable future 

 

research and development expenses net 

 

research and development expenses net include personnelrelated expenses such as salaries benefits stockbased compensation and payroll taxes our research and development employees are engaged in the design and development of power electronics semiconductors software and power line communications and networking our research and development expenses also include thirdparty design and consulting costs materials for testing and evaluation asic development and licensing costs depreciation expense and other indirect costs we devote substantial resources to ongoing research and development programs that focus on enhancements to and cost efficiencies in our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation thereby maintaining our competitive position 

 

research and development expenses are presented net of the amount of any grants we receive for research and development in the period in which we receive the grant we previously received grants and other funding from the binational industrial research and development foundation and the ocs certain of those grants require us to pay royalties on sales of certain of our products which are recorded as cost of revenues we may receive additional funding from these entities or other funding requiring payment of similar royalties in the future 

 

sales and marketing expenses 

 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnelrelated expenses such as salaries sales commissions benefits payroll taxes and stockbased compensation these expenses also include travel fees of independent consultants trade shows marketing costs associated with the operation of our sales offices and other indirect costs the expected increase in sales and marketing expenses is due to an expected increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel and the expansion of our global sales and marketing footprint enabling us to increase our penetration of new markets while most of our sales in fiscal 2012 were in europe sales in the us have grown steadily since fiscal 2012 generating a significant majority of our revenues in 2015 revenues generated in the us represented 485 and 733 of our revenues in fiscal 2014 and 2015 respectively sales in europe which represented most of our sales until fiscal 2013 also increased in absolute numbers in fiscal 2014 and 2015 and represented 404 and 201 of our revenues in fiscal 2014 and 2015 respectively we currently have a sales presence in the us australia canada china france germany israel italy japan the netherlands turkey and the uk we intend to continue to expand our sales presence to additional countries 

  

general and administrative expenses 

 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries employee benefits payroll taxes and stockbased compensation related to our executives finance human resources information technology and legal organizations travel expenses facilities costs fees for professional services and registration fees related to becoming a publicly traded company professional services consist of audit legal remuneration to board members tax insurance information technology and other costs 

 

nonoperating expenses 

 

financial expenses net 

 

financial expenses net consist primarily of interest expense gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations and hedging transactions and gains or losses related to remeasurement of warrants granted in relation to longterm debt incurred by the company in december 2012 

 

  

  

interest expense consists of interest and other charges paid to svb in connection with our revolving line of credit and interest on our term loan from kreos which was fully repaid on january 26 2015 

 

gains or losses related to remeasurement of warrants granted in relation to longterm debt incurred by the company in december 2012 are not expected to occur in the future as the warrants were fully exercised on june 18 2015 

 

our functional currency is the us dollar with respect to our subsidiaries other than our israeli subsidiary the functional currency is the applicable local currency financial expenses net is net of financial income which consists primarily of the effect of foreign exchange differences between the us dollar and the new israeli shekel the euro and other currencies related to our monetary assets and liabilities and the realization of gain from hedging transactions 

 

taxes on income 

 

we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we operate 

 

from incorporation through the end of fiscal 2014 we experienced operating losses and consequently accumulated a significant amount of operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions by the end of fiscal 2015 we fully utilized our unused operating loss carryforwards with respect to us federal tax obligations in fiscal 2015 we recorded an income tax expense of 17 million for federal and state taxes in the us 

 

solaredge technologies ltd our israeli subsidiary is taxed under israeli law income not eligible for benefits under the investment law is taxed at the corporate tax rate the corporate tax rates in israel were 25 in fiscal 2013 a recent amendment of the israeli income tax ordinance increased the corporate tax rate to 265 commencing on january 1 2014 however the effective tax rate payable by a company that derives income from a “benefited enterprise” or a “preferred enterprise” as defined under the investment law may be considerably less capital gains derived by an israeli company are subject to tax at the prevailing corporate tax rate 

 

our subsidiaries are subject to taxes in each of the countries in which they operate all of our products are developed and manufactured by our subsidiary solaredge technologies ltd which sells our products to its customers as well as to other entities in the solaredge group which then sell them to their customers all intercompany sales of products and services are paid for or reimbursed pursuant to transfer price policies established for each of the countries in which we operate consistent with arm’s length profit levels 

 

due to our history of losses from inception through the end of fiscal 2014 we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in fiscal 2015 the first fiscal year in which we were profitable we used our carryforward losses from previous years in israel and california

comparison of fiscal year 2014 and 2015 

 

revenues 

 

 

 

revenues increased by 1919 million or 1440 in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in the number of systems sold worldwide with the us being the largest market the number of power optimizers sold increased by approximately 22 million units or 1695 from approximately 13 million units in fiscal 2014 to approximately 35 million units in fiscal 2015 the number of inverters sold increased by approximately 91000 units or 1488 from approximately 61000 units in fiscal 2014 to approximately 152000 units in fiscal 2015 the increase in the number of units sold was mainly attributable to an increase in the number of systems sold in the us market and certain countries in europe in general our increase in revenues in fiscal 2015 was attributable to rapid expansion in the us market our blended average selling price per watt for units shipped decreased by 0017 or 45 in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to a change in our customer mix which included larger portion of sales to large customers to whom we provide volume discounts 

 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

 

 

  

cost of revenues increased by 1320 million or 1187 in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in the number of units sold an increase in personnel related costs as a result of an increase in our operations and support headcount and an increase in spending on air shipments gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from 165 fiscal 2014 to 252 in fiscal 2015 product costs generally decreased at a rate consistent with our blended selling price in addition costs associated with air shipments decreased as a percentage of revenues as did costs associated with our warranty expenses warranty provisions personnel related costs and other costs associated with our support and operations departments 

 

  

  

operating expenses 

 

research and development net 

 

 

 

research and development net increased by 38 million or 206 in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of 23 million as a result of an increased headcount of engineers the increase in headcount reflects our continuing investment in enhancements of existing products as well as development associated with bringing new products to market in addition expenses related to materials consumption for development consultants and subcontractors and other directly related overhead costs increased by 09 million 06 million and 05 million respectively in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 these amounts were partially offset by 05 million received pursuant to a grant from the ocs during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 

 

  sales and marketing 

 

 

 

sales and marketing expenses increased by 72 million or 404 in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of 54 million as a result of an increase in headcount supporting our growth in the us and europe in addition expenses associated with our worldwide sales offices travel and other directly related overhead costs and costs related to trade shows and marketing activities and the use of third party vendors increased by 08 million 07 million and 03 million respectively in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 

 

general and administrative 

 

 

 

general and administrative expenses increased by 22 million or 522 in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of 15 million as a result of an increase in headcount as part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the legal finance human resources recruiting and information technology functions required of a growing company and increased expenses related to bonuses and equitybased compensation  in addition costs related to accounting tax legal and information systems consulting and costs related to being a public company increased by 04 million and 03 million respectively in the fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 

 

  

  

financial expenses income 

 

 

 

financial expenses increased by 23 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to increased expenses of 54 million related to the remeasurement of certain warrants which were fully exercised on june 18 2015 and 03 million related to an early prepayment fee related to long term debt these amounts were partially offset by gains associated with hedging transactions of the us dollar against the euro and new israeli shekel in the amount of 17 million in fiscal 2015 compared to a loss of 02 million in fiscal 2014 a decrease of 11 million in interest expenses due to the full repayment of our borrowings under our revolving line of credit and other long term debt as well as a decrease of 04 million in expenses from foreign exchange fluctuations and bank charges 

 

other expenses 

 

 

 

other expenses of 104000 recorded in fiscal 2015 are related to the disposal of furniture and other equipment related to the move to our new offices in israel 

 

taxes on income 

 

 

 

taxes on income increased by 17 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to tax payments and tax accruals with respect to us federal taxes and taxes in certain us states in which we operate 

 

net income loss

comparison of fiscal 2013 and 2014 

 

revenues 

 

 

 

revenues increased by 542 million or 686 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the number of systems sold the number of power optimizers sold increased by approximately 05 million units or 63 from approximately 08 million units in fiscal 2013 to approximately 13 million units in fiscal 2014 the number of inverters sold increased by approximately 29000 units or 90 from approximately 32000 units in fiscal 2013 to approximately 61000 units in fiscal 2014 the increases in units sold were attributable to accelerated sales growth in the us market partially offset by a sales decline in certain european markets the relatively higher increase in inverters sold compared to power optimizers sold is attributed to the fact that sales in the us were mainly to the residential segment which utilizes singlephase inverters while sales in europe were primarily of three phase inverters for both the residential and commercial segment which are associated with a higher ratio of power optimizers per inverter the overall increase in unit sales was driven by deeper penetration of our existing customer base the addition of new customers and broader acceptance of our products resulting from among other factors increased investment in sales and marketing during fiscal 2014 we continued to experience a slight decline in the average selling price of our products our blended average selling price per watt decreased by 0001 or 028 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to changes in our customer mix as larger customers which receive volume discounts accounted for a larger portion of our sales this was partially offset as mentioned above by a higher percentage of sales attributable to residential systems sales which have a higher average selling price per watt than commercial systems we expect the average selling price per watt to continue to decrease as the percentage of our total revenues attributable to large customers and commercial systems increases 

 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

 

 

 

cost of revenues increased by 366 million or 491 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in the number of systems sold consistent with the overall increase in revenues as described above gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from 56 in fiscal 2013 to 165 in fiscal 2014 primarily due to a reduction in cost per unit resulting from the introduction of new power optimizer and inverter generations better component pricing resulting from economies of scale associated with our volume growth improvement in manufacturing processes and cost reductions in our existing product generations these cost reductions were partially offset by increased shipment and logistics costs which resulted as unexpectedly high customer demand forced us to shorten transportation time from our factories in china and hungary by using air freight rather than less expensive ocean freight 

 

operating expenses  

 

research and development net 

 

 

 

  

  

research and development net increased by 24 million or 154 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to a 18 million increase in personnelrelated costs as a result of an increase in engineer headcount the increase in headcount reflects our continuing investment in enhancements of existing products as well as development associated with bringing new products to market in addition materials consumption and other directly related overhead costs net of ocs grants increased in fiscal 2014 by 04 million and 02 million respectively as compared to fiscal 2013 

 

we plan to continue to invest in research and development as we continue to develop new products and make further enhancements to existing products 

 

sales and marketing 

 

 

 

sales and marketing expenses increased by 50 million or 392 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs of 29 million as a result of an increase in headcount to support higher sales volumes and accelerated expansion and higher sales commissions associated with our increased revenues in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 in addition costs related to trade shows and marketing activities the use of outside services and expenses associated with our international sales offices travel and other directly related overhead costs increased by 20 million we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand sales operations in the us and other geographies 

 

general and administrative 

 

 

 

general and administrative expenses increased by 10 million or 316 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to a 08 million increase in personnelrelated costs as a result of increases in headcount the additional personnelrelated costs were primarily the result of our ongoing efforts to enhance the legal finance human resources recruiting and information technology functions required of a growing company we expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company including costs to comply with the sarbanesoxley act and the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on the nasdaq global select market 

 

financial expenses 

 

 

 

financial expenses increased by 22 million or 3554 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in interest and financial expenses of 06 million related to the kreos term loan a 03 million increase in interest expense related to our revolving line of credit as a result of higher average outstanding borrowings during 2014 and an increase in expenses from foreign exchange fluctuations and other bank charges of 13 million

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the following table shows our cash flows from operating activities investing activities and financing activities for the stated periods 

 

 

 

as of june 30 2015 our cash and cash equivalents were 1448 million this amount does not include 36 million of restricted cash primarily held to secure letters of credit to vendors and bank guarantees securing office lease payments on march 31 2015 we consummated our initial public offering in which we sold 8050000 shares of our common stock at a price of 1800 per share resulting in net proceeds of 1312 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 36 million in offering expenses the majority of which have been paid by us as of june 30 2015 we maintain the net proceeds received from our initial public offering in cash and cash equivalents our principal uses of cash are funding our operations and other working capital requirements we believe that cash provided by operating activities as well as our cash and cash equivalents including the net proceeds from our initial public offering and available borrowings under our currently undrawn revolving credit line with svb as further described below will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months 

 

operating activities 

 

for fiscal 2015 cash provided by operating activities was 121 million derived mainly from a net income in the amount of 211 million that included 97 million of noncash expenses an increase of 463 million in trade payables and other accounts payable 137 million in warranty obligations 40 million in deferred revenues and 17 million in accruals for employees was offset by an increase of 485 million in inventories 196 million in prepaid expenses and other receivables and 163 million in trade receivables 

 

for fiscal 2014 cash used in operating activities was 178 million mainly due to a net loss of 214 million that included 35 million of noncash expenses although revenue grew 686 during fiscal 2014 we incurred a deficit in working capital while extending payments to our vendors to match collections from our customers and inventory management increases in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 of 99 million in trade receivables 74 million in prepaid expenses and other receivables and 107 million in inventories were offset by an increase of 194 million in trade payables 78 million increase in warranty obligations and another 13 million in accruals for employees and other accounts payable

debt obligations 

  

20 million revolving line of credit 

 

in june 2011 we entered into an agreement with svb for a revolving line of credit which permitted borrowings of up to 20 million subject to certain limitations based on our accounts receivable and inventories interest was payable at a prime rate plus margin of 075 to 275 the average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings during fiscal 2014 was 49 in october 2014 we had entirely repaid the revolving line of credit with svb 

 

40 million revolving line of credit 

 

in february 2015 we amended and restated an agreement with svb for a revolving line of credit which permits aggregate borrowings of up to 40 million in an amount not to exceed 80 of the eligible accounts receivable and bears interest payable monthly at svb’s prime rate plus a margin of 05 to 20 the revolving line of credit will terminate and outstanding borrowings will be payable on december 31 2016 as of june 30 2015 we had no outstanding borrowings under our 40 million revolving line of credit with svb 

 

in connection with the amended and restated revolving line of credit we granted svb security interests in substantially all of our assets including a firstpriority security interest in our trade receivables cash and cash equivalents the “svb priority collateral” the agreement contains certain financial covenants requiring us to maintain ebitda and liquidity at specified levels specifically we are required to maintain negative adjusted ebitda defined in accordance with us gaap as a net income plus b the extent deducted in the calculation of net income interest taxes depreciation and amortization plus c to the extent deducted in the calculation of net income noncash stockbased compensation of no greater than 1500000 as of march 31 2015 and positive adjusted ebitda of at least i 1500000 as of june 30 2015 ii 3500000 as of september 30 2015 and december 31 2015 iii 1500000 as of march 31 2016 and iv 3500000 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 and for each calendar quarter thereafter in addition we are required to maintain liquidity defined as our unrestricted and unencumbered cash plus availability under the revolving line of credit of 6750000 the amended and restated revolving line of credit also contains covenants that restrict our ability to borrow money grant liens pay dividends dispose of assets or engage in business combinations as of june 30 2015 the company met all covenants related to this revolving credit line 

 

term loan 

 

on december 28 2012 we entered into a term loan agreement with kreos providing for a term loan of up to 10 million which was fully drawn on the closing date the borrowings under the term loan were primarily used to finance working capital needs on january 26 2015 we repaid the entire outstanding balance of the kreos term loan 

 

  

  

interest on the term loan was payable monthly at a rate of 1190 per year compounded on a monthly basis principal is paid in 33 equal monthly installments from september 1 2013 through may 1 2016 the last of which was prepaid in advance pursuant to the terms of the term loan payments of principal and interest on the term loan were in euros 

 

in connection with the term loan agreement we granted kreos 563014 d1 warrants to purchase series d1 convertible preferred shares at an exercise price of 2309 the d1 warrants were exercised on june 18 2015 and we issued to kreos 154768 shares of common stock we believe that cash provided by operating activities as well as our cash and cash equivalents including the net proceeds from our initial public offering and available borrowings under our currently undrawn revolving credit line with svb as further described above will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months in the future we expect our operating and capital expenditures to increase as we expand our business and grow our revenue which results in increased accounts receivable and inventory balances and increased headcount our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to substantial risks described under the caption “risk factors” if any of these risks materialize we may be unable to generate or sustain positive cash flow from operating activities or raise additional capital we would then be required to use existing cash and cash equivalents to support our working capital and other cash requirements if additional sources of liquidity are required to support our working capital requirements or operational expansion we may seek to raise funds through debt financing or from other sources in the future but we can provide no assurance that these transactions could be consummated on terms acceptable to us or at all failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30 2015 

 

 



 

 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

in fiscal 2013 2014 and 2015 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “gaap” the preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 

 

  

  

revenue recognition 

 

we generate revenues from the sale of dc optimized inverter systems for solar pv installations which include our power optimizers inverters and cloudbased monitoring platform our worldwide customer base includes large solar installers distributors epcs and pv module manufacturers our products are fully functional at the time of shipment to the customer and do not require production modification or customization we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred iii the price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured provisions for rebates sales incentives and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded 

 

we generally sell our products to our customers pursuant to a customer’s standard purchase order and our customary terms and conditions we do not offer rights to return our products other than for normal warranty conditions and as such revenue is recorded upon shipment of products to customers and transfer of title and risk of loss under standard commercial terms we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine that appropriate credit limits are established prior to the acceptance and shipment of an order 

 

prior to may 2013 we provided our full webbased monitoring platform free of charge for a limited period of time after which the customer could elect whether to continue and receive a basic service for free or subscribe for a full line of services revenues associated with our webbased monitoring platform were recognized ratably over the term of 18 to 36 months the free of charge period and revenues associated with the basic functionality were recognized ratably over 25 years since may 2013 we have provided our full webbased monitoring platform free of charge and revenues associated with the service since that date are being recognized ratably over 25 years in the absence of vendorspecific objective evidence or third party comparable pricing for such service management determines the revenue levels of this service based on the costs associated with providing the service plus appropriate margins that reflect management’s best estimate of the selling price since may 2013 these revenues were minimal and we do not expect this to become a significant source of revenue in the near future 

 

product warranty 

 

we provide a standard limited product warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions our standard warranty period is 25 years for our power optimizers and 12 years for our inverters in certain cases customers can purchase extended warranties for inverters that increase the warranty period to 25 years 

 

our products are designed to meet the warranty periods and our reliability procedures cover component selection design accelerated life cycle tests and end of manufacturing line testing however since our history in selling power optimizers and inverters is substantially shorter than the warranty period the calculation of warranty provisions is inherently uncertain 

 

we accrue for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based on anticipated warranty claims and actual historical warranty claims experience warranty provisions are computed on a perunit sold basis are based on our best estimate of such costs and are included in our cost of revenues the warranty obligation is determined based on actual and predicted failure rates of the products cost of replacement and service and delivery costs incurred to correct a product failure our warranty obligation requires management to make assumptions regarding estimated failure rates and replacement costs 

 

in order to predict the failure rate of each of our products we have established a reliability model based on the estimated mean time between failures “mtbf” the mtbf represents the average elapsed time predicted for each product unit between failures during operation applying the mtbf failure rate over our install base for each product type and generation allows us to predict the number of failed units over the warranty period and estimates the costs associated with the product warranty predicted failure rates are updated periodically based on data returned from the field and new product versions as are replacement costs which are updated to reflect changes in our actual production costs for our products labor costs and actual logistics costs 

 

since the mtbf model does not take into account additional nonsystematic failures such as failures caused by workmanship or manufacturing or designrelated issues and since warranty claims are at times opened for cases in which the error has been triggered by an improper installation we have developed a supplemental model to predict such cases and recognize the associated expenses ratably over the expected claim period this model which is based on actual root cause analysis of returned products identification of the causes of claims and time until each identified problem is revealed allows us to better predict actual warranty expenses and is updated periodically based on our experience taking into account the installed base of approximately 66 million power optimizers and approximately 286000 inverters as of june 30 2015 

 

  

  

if actual warranty costs differ significantly from these estimates adjustments may be required in the future which could adversely affect our gross profit and results of operations warranty obligations are classified as short term and long term warranty obligations based on the period in which the warranty is expected to be claimed the warranty provision short and long term was 104 million 182 million and 319 million in fiscal 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively 

 

inventory valuation 

 

our inventories comprise sellable finished goods raw materials bought on behalf of our contract manufacturers and faulty units returned under our warranty policy 

 

sellable finished goods and raw material inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based on the moving average cost method certain factors could affect the realizable value of our inventories including market and economic conditions technological changes existing product changes mainly due to cost reduction activities and new product introductions we consider historic usage expected demand anticipated sales price the effect of new product introductions product obsolescence product merchantability and other factors when evaluating the value of inventories inventory writedowns are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and their estimated fair market value inventory writedowns are recorded as cost of revenues in the accompanying statements of operations and were 04 million 11 million and 10 million in fiscal 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively 

 

faulty products returned under our warranty policy are often refurbished and used as replacement units in warranty cases as we do not yet have sufficient history of refurbish utilization rates such products are written off upon receipt 

 

we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that we use to record inventory at the lower of cost or market however if estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

 

stockbased compensation expense 

 

we account for stockbased compensation granted to employees nonemployee directors and independent contractors in accordance with asc 718 “compensation — stock compensation” and asc 50550 “equitybased payments to nonemployees” which require the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stockbased payment awards based on fair value 

 

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model the stockbased compensation expense net of forfeitures is recognized using a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award which is generally four years estimated forfeitures are based on actual historical prevesting forfeitures 

 

key assumptions 

 

the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the fair value of the underlying common stock the expected volatility of the price of our common stock the expected term of the option riskfree interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment if factors change and different assumptions are used our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future these assumptions are estimated as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

if any of the assumptions used in the blackscholesmerton model change significantly future stockbased compensation awards for employees may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously 

 

the following table presents the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted to employees during the periods presented 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2013 2014 and 2015 we incurred a noncash stockbased compensation expense of 1078000 1082000 and 2956000 respectively we expect to continue to grant stock options in the future and to the extent that we do our actual sharebased compensation expense for employees and consultants recognized will likely increase 

 

common stock valuations 

 

prior to the public trading of our common stock which began on march 26 2015 our board of directors had determined the estimated fair value of our common stock at the grant date we perform the valuation of our common stock in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the american institute of certified public accountants practice aid valuation of privatelyheldcompany equity securities issued as compensation  in order to value the common stock underlying all option grants we determined our business equity value by taking a weighted combination of the value indications using two valuation approaches an income approach and a market approach 

 

valuation models employed in determining our enterprise value require the input of highly subjective assumptions in determining enterprise value under the income approach a discount rate is applied to the estimated future net cash flows of a company to derive a single present value of the enterprise the discounted cash flow model used to calculate our enterprise value included among others the following assumptions projections of revenues and expenses and related cash flows based on assumed longterm growth rates and demand trends expected future investments to grow our business and an appropriate riskadjusted discount rate the market approach estimates the fair value of our company by applying market multiples of the corresponding financial metrics of publicly traded firms in similar lines of business to our historical andor projected financial metrics we selected comparable companies based on factors such as business similarity financial risk company size and geographic markets in applying this method valuation multiples were i derived from historical operating data of the selected comparable entities ii evaluated andor adjusted based on our strengths and weaknesses relative to the comparable entities and iii applied to our operating data to arrive at a value indication 

 

enterprise value adjusted for cash and debt was allocated to the shares of convertible preferred stock warrants options and shares of common stock using an option pricing method or a probabilityweighted estimated return method “pwerm” depending on our stage of development the option pricing method treats convertible preferred stock warrants options and shares of common stock as call options on the total equity value of a company and uses the blackscholes option pricing model to price the call options this model defines the securities’ fair values as functions of the current fair value of a company and requires the use of assumptions such as the anticipated holding period and the estimated volatility of the equity securities under the pwerm the value of common stock is estimated based upon an analysis of future values for the enterprise assuming various scenarios and potential future expected outcomes eg an initial public offering a merger or sale continuing as a private company or dissolution with no value to common stockholders enterprise value is allocated to convertible preferred stock warrants options and shares of common stock based on the rights and characteristics of each equity instrument the resulting share value is based upon the probabilityweighted present value of expected future investment returns

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates customer concentrations and interest rates we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

approximately 44 and 22 of our revenues for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 respectively were earned in nonus dollar denominated currencies principally the euro our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located primarily the us dollar and new israeli shekel and to a lesser extent the euro and british pound sterling our new israeli shekeldenominated expenses consist primarily of personnel and overhead costs our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 29 million for fiscal 2015 a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates between the new israeli shekel and the us dollar would increase or decrease our net income by 20 million for fiscal 2015 

 

for purposes of our consolidated financial statements local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the us dollar on the balance sheet date and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rate as of the date of the transaction or at the average exchange rate to the us dollar during the reporting period 

 

to date we have used derivative financial instruments specifically foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign currency risks by hedging a portion of our account receivable balances denominated in euros expected to be paid within six months our foreign currency forward contracts are expected to mitigate exchange rate changes related to the hedged assets we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

 

we had cash and cash equivalents of 131 million 98 million and 1448 million at june 30 2013 june 30 2014 and june 30 2015 respectively which was held for working capital purposes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes since most of our cash and cash equivalents are held in us dollardenominated money market funds we believe that our cash and cash equivalents do not have any material exposure to changes in exchange rates 

 

interest rate risk 

 

as of june 30 2015 we had no outstanding borrowings  

 

concentrations of major customers 

 

our trade accounts receivables potentially expose us to a concentration of credit risk with our major customers for fiscal 2015 one major customer accounted for 246 of total revenues and as of june 30 2015 this same customer accounted for approximately 30 of our consolidated trade receivables balance we currently do not foresee a credit risk associated with these receivables in fiscal 2014 one major customer accounted for 191 of total revenues and in fiscal 2013 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of total revenues 

 

inflation 

 

we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the last three years if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

commodity price risk 

 

we are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials including copper which are used in our products prices of these raw materials may be affected by supply restrictions or other market factors from time to time and we do not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate commodity risk significant price changes for these raw materials could reduce our operating margins if we are unable to recover such increases from our customers and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations
